Just days after taking Bryson DeChambeau to the final hole at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Englishman added a 66 to his first-round 69 and leads by one shot from Matthew Fitzpatrick at the Players Championship. McIlroy has admitted a desire to add more length to his game, fuelled in part by DeChambeau\u2019s power play at the 2020 US Open, has triggered technical problems that were visible here. A second round of 75 at Sawgrass, added to Thursday\u2019s 79, meant McIlroy comfortably missed the cut. Afterwards, he expanded on the basis for his swing issues.    Related: Rory McIlroy says Tiger Woods is 'doing better' after car crash    \u201cProbably, like October last year, doing a little bit of speed training, started getting sucked into that stuff, swing got flat, long and too rotational,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cObviously I added some speed and am hitting the ball longer but what that did to my swing as a whole probably wasn\u2019t a good thing. So I\u2019m sort of fighting to get back out of that. That\u2019s what I\u2019m frustrated with.\u201d When asked why he had embarked on such a journey, McIlroy\u2019s answer raised eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said it wasn\u2019t anything to do with what Bryson did at the US Open,\u201d said the four-times major winner. \u201cI think a lot of people saw that and were like, \u2018Whoa, if this is the way they\u2019re going to set golf courses up in the future, it helps. It really helps.\u2019 \u201cThe one thing that people don\u2019t appreciate is how good Bryson is out of the rough. Not only because of how upright he is but because his short irons are longer than standard, so he can get a little more speed through the rough than us, than other guys. I thought being able to get some more speed is a good thing and maybe just to the detriment a little bit of my swing, I got there. I just need to maybe rein it back in a little bit.\u201d   Related: The day the turf stood still: looking back at sport's sudden shutdown     As McIlroy headed home, Westwood, at nine under par, has aspirations of claiming the Players just a month before his 48th birthday. \u201cI care less about the outcomes now,\u201d said Westwood. \u201cI still care about my performance and that in turn leads me to work as hard as I\u2019ve always worked. But I\u2019ve been working with a psychologist for a few years now and we just focus on the process, we don\u2019t focus on the outcomes and things we can\u2019t control.\u201d Fitzpatrick, who has made back-to-back 68s.

Prof Rory Medcalf, head of the national security college at the Australian National University, said the meeting showed the importance Biden\u2019s administration was putting on the region. He said Biden had \u201creshaped\u201d the Quad to be a more constructive and positive force that was open to co-operation, which was a significant shift from a Trump-era approach that was more confrontational. He said the Biden administration was instead opening the door for China to engage and co-operate with the Quad countries, while still allowing competition. \u201cAmerica wants to compete with China and win the hearts and minds of the rest of Asia, rather than take a zero-sum approach.\u201d Medcalf said the Quad would also give the US an opportunity to further push Australia to increase its climate ambition. Biden sent a signal on the priority he placed on climate by inviting his special envoy, John Kerry, to be part of his delegation, which also included the vice-president, Kamala Harris, and the secretary of state, Antony Blinken. Last month Kerry publicly acknowledged past \u201cdifferences\u201d between the US and Australia in tackling the climate crisis while calling for a faster exit from coal-fired power around the globe. Among the Quad grouping, the US and Japan have already committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, while Australia has expressed a preference to achieve the goal without making a firm pledge amid pushback from the Nationals. India also has not committed to net zero by 2050 but has promised to exceed expectations. On Monday the US and the UK issued a joint statement urging all countries \u201cto take the steps needed to keep a 1.5C temperature limit within reach, including through ambitious nationally determined contributions and long-term strategies to cut emissions and reach net zero\u201d.", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Minneapolis to pay George Floyd's family $27m in police custody death lawsuit", "full_article": "The city of Minneapolis has agreed to pay $27m to settle a civil lawsuit with the family of George Floyd, even as jury selection was under way in the murder trial of the former police of the former police officer, Derek Chauvin, who killed him. \nThe city council unanimously approved the settlement on Friday. The council emerged from closed session to announce the move, which includes $500,000 for the neighborhood where Floyd was arrested. \n \n  Related: Derek Chauvin trial: judge grants request to add third-degree murder charge  \n \nThe Floyd family attorney, Ben Crump, said in a prepared statement that it was the largest pre-trial civil rights settlement ever in a wrongful death lawsuit, and \u201csends a powerful message that Black lives do matter and police brutality against people of color must end\u201d. \nFloyd, who was Black, was declared dead on 25 May 2020 after Derek Chauvin, a former police officer who is white, pressed his knee against his neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd\u2019s death sparked mass protests in Minneapolis and across the US and led to a national reckoning on racial justice. \n\u201cI hope that today will center the voices of the family and anything that they would like to share,\u201d the council president, Lisa Bender, said. \u201cBut I do want to, on behalf of the entire city council, offer my deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd, his friends and all of our community who are mourning his loss.\u201d \nFloyd\u2019s sister, Bridgett Floyd, said in a statement: \u201cOn behalf of all of my family members, I am pleased that this part of our tragic journey to justice for my brother George is resolved.\u201d \nShe added: \u201cOur family suffered an irreplaceable loss May 25 when George\u2019s life was senselessly taken by a Minneapolis police officer. While we will never get our beloved George back, we will continue to work tirelessly to make this world a better, and safer, place for all.\u201d \nFloyd\u2019s family filed the federal civil rights lawsuit in July against the city, Chauvin and three other fired officers charged in his death. It alleged the officers violated Floyd\u2019s rights when they restrained him, and that the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force. \n \n  Related: Minneapolis on trial: how the year of George Floyd changed me and my city  \n \nGeorge Floyd\u2019s brother, Philonise Floyd, said of the settlement: \u201cEven though my brother is not here, he\u2019s here with me in my heart. If I could get him back, I would give all this back.\u201d \n\u201cThat dollar amount shows that what happened to George Floyd was wrong. It goes to show that we matter but it\u2019s an opportunity to show that these types of injustices are wrong. It was a clear violation of George Floyd\u2019s civil rights. It shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d said Todd Gramenz of Black Lives Matter St Paul. \nBlack Lives Matter Saint Paul was established in 2014 after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson. They have been organizing protests and lobbying since then. \nGramenz added that you cannot really put a dollar value on a life. \u201cHow do you value a Black man, who\u2019s innocent, that\u2019s killed?\u201d he said, and called for more police who kill to stand trial. \nOnly one Minnesota police officer has been convicted a murder before, a Black officer who killed a white women, yet several hundred Minnesotans have suffered police-involved deaths in the last 20 years. \nIt was not immediately clear how the settlement might affect the trial or the jury now being seated to hear it. Joseph Daly, a professor emeritus at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said it will be hard to stop jurors or potential jurors from hearing about it. \n\u201cJudge Cahill will likely explain to the jurors that each must make a decision based solely on the evidence they hear in the criminal trial,\u201d Daly said. \nAny praise for the settlement overlooks \u201chow many families that have failed to get a settlement and how they have failed to hold police accountable\u201d, DJ Hooker from the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar campaign group told the Guardian. \nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s good that we see that this happened with the $27m but on top of that, we need to make sure that happens for all families affected by police brutality. Everyone doesn\u2019t get the same amount. It\u2019s not fair. Everyone needs to be able to get money when their loved ones die.\u201d \nHowever, Hooker said holding police officers accountable and protecting the community by preventing brutality and violence was vital. \nL Chris Stewart, an attorney who worked with Floyd\u2019s family, said the size of the settlement \u201cchanges evaluations and civil rights for a Black person when they die\u201d. \n\u201cAnd what happens is that trickles down to decisions in the communities across this country. When there is a city council or a mayor deciding, \u2018Oh, should we get rid of no-knock warrants, should we get rid of chokeholds, do we want to change these policies?\u2019 They have 27m reasons now why they should,\u201d he said. \nMeanwhile, with jury selection in its fourth day, seven people have been seated so far, with the jury roughly balanced between white people and people of color, according to the authorities. \nOpening statements are expected around 29 March. \n", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "New York senators urge Cuomo to resign after governor refuses to quit ", "full_article": "New York\u2019s two US senators, Chuck Schumer, who is also the Senate majority leader, and Kirsten Gillibrand, joined national and state representatives late Friday afternoon in calling for Andrew Cuomo\u2019s resignation. The New York governor had earlier again refused to resign after a group of New York\u2019s most powerful and prominent Democrats in the House of Representatives joined calls for him to step down over multiple sexual misconduct allegations, and scrutiny over his administration\u2019s misreporting of Covid-19 deaths among nursing home residents. Schumer and Gillibrand put out a joint statement, saying: \u201cConfronting and overcoming the Covid crisis requires sure and steady leadership. We commend the brave actions of the individuals who have come forward with serious allegations of abuse and misconduct.\u201d It continued: \u201cDue to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations, it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York. Governor Cuomo should resign.\u201d At a press conference earlier on Friday, Cuomo denied all of the sexual misconduct allegations and castigated politicians calling for him to quit as \u201creckless and dangerous\u201d and engaging in \u201ccancel culture\u201d. \u201cI did not do what has been alleged. Period,\u201d Cuomo said. The governor said he wanted investigations into the allegations to proceed but added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to resign. Period. \u201cPoliticians who don\u2019t know a single fact but yet form a conclusion and an opinion are, in my opinion, reckless and dangerous,\u201d he added. His statement came shortly after a group of congressional representatives including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a standard bearer for the party\u2019s progressive wing, as well as Jerry Nadler, who chairs the House judiciary committee, and Carolyn Maloney, the chair of the House oversight committee. Nadler said on Friday that Cuomo had lost the confidence of New Yorkers. \u201cThe repeated accusations against the governor, and the manner in which he has responded to them, have made it impossible for him to continue to govern at this point,\u201d the congressman said. In a joint statement issued with Jamaal Bowman, another New York congressman, Ocasio-Cortez said the latest allegation of sexual harassment against Cuomo was \u201calarming\u201d and \u201craises concerns about the present safety and well-being of the administration\u2019s staff. These allegations have all been consistent and highly detailed, and there are also credible media reports substantiating their accounts\u201d. The duo added that the six accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct leveled at Cuomo came on top of claims that the governor\u2019s administration hid data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes, a combination that means that Cuomo \u201ccan no longer effectively lead in the face of so many challenges\u201d.   Related: Cuomo aides altered nursing home deaths report, health department confirms    In total, 10 of the 19 Democrats from New York elected to the House of Representatives have now called for Cuomo\u2019s resignation, with Kathleen Rice, who represents a section of New York\u2019s Long Island, previously calling for his removal. On Thursday, Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City and a longtime Cuomo rival, also urged the governor to step down, alongside 59 New York state lawmakers, meaning that almost all major New York Democratshave now turned on the state\u2019s chief executive. The New York state assembly also launched an \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d into the sexual misconduct allegations made by the six women. A separate investigation is being led by the state attorney general, Letitia James. \u201cThe reports of accusations concerning the governor are serious,\u201d said Carl Heastie, the speaker of the state assembly. The assembly judiciary committee will oversee the investigation, which will have the power to interview witnesses and subpoena documents. Forty-seven state senators have already said Cuomo should step down, more than the 46 needed to convict the governor if he was impeached. Separately, police in Albany said that they have been notified of the allegations and that these \u201cmay have risen to the level of a crime\u201d although this does not mean they have opened a criminal investigation. Cuomo had previously denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of women, although he has provided a general apology if any of his previous actions made anyone feel uncomfortable. On Friday, Cuomo, who was attorney general of New York and Bill Clinton\u2019s housing secretary and is the son of the late governor Mario Cuomo, said: \u201cI am not part of the political club.\u201d He said it wasn\u2019t clear why all the sexual misconduct allegations had been made now. He said they should be taken very seriously, but he denied any inappropriate conduct. \u201cLook, it\u2019s very simple: I never harassed someone. I\u2019ve never abused anyone,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cYou need to know the facts before you make a decision,\u201d he said, referring to his critics. \u201cPeople know the difference between playing politics, bowing to cancel culture and the truth.\u201d On the nursing home deaths, the governor has previously claimed his administration had to verify deaths of residents at hospitals, but critics questioned why that hadn\u2019t held up the release of data in other states. Cuomo\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Along with an allegation that the governor groped a female aide at the Executive Mansion last year, Cuomo is facing allegations of sexually suggestive remarks and behavior toward women, including female aides. One aide said he asked her if she would ever have sex with an older man. And another aide claimed Cuomo once kissed her without consent, and said the governor\u2019s aides publicly smeared her after she accused him of sexual harassment. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, has repeatedly said that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both support the attorney general\u2019s investigation into the harassment allegations.

The Etihad had maintenance done in April during the first lockdown but plans to have a first big overhaul in 11 years last summer were prevented by the pandemic.

He then underwent a late fitness test on an unspecified problem, felt he could pull through and told Jos\u00e9 Mourinho so. Equipped with this information Mourinho did what he almost always does, what Mauricio Pochettino did before him at Spurs and what Gareth Southgate also does whenever possible with England \u2013 he started Kane. The centre-forward would register two goals and two assists in the 4-1 win.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho brushes off Arsenal by insisting he only 'looks up' league table    Spool forward to Thursday night and another important game \u2013 the Europa League last 16, first leg against Dinamo Zagreb. Kane started, scored twice and was substituted on 84 minutes of what would finish as a 2-0 victory. When Kane sat down in the dugout, a club medic promptly affixed possibly the biggest ice pack ever seen to his right knee. Cue panic among the Spurs support, albeit only briefly. Kane would remove the ice before full time and Mourinho later said that he would be OK for Sunday\u2019s derby at Arsenal. It was only at the end of January that Kane injured both of his ankles against Liverpool, one worse than the other, to be forced off at half-time. There were fears of a three-week absence but he was back after 10 days to score the opening goal in the 2-0 defeat of West Bromwich Albion. Spurs lost the two games that he missed against Brighton and Chelsea \u2013 each by a 1-0 scoreline. It is stating the obvious to say Kane is fundamental to Spurs\u2019s hopes. When he has been a substitute in the domestic cups this season, the ties have been in the balance each time and Mourinho has always sent him on. The manager also started him in two of the three Europa League qualifiers, which were knockout games, and introduced him as a substitute in the other, at Shkendija, when it was 1-1. The sense in recent weeks is that Kane is beginning to feel the strain on his body and Mourinho\u2019s management of his minutes has become a topic for forensic analysis. How does he do it from here on? During the Europa League group phase, he was able to use Kane mainly as a substitute or not at all while he got through both legs of the last 32 against the Austrian minnows, Wolfsberger, without him.     Harry Kane clutches his knee during Spurs\u2019s 2-0 victory over Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday. The striker was later seen with an ice-pack over the joint, raising fears he will miss Sunday\u2019s north London derby. Photograph: Andrew Fosker/BPI/Shutterstock    But as the season enters its defining weeks, there do not seem to be many more games in which Mourinho would be comfortable to omit Kane. Perhaps next Thursday\u2019s second leg against Dinamo could be one. There are three at the end of the month that Mourinho would choose, although they are England\u2019s World Cup qualifiers against San Marino, Albania and Poland. It is doubtful Southgate would see it the same way and so expect a bit more back-and-forth between the pair. What is clear is that Kane has had and will continue to have a decisive say over how he feels and his readiness to play. The problem would come if his determination to be involved and the responsibility he embraces were to obscure common sense, and the impression has long been that Kane will always put his hand up for every minute; he will run and run until he drops. Mourinho insists that the approach is collaborative but the risks and edginess are pronounced.   Related: Harry Kane doubles up to sink Dinamo Zagreb and put Spurs in driving seat    \u201cHarry had a little knock the day before [the Palace game] \u2026 we had everybody fit in the team, we don\u2019t want to risk players,\u201d Mourinho said, when asked about Kane\u2019s original absence last Sunday. \u201cWe wanted to give a 100% guarantee that by playing he wouldn\u2019t affect the near future. We did just a little, if you want to call it a test or a little thing, just to make sure that he was right for the game and he was. \u201cWas it Harry saying: \u2018Play me?\u2019 Yes. Of course. Like everyone. With me, players make these decisions. When a player is a doubt \u2026 I trust the player more than anything and the relationship that we have between coaching staff, medical staff and players is a very professional relationship. But the players\u2019 feelings are very important.\u201d A related point \u2013 poor Carlos Vin\u00edcius. It is unclear whether the striker needed to be stood down for Palace but he is sure to have been disappointed to have featured only for six minutes against Dinamo as Kane\u2019s replacement, having generally started in the Europa League when available. If Vin\u00edcius did not appreciate the tough reality of being Kane\u2019s back-up when he signed on loan from Benfica last October, he does now. Mourinho denied that Kane\u2019s desire to play every minute was a problem, but he then veered off on a significant tangent. \u201cThe most difficult part of it \u2026 and that\u2019s the reason why I love Vin\u00edcius \u2026 is to have a very good striker that doesn\u2019t play many minutes and keeps motivated and working hard and fit and ready to help the team. So my special words go to Vin\u00edcius because he is a very good player and an amazing guy in the group. \u201cWhen you have a striker like Harry, that doesn\u2019t affect only in terms of goals scored but also the quality and dynamic of the team. We know that he has important routines [link-ups] built with other players and it\u2019s difficult to leave him out.\u201d And so to the derby, a fixture in which Kane is the record scorer; he has 11 goals in 14 appearances.

To its credit, the film, from The Blind Side writer-director John Lee Hancock, does find itself in slightly unconventional territory in its rushed finale but it\u2019s not a place that\u2019s either satisfying or smart enough to warrant the hushed solemnity that precedes it. It\u2019s a film trapped between a low- and a highbrow version of a story we know all too well, landing firmly in the middle of the road.   Related: Palmer review \u2013 Justin Timberlake aims for redemption in familiar drama    With elements of Seven and Zodiac in the mix, arguably the film it most resembles is Insomnia, both the Norwegian original and Christopher Nolan\u2019s excellent remake, its very title recalling a key recurring line about focusing on the small things during an investigation (Hancock insists any comparisons are coincidental with the first draft of the script written back in 1993). In what feels like an adaptation of a potboiler but is actually an original story, deputy sheriff \u201cDeke\u201d (Denzel Washington) finds himself unavoidably dragged back into the thrust of a case he\u2019s not supposed to be involved in (after an admittedly effective Silence of the Lambs-esque cold open). Once a celebrated member of the force, with age he\u2019s found himself pushed to the back, lumped with grunt work over anything more rewarding. But when another young woman is murdered, he\u2019s unable to resist, much to the chagrin of Jimmy (Rami Malek), the point guy on the case. The story also interweaves with an unsolved case from Deke\u2019s past as well as a local stranger (Jared Leto) who may or may not be involved.              Maybe if Hancock\u2019s film had been produced back in the early 90s, it would have at least felt like a more admirably serious-minded riposte to a sub-genre that often devolves into silliness. But at a time when even small-screen procedurals have perma-frowned detectives who spend more time haunted by their past than actually solving crimes in the present, it all feels a little too familiar and a little too minor. As a slow, meditative character-driven drama, it\u2019s too shallow and as a dark, disturbing serial killer thriller, it\u2019s too boring and so quite who this film is for remains a bigger mystery than the one at its centre. As probably the most reliable leading man currently working in Hollywood, Washington can put a shine on even the dullest of material and while he\u2019s no doubt stretched here, he avoids a mere sleepwalk and singlehandedly helps muster up just enough interest to drag us through. His character is mostly standard issue, but it\u2019s a sturdy, accomplished turn, the kind that only he can do quite this well, yet his other two Oscar-winning co-stars struggle. Playing a dogged LAPD detective with the same otherworldly strangeness that won him plaudits for Mr Robot and Bohemian Rhapsody (and makes him a perfect choice for a Bond villain), Malek is awkwardly ill-suited for the role, a performance so discordant, it makes one question the actor\u2019s long-term versatility and just how Hollywood will best make use of him. While Leto certainly looks the part of \u201cpotential killer of women\u201d with his pale sunken skin and greasy long hair, his line delivery is so embarrassingly unsubtle that he might as well have walked off the set of a Hammer horror parody, never convincing us that he\u2019s playing anything other than an Evil Movie Villain. That juicy killer-cop interplay, the spiky cat and mouse game that drives films such as this, just isn\u2019t really there, Hancock struggling to differentiate his film from the many others that have come before, as admirably hard as Washington tries. That aforementioned ending, while theoretically interesting, just doesn\u2019t land with the impact Hancock seems to think it does, a big swing that misses. Part of me admires him for it, but it\u2019s such an empty coda presented with such weight, urging us to take what\u2019s mostly a rather rote serial killer movie with awards-worthy seriousness, that it ultimately annoys (what it says about cops is also rather uneasy at this, or frankly any, moment).

Pak Ho had been taking his early morning walk on Tuesday, authorities said, when a man approached him to forcibly rob him. In the course of the robbery, the man allegedly punched Ho, causing him to fall to the ground, hit his head and suffer a traumatic brain injury.  Police on Thursday arrested Teaunte Bailey, 26, in connection with the robbery. Police said that through their investigation, they \u201clearned that the suspect has a history of victimizing elderly Asian people\u201d. In addition to Ho\u2019s death, prosecutors also charged Bailey with the robbery and assault of a 72-year-old Asian man at an Oakland senior care home in February. Authorities said Bailey allegedly broke into the senior living apartment, and shoved the victim while saying \u201cmoney, money\u201d at him, before leaving with the victim\u2019s phone and numerous other items from the home.

Earlier this year, an 84-year-old Thai man, Vicha Ratanapakdee, was killed in a seemingly unprovoked attack in San Francisco. Anti-Asian sentiments, fueled for years by the Trump administration\u2019s trade war with China, exploded with the pandemic and Donald Trump\u2019s bigoted usage of \u201cChina virus\u201d and \u201ckung flu\u201d. Advocates and community organizers have called for action and more awareness of anti-Asian hate, as well as unity between different communities in the face of racial divisions. Oakland\u2019s Chinatown, in particular, has experienced a spate of robberies and assaults in the past few weeks, including an incident in which a man shoved three individuals to the sidewalk. \u201cIt\u2019s just been one after the other,\u201d said Carl Chan, president of Oakland\u2019s Chinatown chamber of commerce, to the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s been so difficult.\u201d Chan said the Bay Area\u2019s Asian community feels unheard and unprotected, frequently complaining about the same individuals coming back into their neighborhoods to rob their stores and victimize their elders. Yet they still keep returning, and their community members keep getting hurt, Chan said. Chan is frustrated. To the community, these attacks feel like hate crimes, Chan said, even though authorities haven\u2019t qualified any of the assaults as such \u2013 by definition, a hate crime is a crime motivated by prejudice of a certain group, and he wonders how someone could repeatedly target one community if that person was not fueled by hatred of that community. \u201cAll the crimes being committed by the same suspect, coming back over and over and over again, how can we not believe that is a hate crime?\u201d he asked. Chan spoke briefly with Ho\u2019s three daughters, whom he described as heartbroken and hurt over their father\u2019s death. He said they were now especially concerned about the safety of community elders. \u201cPeople are facing one pandemic, we are facing two, and this is probably worse,\u201d Chan said. \u201cWe can take a vaccine.

A number of representatives of the No Beijing 2022 campaign said on Friday that they had met the IOC last October to give detailed insight into the abuses being faced by Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang province, as well as in Hong Kong and Tibet, and urge them to move the Games \u2013 but left feeling the IOC had \u201ccompletely dismissed our experiences and sufferings\u201d. More than one million Uighurs are believed to be in re-education camps, and on Thursday the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, confirmed that \u201cthe genocide against Uighur Muslims\u201d is something that would be a topic of discussion when US officials meet China directly next week. There have been growing calls for a boycott of Beijing 2022 because of the human rights abuses. But Zumretay Arkin, the program and advocacy manager at the World Uyghur Congress, said the IOC had dismissed her concerns.   Related: IOC reveals China has offered vaccines to Tokyo and Beijing Olympic athletes    \u201cWhen we met with the IOC in October, we asked them to listen to our voices but instead they completely dismissed our experiences and sufferings,\u201d she said. \u201cThey conveniently hedge behind political neutrality when it comes to China. \u201cThey also repeatedly told us that the IOC\u2019s mission was to create a better world \u2013 a world with absolutely no discrimination based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation,\u201d she added. \u201cA better world to us means a free and democratic world where there are no camps, no forced labour, no cultural and religious repression, no arbitrary arrest, no police brutality. A better world is a world without genocide. \u201cOur question was simple, does the IOC accept hosting the Olympic Games in a country that is actively committing a genocide? The answer we received was also very simple. Yes, the IOC is willing to host genocidal Olympic Games.\u201d Frances Hui, a Hong Kong activist in exile, said she had a similar experience when meeting the IOC. \u201cI talked about the fact that more than 10,000 protesters in Hong Kong were arrested in just a year, and the fact that China is violating international human rights obligations. And the first thing we heard from the IOC is: \u2018It is a very complicated world.\u2019 \u201cAnd I asked again: \u2018How are you going to legitimise a Games in a country practising genocide and murder?\u2019 and the IOC again replied to me: \u2018It\u2019s a complex world.\u2019 \u201cIronically, that is the same kind of rhetoric that people from China always tell me when I bring up the fact that two million Uighur workers are in camps,\u201d she added. \u201cWhen I talk about Tibetans as having their lands occupied by China, all they say is: \u2018It\u2019s complicated.\u2019 But no, it\u2019s not complicated.\u201d However, the IOC president, Thomas Bach, insisted one of the key principles of the Olympic charter is political neutrality \u2013 adding that the IOC is not equipped to solve all the world\u2019s problems. \u201cWe are taking this very seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we are not a super world government where the IOC can solve or even address issues for which the UN security council, G7 and G20 has no solution. \u201cWe have to fulfil our role and to live up to our responsibilities within our area of responsibilities, and the governments have to live up to their responsibilities in their remits. \u201cHuman rights and labour rights and others will be part of the host city contract. And on this, we are working very closely with the organising committee that we are also monitoring. This includes, for instance, supply chains or labour rights, and their freedom of press and many other issues.\u201d Bach said a boycott of the Winter Olympics over China\u2019s human rights abuses would not work. \u201cWe can only repeat and give advice to learn from history \u2013 a boycott of the Olympic Games has never achieved anything,\u201d he said. \u201cBe mindful of the boycott in Moscow in 1980 because of the intervention of the Soviet army in Afghanistan. The Soviet army withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 \u2013 nine years after. \u201cSo it really served nothing but punishing the athletes and then led to the counter-boycott in Los Angeles.

Newcastle United\u2019s captain most definitely subscribes to the view that when the going gets tough, the tough get going and, deep in stoppage time, he re-emphasised his importance to Steve Bruce\u2019s side. Minutes earlier Ciaran Clark had scored a freakish own goal which threatened to be calamitous in Newcastle\u2019s struggle to avoid relegation but, by meeting Jacob Murphy\u2019s left-wing cross and powering a bullet header beyond Emiliano Mart\u00ednez, Lascelles salvaged a potentially vital point. It is no exaggeration to say that equaliser might well have saved Bruce from the sack but his, and his side\u2019s position, remain precarious. They stand 16th, only two points ahead of both 18th placed Fulham \u2013 who play Manchester City on Saturday \u2013 and 17th placed Brighton \u2013 who face Southampton on Sunday before hosting Newcastle next weekend.   Related: Newcastle v Aston Villa: Premier League \u2013 live!    Outwardly at least, Bruce remains upbeat. \u201cIt was a hideous goal to concede, a bit of a fluke but we showed the desire to get back into the game,\u201d said the former Villa manager. \u201cThere\u2019s still 10 games to go and I\u2019m convinced we\u2019ll be okay. There\u2019s no question managing Newcastle is difficult. There\u2019s a huge spotlight - but that\u2019s the way it should be and I\u2019m ready for the challenge.\u201d St James\u2019 Park may have been virtually empty but the handful congregated inside clapped as loudly as possible during a heartfelt pre-kick-off minute\u2019s applause for Glenn Roeder, who died two weeks ago. Had the ground been full it would undoubtedly have been an emotional occasion as fans paid tribute to a much loved former captain and manager but it is now more than a year since the turnstiles last closed here. The absence of supporters has arguably kept Bruce in a job and home season ticket holders would doubtless have been unimpressed as Villa began in determinedly zealous mode, winning virtually every second ball. Nonetheless Joelinton really should have scored in the 14th minute after connecting with Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s through pass and sidestepping Tyrone Mings. The \u00a340m Brazilian was left with only Mart\u00ednez to beat but hesitated at the vital moment, taking one touch too many and permitting Ezri Konsa to make an intelligently timed interception. Both sides were without injured attacking catalysts \u2013 Jack Grealish in Villa\u2019s case and Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almir\u00f3n in Newcastle\u2019s \u2013 and their absence explained the under-employment of both goalkeepers. Although Martin Dubravka expertly parried Trezeguet\u2019s angled shot after the forward dribbled past Paul Dummett, Newcastle\u2019s keeper was generally well protected by a highly efficient defence. Bruce\u2019s problems lay further forward, specifically in an attacking department where Joelinton\u2019s industry could not camouflage the general shortage of improvisation and incision. If the effort and sometimes almost painful endeavour on view was creditable, the lack of elan suggested Villa may have hit a ceiling in their clamber up the table. Admittedly a Konsa header flashed across the face of goal and Clark did extremely well to block Bertrand Traor\u00e9\u2019s fierce shot but Matt Targett was slightly fortunate not to head an own goal after Joelinton\u2019s cross caught him unawares. Meanwhile Mart\u00ednez looked mightily relieved to see Murphy\u2019s shot rebound off the bar. \u201cThat was the best opportunity of the night,\u201d said Bruce. According to the so-called immutable law of the ex it is not uncommon for footballers to score against their old clubs but when Ollie Watkins\u2019s header took a hefty deflection off Clark, the former Villa defender appeared to have registered the winner for his old employers. Clark and Lascelles are close pals and the latter delighted in easing his friend\u2019s misery by heading arguably the most important goal of his career.

Vance made the announcement in a memo to staffers, ending months of speculation about his future and signaling it is likely to be a brand-new DA who sees the Trump case through, although Vance could still make a decision about charges before his term expires at the end of the year.

I never thought of this as my last job, even though it\u2019s the best job and biggest honor I\u2019ll ever have,\u201d Vance, 66, said on Friday.  His decision not to seek re-election was widely expected, but he held off on making it official while the US supreme court weighed whether his office could obtain Trump\u2019s tax records. The court ruled in Vance\u2019s favor last month. Some of the Democrats campaigning to replace Vance want to slash the office\u2019s budget, cut staff and skip prosecutions for a wider range of low-level offenses. Eight candidates are on the ballot for the party\u2019s June primary, an election likely to decide Vance\u2019s successor because Manhattan is so heavily Democratic. Vance ended most marijuana possession and subway turnstile jumping prosecutions, slashing the cases handled by his office by nearly 60%, to about 42,000 in 2019. He embraced diversionary programs for first-time offenders and established a unit to remedy wrongful convictions. The supreme court ruling on Trump\u2019s taxes was a capstone for Vance\u2019s tenure as district attorney, ending an 18-month fight with Trump\u2019s lawyers and bolstering a grand jury investigation that has drawn worldwide attention. Vance\u2019s investigation includes examining whether Trump or his businesses lied about the value of assets to gain favorable loan terms and tax benefits, and hush-money payments paid to women on Trump\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s one of the most high-profile prosecution jobs in the world, dramatized on TV\u2019s Law and Order and Blue Bloods. The district attorney oversees a staff of 500 lawyers and has a budget of about $125m. A separate forfeiture fund bankrolled by Wall Street settlements and worth more than $800m is used for grants to criminal justice and community organizations and big initiatives, such as testing backlogged rape kits. Vance, whose father was the former president Jimmy Carter\u2019s secretary of state, ran as a death penalty opponent and positioned himself as a criminal justice innovator, taking interest in national and global efforts to prevent cyber-attacks, gun violence and the theft of artwork and antiquities.

He will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Saturday for his first hearing, the start of the process that leads to a full trial for murder. \nIn a day of fast-moving developments, the Met announced that human remains found in woodland in Ashford, Kent, on Wednesday had been formally identified as the 33-year-old marketing executive. \nThe decision to charge Couzens, 48, was made by lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which authorises criminal proceedings in England and Wales. \nRosemary Ainslie, head of special crime at the CPS, said: \u201cFollowing a referral of evidence by the Metropolitan police related to the death of Sarah Everard, the CPS has authorised the police to charge Wayne Couzens with murder and kidnapping. \n\u201cThe function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges to a court to consider.\u201d  \nThe Met said that hundreds of its officers were working on the investigation, supported by colleagues from Kent police. \nCouzens was arrested at his home on Tuesday in Deal, Kent. He had previously worked at a garage run by his family in the county. \nAfter the announcement of the charging of one of their officers, the Met revealed that he had been with the force for just over two years, starting as a local officer before being transferred to the unit guarding embassies in the capital. \nIn a statement the Met said: \u201c[Couzens\u2019] first posting was to south area, where he joined a response team covering the Bromley area. He then moved to the parliamentary and diplomatic protection command on 1 February 2020, where his primary role was on uniformed patrol duties of diplomatic premises, mainly a range of embassies.\u201d \nEverard went missing after leaving a friend\u2019s house in Clapham, south London, at around 9pm. She is believed to have walked through Clapham Common on her way home to Brixton, a journey that should have taken around 50 minutes.  \nHer disappearance triggered a police investigation in which detectives scoured CCTV, video doorbell and bus camera footage for any clue as to what might have happened to her. Video taken from a doorbell camera captured Everard on the A205 Poynders Road walking towards Tulse Hill \u2013 the last known sighting of her alive.  \nSix days after she was last seen, the Met announced on 9 March that a serving officer had been arrested over her disappearance. Couzens was first arrested on suspicion of kidnap, and the next day arrested on suspicion of murder.  \nAlso arrested with Couzens on Tuesday at the same location was a woman aged in her 30s on suspicion of aiding an offender. She has been released on bail until mid-April. \nThe Met confirmed that for the second time since his arrest, Couzens had been found to have sustained a head injury in his cell at a London police station, which is covered by CCTV, and had been taken to a hospital for treatment. \nWith vigils protesting against violence against women planned for this weekend \u2013 which police are warning may breach lockdown rules \u2013 Met assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave tried to heal any breach with sections of the community that the force serves, and said: \u201cI know that the public feel hurt and angry about what has happened and those are sentiments that I share personally and I know my colleagues here at Scotland Yard and across the Met share as well. \n\u201cI also recognise the wider concerns that are being raised quite rightly about the safety of women in public spaces in London and also elsewhere in the country. This organisation and the men and women in it remain committed to protecting Londoners, wherever they are in this city.

Questions remain after Freeman's guilty verdict", "full_article": "In that golden decade when Team Sky and British Cycling won almost everything in sight, their media acolytes would often attribute their success to marginal gains, the pursuit of microscopic advantages in myriad areas, right down to washing hands before entering a building. \nHowever, a different form of handwashing took place after a medical tribunal in Manchester dispensed its guilty verdict against the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman for ordering banned testosterone \u201cknowing or believing\u201d it was for an unnamed rider. \n \n  Related: Suspicion stalked Sky but British public swallowed marginal gains story whole  \n \nFor in a statement released hours after the verdict, Ineos Grenadiers \u2013 formerly Team Sky \u2013 said Freeman had fallen \u201cshort of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly\u201d before adding that the \u201cteam does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance enhancing substance. No evidence has been provided that this ever happened.\u201d \nIt was an attempt to scrub away a devastating verdict that will send shockwaves through British sport and to move on. But this case is too important for that to happen. And while it might sound a strange thing to say about a tribunal that has already lasted 765 days, this is not the end, nor even the beginning of the end. To borrow from Winston Churchill, it is perhaps the end of the beginning. \nThree crucial questions remain. First, who was the rider? Second, who else knew? And finally, was Team Sky and British Cycling\u2019s success down to marginal gains \u2013 or were medical ones involved too? \nClearly, Dr Freeman lied repeatedly \u2013 including to UK Anti-Doping investigators over ordering testosterone in 2011 \u2013 although there was no direct evidence in the 46-page summary of the case that he had doped a rider. Instead it seems the tribunal appears to have decided that Freeman had told so many falsehoods that his claims that he bought 30 sachets of Testogel for Sutton as he was being bullied by him should also be rejected. \nThe botched cover-up didn\u2019t help. At the end of the General Medical Council\u2019s case against Freeman, Simon Jackson QC painted a picture of an ambitious doctor driven to take risks \u2013 and prepared to break anti-doping rules to succeed. \u201cThere is a truism in life that it isn\u2019t the lie that gets you, it\u2019s the cover-up. And what a cover-up it has been,\u201d Jackson said. It was impossible to disagree. \nBut, watching Freeman \u2013 who has suffered from stress and serious mental problems which delayed the case \u2013 in the dock it was hard to believe that he had acted as a lone wolf. Indeed the GMC appeared to accept this point, too, given it claimed he was working with \u201csleepers\u201d in Team Sky and British Cycling who had previous knowledge of doping. \n \n  \n  \n  Richard Freeman in a 2018 interview with the BBC. It has been difficult to believe he had acted as a lone wolf. \n  Photograph: BBC Sport \n  \n \nThe mind is also cast back to the incident that started this grim affair \u2013 the mystery \u201cJiffy bag\u201d delivered from British Cycling\u2019s headquarters in Manchester to the Team Sky bus at the 2011 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. We still don\u2019t know for sure what it contained, despite Sir Dave Brailsford telling parliament that it contained Fluimucil, a legal decongestant. \nStrangely we never heard from Brailsford at this hearing, despite him leading both organisations in 2011. Indeed, Freeman\u2019s QC, Mary O\u2019Rourke, noted that Brailsford was \u201cthe spectre missing at these proceedings\u201d. It was an evocative image, and a fair point. As she said he \u201cwould have been able to answer an awful lot of questions about what was going on at British Cycling and Team Sky. Yet he was never called.\u201d \nThe tribunal also reinforced the sense that the rosy picture of marginal gains was rather different from the reality. Not only did Freeman not keep medical records, he lost or destroyed several laptops. He also claimed not to know about the benefits of testosterone \u2013 despite being one of the leading sports doctors in the country \u2013 and said he had \u201cno knowledge\u201d of the World Anti-Doping Code related to possessing banned substances. \nSteve Peters, the head of science at British Cycling, also displayed a striking lack of curiosity in not asking why Testogel had been ordered to the velodrome, after being told about the package by the physio Phil Burt, while Shane Sutton, the head coach, spent \u00a36,000 of British Cycling\u2019s money on cosmetic dentistry and was accused by the tribunal of \u201cengaging in bullying behaviour\u201d. For supposedly Rolls-Royce organisations, British Cycling and Team Sky had more than a whiff of the Del Boy. \nThe tribunal made it clear in its summing up that Sutton was a credible witness and did not demand testosterone to treat erectile dysfunction. Yet during the case it heard testimony that he had doped as a rider in 1987 \u2013 something Sutton denies \u2013 while O\u2019Rourke also suggested: \u201cOne possibility [for the Testogel] is that Sutton was getting it for nefarious purposes and had a rider he coached who wanted it.\u201d \n \n  Related: Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict  \n \nIn a statement after the guilty verdict, Sutton stressed neither he nor Brailsford knew about the testosterone order. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for,\u201d added Sutton. \u201cHopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.\u201d On that, at least, most parties will agree. \nIt was Sutton, of course, who provided the most shocking moment of the hearings, when he denied using Testogel for impotence. \u201cI would have no problem in telling you it was for me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are telling the press I can\u2019t get a hard-on \u2013 my wife wants to testify that you are a bloody liar.\u201d \nFrustratingly there were other interesting lines of inquiry that were not pursued. O\u2019Rourke, for instance, revealed she had written to Damian Collins MP \u2013 the author of a damning digital, culture, media and sport select committee report into British Cycling and Team Sky \u2013 because she had \u201cbeen given to believe he received a quantity of information which did not get published which related to Mr Sutton\u201d. \nShe also claimed the Daily Mail had a \u201cwitness statement or affidavit\u201d signed by Sutton. That was held in the managing editor of the newspaper\u2019s safe as \u201can insurance policy against any potential claims for defamation by Sir Bradley Wiggins, Freeman or Sir Dave Brailsford\u201d. But again, we got no further. \nDespite the guilty verdict it was also hard not to feel some sympathy for Freeman, especially when he detailed how the pressure of the allegations against him had taken its toll when he met Sky chiefs in Canary Wharf in 2017. \u201cI was on my own, living alone, isolated,\u201d he told the tribunal. \u201cI started drinking again, taking more sedative medication. I was on a slippery slope. I was due to give evidence to the DCMS select committee but I found it very daunting. \n\u201cI went down to see James Murdoch and Team Sky with Mr Eastwood to be briefed at an imposing building at Canary Wharf. Mike Morgan was there \u2013 who is a big person in sports law \u2013 and Rupert Murdoch\u2019s lawyer was over from Australia. It was very tense. Pressurised. They wanted to know how I would answer certain questions. I broke down in tears and couldn\u2019t go on.\u201d \nThere was, at least, a neat bit of symmetry on Friday \u2013 as a story that began with revelations about a Jiffy bag being delivered to the Team Sky bus, ended with its former chief doctor being left under one.", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict", "full_article": "Team Sky and British Cycling\u2019s successes over the past decade have been left shrouded in suspicion after their former chief doctor Richard Freeman was found guilty of ordering banned testosterone \u201cknowing or believing\u201d it was for an unnamed rider to improve their performance. \nIn a devastating verdict that will send shockwaves through British sport, Freeman was also found guilty of concealing his conduct by orchestrating an elaborate cover-up after purchasing \u201ca doping \u2018drug of choice\u2019 for his sport\u201d. \nImmediately after the verdict, there were calls to find and identify the rider involved \u2013 while Clive Efford, a member of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, called for Sir Dave Brailsford to be suspended by Ineos Grenadiers pending a full investigation. \u201cUntil this is cleared up, all those involved shouldn\u2019t be anywhere near the sport,\u201d he added. \n \n  Related: Marginal gains or medical gains? Questions remain after Freeman's guilty verdict  \n \nFreeman, who worked for Team Sky and British Cycling between 2009 and 2017, had already admitted to 18 charges against him including purchasing banned testosterone, lying to the UK Anti-Doping Agency and keeping haphazard records. But on Friday he also was found guilty of three more charges relating to the delivery of 30 sachets of Testogel \u2013 banned in and out of competition \u2013 to British Cycling and Team Sky headquarters in Manchester in May 2011. \nCrucially the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) said it found Freeman\u2019s claims that he had bought the banned drug for former British Cycling and Team Sky coach Shane Sutton to treat his erectile dysfunction were \u201cimplausible\u201d. \n\u201cAs a highly experienced doctor, the reason Dr Freeman claims to have ordered Testogel [to treat Mr Sutton] was unconvincing in itself,\u201d it added. \u201cIt stretched credulity that a high-profile, experienced sports doctor would order a potential banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code; yet, despite the significance of this, fail to make a record of the intended patient, the circumstances, and the proposed off-label use. \n\u201cThe tribunal found that Dr Freeman\u2019s account of having ordered the Testogel for Mr Sutton required it to believe too many implausible, unsupported assertions, as well as having to overlook further falsehoods, on the back of those Dr Freeman had already admitted. \n\u201cThe position therefore is this. In May 2011, Dr Freeman, the team doctor for a team of elite cyclists \u2026 ordered a doping \u2018drug of choice\u2019 for that sport. Upon its arrival he was dishonest about why it had been sent, removed it from the Velodrome, and it was never seen again.\u201d Freeman had claimed last year that he had taken the testosterone home with him and flushed it down the sink but the tribunal noted that they only had his word. \n\u201cBearing in mind the breadth of Dr Freeman\u2019s dishonesty and the number of people he had pulled into it, the tribunal found his conduct incapable of innocent explanation,\u201d the MPTS report concluded. \u201cIt was clear that, on the balance of probabilities, the inference could properly be drawn that when Dr Freeman placed the order and obtained the Testogel, he knew or believed it was to be administered to an athlete to improve their athletic performance.\u201d The identity of the rider for whom the testosterone was allegedly ordered has never been established, nor did the General Medical Council attempt to prove it. \nSpeaking after the verdict, Sutton admitted the decision had cast a cloud over both Team Sky and British Cycling. \u201cI\u2019m saddened by the whole affair,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel for the doctor; that he ever got into this situation, and I remain disappointed that I was used as a scapegoat. It has caused great pain to both me and my family. But it also saddens me that this episode has cast a huge shadow over the success we enjoyed, both at Team Sky and British Cycling. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to stress that neither I nor Sir Dave Brailsford knew about the testosterone order,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to find out who the doctor ordered it for. Hopefully that will emerge from the investigation by UK Anti-Doping.\u201d \nThe tribunal accepted that Sutton had been a \u201cscratchy and irascible character\u201d who, \u201cwhen under pressure would indeed engage in bullying behaviour\u201d. However, it said there was no evidence that Sutton had been bullying Freeman in 2011 and they found him a credible witness. \nThe protracted case, which was expected to last a month when it began in February 2019, has dragged on for more than two years. However, Friday\u2019s verdict does not yet mark its end. It will sit again for three days next week to assess whether Freeman\u2019s licence to practice is impaired \u2013 and then again in April to deliberate on whether he should lose his doctor\u2019s licence or face any other punishments for his behaviour. \n \n  Related: Suspicion stalked Sky but British public swallowed marginal gains story whole  \n \nFreeman will also face two UK Anti-Doping charges related to ordering banned testosterone, including possession of a prohibited substance and tampering. \nIn a statement, Ineos Grenadiers \u2013 formally Team Sky \u2013 admitted that it was \u201cvery clear from the tribunal\u2019s report that Freeman had fallen short of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly\u201d. But it added: \u201cHowever the Team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance-enhancing substance. No evidence has been provided that this ever happened or that there has been any wrongdoing by any athlete at any point.\u201d \nMeanwhile Brian Cookson, the president of British Cycling between 1996 and 2013, called upon Freeman to give a full and frank account to UK Anti-Doping. \u201cIn many different ways, my team and I worked long and hard to ensure that success was well-founded on principles of integrity, fair play and competing within the rules, including and especially with respect to anti-doping,\u201d he added. \nHowever Damian Collins MP, the former chairman of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, said it posed \u201cmajor questions for British sport\u201d as well as British Cycling and Team Sky. \n \n  \n \n  Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n  \n \n\u201cHow could the chief doctor for Team Sky and British Cycling order a banned substance \u2018knowing or believing\u2019 it was to help a rider cheat the anti-doping rules?\u201d he asked. \u201cWas this a one off, who was the recipient, why was there supposedly no supervision of what he was ordering? This case is not just about the failure of one man to adhere to the rules and the standards expected of him, but a failure at that time of the management of the teams he worked for, including the national governing body of the sport.\u201d Meanwhile Efford said the ruling against Freeman exposed Team Sky\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d approach to doping as having been \u201ca tissue of lies\u201d. \n\u201cDave Brailsford gave reassurances about how clean his teams were and unless he was in full control of what was going on, he couldn\u2019t make those assurances,\u201d he added. \nWada said it had noted \u201cwith concern\u201d the decision and said it would work to support the authorities in the case \u201cto ensure that all possible lines of enquiry are exhausted.\u201dIt added: \u201cA number of questions still remain unanswered, such as the identity of the rider or riders who were the intended recipients of the prohibited substance ordered by Dr Freeman, and who else, if anyone, had knowledge of his actions.\u201d", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Uber passenger seen assaulting San Francisco driver in viral video is arrested", "full_article": "Police have arrested a woman who was seen assaulting a San Francisco Uber driver in a video that went viral this week.

The incident occurred on Sunday, after Khadka picked up three women in the city. Khadka filmed the video, which appears to show an unmasked woman in the back of the car coughing into Khadka\u2019s face and screaming at him.

The second instalment, Yellow, dramatises the rise of the fascist party Rex, which led to collaboration with Nazi occupiers. What is immediately arresting in NTGent\u2019s live-stream, with English subtitles, is the cinematic quality of the production. It is exquisitely filmed by Daniel Demoustier in the theatre, though not always on the stage. Shot almost entirely in black and white with some intermittent hues of yellow, it seems variously like a dance and a series of sorrowful tableaux of human suffering and collective delusion. Camera angles draw us into the roused faces of Belgian fascists, circling them dizzily as they spit out their rhetoric, and then drawing away to show them as a choreographed ensemble. Annette Kurz\u2019s set design seems more like a moving painting, with the actors often performing on or around a table that serves as a miniature stage. The full cycle of the war is shown, from the rise of the Rex party (\u201cHitler will not forget about the Flemish,\u201d says one character) to the eastern front and finally the bursting of the fascist bubble back at home. It is history told through family members and everymen, from the bookish and absent Jef, who is pushed into enlisting for war, to his father (Peter Seynaeve), mother (Chris Thys) and sister, Mie (Lien Wildemeersch). Their testimonies are combined with narrated letters written by Jef from the frontline, and there is a Jewish woman, Channa (Maria Shulga), who appears occasionally to tell her own story of persecution and escape \u2013 though frustratingly, not enough of it.     Courageous storytelling \u2026 Yellow. Photograph: Fred Debrock    The Flemish family are not unlike the villagers of Edgar Reitz\u2019s Heimat: eminently ordinary, their lives interrupted by ideology and war. As they fall under the spell of fascism, they are shown to be delirious, dancing manically, their movements erratic and puppet-like. And then they become small and suffering again, as that spell is broken. Alongside them is the story of L\u00e9on Degrelle (Val\u00e9ry Warnotte), the founder of Rex, and Otto Skorzeny (Philip Leonhard Kelz), an Austrian SS officer whose zeal vividly brings the \u201ccult of the F\u00fchrer\u201d to life as they speak, with almost childlike wonder, of shaking hands with Hitler or seeing him at rallies. Peter van Kraaij\u2019s script (with contributions from Steven Heene and Margit Niederhuber) resists traditional storytelling and as captivating and intense as the effects may be, it becomes opaque and too impressionistic at times. It never loses its atmosphere but because of its many narrative ellipses, the historical detail is hard to follow for those who are not familiar with it. The emotional voltage nonetheless remains, conjured by Ted Stoffer\u2019s movement, Sam Gysel\u2019s stunning score (from martial drumming to melancholic piano) and the actors\u2019 extraordinary performances, which give it an epic and tragic scale. NTGent intends to stage the production as a live performance in May but this filmed version is its own extraordinary achievement.  Yellow: The Sorrows of Belgium II. REX is next streamed on 19 March. It will be staged in Landestheater Nieder\u00f6sterreich in St P\u00f6lten, Austria, in autumn.

I remember saying to her: \u2018Listen, when you\u2019re going across the top, kick and don\u2019t look back.\u2019 She came down to the last and she couldn\u2019t resist, she had to have a little look back to see how far it was, and she was 15 lengths in front.\u201d \n \n  Related: BHA says Murphy's return from drugs ban delayed by failure to have tests  \n \nWith hindsight, it seems fair to say that had Blackmore known the money was down, it is unlikely to have made much difference. A decade on from her first winner at Thurles, she is one of the National Hunt weighing room\u2019s elite riders, with 12 Grade One wins and still in with a chance to finish the season as Ireland\u2019s champion over jumps. \nBlackmore can also look forward to her best book of rides at the Cheltenham Festival next week, including Honeysuckle, the favourite for Tuesday\u2019s Champion Hurdle, and A Plus Tard, third\u2011favourite for the Gold Cup. She is only 12-1, too, to finish the meeting as its leading rider for the first time. \nYet there were times, as there are for any young conditional, when as Hanlon puts it, \u201cpeople thought it was madness\u201d for Blackmore to take aim at the summit. Katy Walsh and Nina Carberry were exceptional and successful riders a decade ago, but both rode as amateurs and for families with a racing heritage that stretched back generations. Blackmore had no family connection to racing to put her on the first rung of the ladder, at a time when no female jump jockey had turned professional in Ireland since the mid-1980s. \n \n  \n  \n  Rachael Blackmore on A Plus Tard, her ride in this year\u2019s Cheltenham Gold Cup. \n  Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images \n  \n \nAttitudes have changed in the decade since, something Blackmore\u2019s sustained success at the highest level has helped to accelerate. But she has had to work tirelessly to achieve what might feel to some like almost an overnight success, with a further 11 Grade One winners since Minella Indo took the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham two seasons ago. \nHanlon played a major part in setting Blackmore on her way. \u201cShe rode her first bumper winner for me, her first hurdle winner for me, her first chase winner and her first point\u2011to-point winner,\u201d he says. \n\u201cShe was always a great girl, always very dedicated, and a great worker, unreal. She had a lot of ability and I knew she had it and she had the heart to try hard.

Her ride on Honeysuckle to win last year\u2019s Mares\u2019 Hurdle, meanwhile, was one of the best of the Festival, as Blackmore seized the initiative along the inside rail, turning in before holding off the charging favourite, Benie Des Dieux, up the hill. \n \n  Related: The day the turf stood still: looking back at sport's sudden shutdown   \n \n\u201cShe didn\u2019t really get our job,\u201d De Bromhead says. \u201cShe rode her way into it.

The science explained", "full_article": "Public health authorities want people to keep wearing masks and social distancing, even after they receive a vaccine. This might seem counterintuitive \u2013 after all, if someone gets a vaccine, aren\u2019t they protected from the coronavirus? \nThe answer is complicated: the vast majority of people who are vaccinated will be protected from Covid-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, vaccinated people may still be able to transmit the virus, even though they do not display any symptoms. \n\u201cWe know now the vaccines can protect, but what we haven\u2019t had enough time to really understand is \u2013 does it protect from spreading?\u201d said Avery August, professor of immunology at Cornell University. \nThat is because the the SARS-CoV-2 virus may still colonize the respiratory tract, even as systemic immune cells protect the overall body from the disease it causes \u2013 Covid-19. \nHere is how this works: \n \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nWhen can I stop wearing a mask? \nHold on to your mask(s) for the foreseeable future. Right now, there are several unknowns, which make mask-wearing and social distancing important to protect the wider community. \nFirst, scientists do not know how Covid-19 vaccines may protect against asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (as explained above). There are promising signs \u2013 but research remains incomplete. Researchers also do not know how long Covid-19 vaccines may protect people from the virus. \nScientists will also be closely watching how evolutionary changes in the virus, or variants, impact the effectiveness of vaccines. Researchers have already found efficacy of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine was reduced in South Africa, where the B1351 variant is present. \nHowever, the most important factor may be the extent to which eligible adults accept the vaccine. Children are able to spread the disease, but not eligible for the vaccine; some people may be too immune-compromised to take it; and others may face bureaucratic barriers to vaccination. \nWhat\u2019s the point of getting the vaccine if I still have to wear a mask? \nThink of mask-wearing and social distancing as a continuum of risk-mitigation strategies, which are in place while scientists conduct research, more and more people get vaccinated, and the prevalence of Covid-19 goes down. \nFor example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said people can gather indoors, without masks, with other fully vaccinated people. People are considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d two weeks after they receive their last vaccine. Those same people then need to be conscientious about social distancing and mask-wearing in public, as they could potentially transmit the disease in the wider community. \nThe hope is that as more and more of the public is vaccinated, fewer people will have severe cases of Covid-19, and the pressure on the health system will decline with the prevalence of the disease. \n\u201cHopefully we can get a majority of the population vaccinated,\u201d said Dr Bruce Y Lee, a professor of health policy at the City University of New York\u2019s School of Public Health. \u201cThat\u2019s when we can start talking about moving toward normal.\u201d \nWhen will we have these answers? \nStudies on the extent to which vaccines protect against transmission are continuing, and promising, but incomplete. It is unlikely the vaccines will provide complete, or \u201csterilizing\u201d, protection. Only a handful of vaccines are able to make that claim, including for example the smallpox vaccine. However, if a vaccine significantly reduced transmission, it would be very good news for the world\u2019s ability to contain the virus. \nUnder normal circumstances, these kinds of questions might have been answered in years-long vaccine clinical trials. In this emergency situation, stopping the disease was a more important goal, and available vaccines do that very effectively. \n\u201cWe would probably know as more and more people get vaccinated, somewhere near the middle of September,\u201d said August. \nImportantly though, vaccines do not necessarily need to provide complete protection to help fight the pandemic. \u201cIf everyone is vaccinated then there is less virus around,\u201d said August.", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Police told they cannot waive Covid rules for Sarah Everard vigils", "full_article": "Police forces have been warned not to allow vigils planned by thousands of people in dozens of towns and cities to honour the memory of Sarah Everard this weekend amid frustration about \u201cendemic\u201d levels of violence against women and girls. \nThe Guardian has learned that the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council (NPCC) told forces across England and Wales on Friday that they could not waive lockdown guidance banning gatherings, after it was discussed with the policing minister, Kit Malthouse. The document says that he is \u201csupportive\u201d. \nBut one force has decided that it will allow vigils as long as they are socially distanced and people wear masks, the Guardian has learned, reasoning that the outdoor events would pose little risk of spreading infection. \nVigils were planned on Clapham Common, south London, and in at least two dozen other towns and cities in the wake of the alleged murder of Everard, whose body was identified on Friday in woodland in Kent, more than a week after she vanished on the way to her home in south London. \n \n Map \n \nWhether or not the events would go ahead was hanging in the balance on Friday evening after a judge refused an application by the organisers, Reclaim These Streets, to make \u201can interim declaration\u201d that any ban on outdoor gatherings under coronavirus regulations was \u201csubject to the right to protest\u201d. \nBut Mr Justice Holgate suggested further communication between organisers and the police could be held \u201cto deal with the application of the regulations and [the rights to freedom of expression and assembly] to this particular event\u201d. \nIn a statement after the ruling, Reclaim These Streets said: \u201cWe are pleased that the judge spelled out in a detailed ruling that the law does not prevent the police from permitting and facilitating protest in all circumstances. The judge has made clear that the police must make their own decision about whether the protest can go ahead and that must include a proportionality balancing exercise. \n\u201cWe call on the police to act within the law now and confirm that they will work with us to ensure that the protest can go ahead within the context of the overwhelming public response to Sarah Everard\u2019s death.\u201d \nHowever, a statement from the Met urged people to \u201cstay at home or find a lawful and safer way to express your views\u201d. \nIn Scotland, it was announced that in-person vigils paying tribute to Everard, which were due to be held in Edinburgh on Saturday, had been cancelled by organisers in favour of an online-only event \nCressida Dick, the Met\u2019s commissioner, visited Clapham Common on Friday evening, walking with police officers and speaking to members of the public in the park. \nResponding to an outpouring of public anger and fear, the government on Friday reopened its consultation on violence against women and girls to allow the thousands of stories of abuse and violence experienced by women to feed into government policy. \nNimko Ali, a government adviser and campaigner on violence against women, said women had experienced the disappearance and death of Everard as a \u201ccollective grief\u201d. \u201cIt is like our wounds have been reopened, but when a wound opens up, that is a good moment to use antibiotics. This is a moment to use our platforms and our privileges and make sure we bring about change.\u201d \nOrganisers of the vigil in Clapham, near where Everard was last seen, have been locked in a legal battle with the Met police since Thursday, when the force \u2013 after initially apparently seeking to work with organisers \u2013 said the gathering would be unlawful under current lockdown restrictions. \nThey told the organisers that they could face tens of thousands of pounds in fixed penalty notices and criminal prosecution, the group said.  \nAt the emergency hearing, Holgate also refused to make a declaration that an alleged policy by the Metropolitan police of \u201cprohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances\u201d was unlawful.  \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    \n    Reclaim These Streets is a group of women in their 20s and 30s who live in the area of London where the marketing executive Sarah Everard disappeared on 3 March. The group has come together to help others honour the life of the 33-year-old, whose body was confirmed to have been found on 12 March, and push for societal and political change to tackle widespread violence against women and girls in the UK.\n    The group has formed five asks to achieve this aim:\n    Value women: Under new legislation going through parliament, a person can get 10 years in prison if they deface or bring down a statue. Statues are offered more protection than women. Women have a right to live without fear. Their safety must be prioritised. \n    Overhaul the criminal justice system: Only 1.4% of rapes recorded by police in England and Wales result in a charge or a summons. Violent sexual offenders must be held to account and victims put at the heart of the process. Only one in 7 victims of rape believe they will get justice reporting to the police. Victims' experience should shape our criminal justice system \u2013 they need to be consulted at every stage on how we can make changes to ensure justice. The government should consult with victims as part of its ongoing Rape Review, which it has as yet failed to do.\n    Count dead women: We count what we care about. And we can\u2019t tackle something until we understand it. The government needs to&nbsp; centrally collect data on women killed by men, including demographic and social factors.\n    Education on consent and boundaries: We must teach boys and men, from childhood, about consent and boundaries. We must focus on men\u2019s actions and behaviours. Everard did everything she could to protect herself, using every \u201chow to stay safe\u201d tool that women and girls are taught from a young age. It didn\u2019t make any difference. In her memory we must change the conversation.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe NPCC document is a rare attempt to forge a common approach among the 43 forces across England and Wales. It says \u201cwe understand the strength of feeling\u201d but stresses that Covid regulations do not allow large gatherings. It says vigils will have to be conducted \u201cin accordance with the law\u201d. Currently two people are allowed to meet for exercise in England. \nA senior officer on a force that has decided to permit vigils said: \u201cThis is a grey area and this is about reasonableness. The rules are far from clear and are yet to be tested in the courts. We have discretion, we choose which laws we enforce and when. If you think we are going to tell people after the alleged murder of a woman [that] you cannot hold a vigil, you are in cloud cuckoo land. People have to use common sense.\u201d \nIn a sign of rising tensions, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, added her voice to those calling for vigils to be allowed to go ahead, saying: \u201cWomen\u2019s voices must not be silenced.\u201d \nRayner said she would like to see the police work with the organisers to ensure that demonstrations could take place safely despite lockdown restrictions. \u201cThere\u2019s been an outcry, an outpouring of the long-term issues that many women and many girls face in this country. And that\u2019s the fear of not been able to go out, that fear of being attacked and the domestic violence that has increased,\u201d she told Sky News. \n\u201cI hope that we can come to a solution where the protest can go ahead in a Covid-safe way, that we can work with the police to make sure that happens because women\u2019s voice cannot be silenced. This is a moment where people need to stand up and listen.\u201d The women\u2019s parliamentary Labour party, which represents female Labour MPs, also backed the planned vigils. \nCampaigners and women across the UK have called for a societal shift and a policy overhaul to tackle the violence that sees one women killed at a man\u2019s hands every three days, according to the Femicide Census. \nThe past 12 months have seen a global and national increase in domestic violence, and an increase in rape reports even as the number of prosecutions has collapsed. A survey by UN Women UK this week revealed that almost all young women have experienced sexual harassment in public places. \nAndrea Simon, the director of End Violence Against Women, said the problem was now endemic. \u201cIt is well known that men who commit violence against women and girls are known to do so again and again and often against a series of women,\u201d she said. \u201cFor this to be a turning point, we need solutions that target the behaviour of perpetrators, not those which focus on the actions of women who are attacked.\u201d \nThe Women\u2019s Equality party has urged all women to share the texts they send to try to keep themselves safe using the #EnoughIsEnough at 9pm on Friday, which they will present to the government. \nEverard\u2019s disappearance as she walked home at about 9.30pm on 3 March, and the subsequent discovery of her body in woodland in Kent, have led many women to share their personal experiences of harassment and abuse. \nThe Labour MP Stella Creasy, who has campaigned for misogyny to be made a hate crime, said the volume of voices calling for action represented \u201canger at the violence, abuse and harassment that is so much part of the daily lives of women across the country\u201d. \nShe added: \u201cMaking misogyny a hate crime would be a start to changing both the way these crimes are dealt with and the culture of our policing \u2013 both actions which are long overdue in a society that wants to ensure everyone is free to live their lives and not under attack simply for being who they are.\u201d \nA government spokesperson said: \u201cAll of our thoughts are with Sarah\u2019s family and friends at this terrible time, and the government recognises why so many women and girls across the country want to pay their respects. We are still in the middle of a pandemic, which is why we urge people to do this safely and to continue to avoid mass gatherings.\u201d  \nJessica Leigh from Reclaim These Streets, who is also a Lambeth councillor, said she hoped the tragic events would prompt a national debate. \u201cWe hope that this can be the beginning of a conversation about women\u2019s safety and women\u2019s rights.\u201d", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Trident nuclear warhead numbers set to increase for first time since cold war", "full_article": "Downing Street\u2019s integrated review of defence and foreign policy is expected next week to signal a potential increase of the number of Trident nuclear warheads for the first time since the end of the cold war. Whitehall sources indicated that a cap on total warhead numbers \u2013 currently set at 180 \u2013 is expected to increase, although the exact figure is not yet known, in a move that analysts said was diplomatically provocative. The UK\u2019s stockpile of nuclear weapons peaked at about 500 in the late 1970s, but had been gradually decreasing ever since as the perceived threat from the Soviet Union and now Russia had been assumed to be decreasing. The last strategic defence review, in 2015, committed the UK to \u201creduce the overall nuclear weapon stockpile to no more than 180 warheads\u201d by the mid 2020s \u2013 and reducing the numbers of operationally available warheads to 120. Each warhead is estimated to have an explosive power of 100 kilotons. The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima at the end of the second world war was about 15 kilotons. The full reasons for the anticipated move are not yet clear but it comes amid speculation it is designed to help persuade the US to co-fund aspects of a Trident replacement warhead for the the 2030s. Its costs, too, are uncertain. \u201cIf this is confirmed, this would be a highly provocative move,\u201d said David Cullen, the director of the Nuclear Information Service. \u201cThe UK has repeatedly pointed to its reducing warhead stockpile as evidence that it is fulfilling its legal duties under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. \u201cIf they are tearing up decades of progress in reducing numbers, it will be a slap in the face to the 190 other members of the treaty, and will be regarded as a shocking breach of faith.\u201d Britain has operated its own nuclear weapons since the 1950s but for the past 60 years, following an agreement between the then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, and the then US president, John F Kennedy, the UK has been heavily dependent on US technology. Trident missiles are deployed in four submarines, one of which is continuously at sea to make sure it can strike back in the event of an unprovoked nuclear attack. It relies on an existing US W76 warhead, based on a 1970s design, called Holbrook. However, the W76 is ageing, and the US has proposed developing a more powerful replacement, called the W93. The UK is particularly keen for the US to start work on the W93 and last summer the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, lobbied Congress for the work to go ahead. British MPs voted to renew Trident in principle in 2016, but the Commons is expected to have to vote on a new warhead at some point. In 2016, the Conservatives almost uniformly backed renewal, the SNP voted against, while Labour was split. The MoD has said developing the next generation of Dreadnought submarines to carry the new warhead would cost \u00a330bn plus a \u00a310bn contingency. But officials have so far refused to say how much the warhead would cost. An MoD spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is committed to maintaining its independent nuclear deterrent, which exists to deter the most extreme threats to our national security and way of life. \u201cReplacing the warhead and building four new Dreadnought class submarines are UK sovereign programmes that will maintain the deterrent into the future.

The woman had been slowly starving for the past year and it took three days to fix it    When the Covid supplement was introduced, she rushed out to buy new underwear and then sent a picture of them to Ruston as proof of what she was spending her money on. As the old adage goes, \u201cShe is not backwards in coming forwards.\u201d So why didn\u2019t she ask for help? But is that the right question to ask? Surely the onus is not on the less fortunate to beg and kowtow for bread and water? The real question is, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anybody notice?\u201d Perhaps the simplest answer is: \u201cBecause things like this shouldn\u2019t happen in Australia.\u201d We\u2019re simply not used to them. It is beyond our ken. None of us in the poverty network, except one, had experience of dealing with people starving to death. So we didn\u2019t recognise the signs. It was M, a fabulous activist in her late 70s with the spirit of a 30-year-old, who finally drew the threads together. As we were coming home from a particularly onerous meeting, she said: \u201cI\u2019m really worried about Rita. I\u2019m frightened she\u2019s starving to death. I\u2019ve seen it in Cambodia.\u201d The slow-spinning cogs of cognitive dissonance began to clatter and whir as my brain went into meltdown. I understood as fact that no one could survive on jobseeker but I could not fathom that I personally knew and was becoming friends with someone who was starving in Australia. The dissonance dissipated and was replaced by invective ire. I began to swear, profusely, then I somehow reined in my inner Boudicca and clicked into fix-it mode instead. \u201cOK \u2013 I\u2019ve got stuff in my pantry that I\u2019m not using \u2013 have you?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cRight. We do a ring-around and ask people to donate a few cans of non-perishables and we fill her pantry. If her pantry is full then she won\u2019t starve. She may not be eating well, but she\u2019ll be eating something.\u201d M concurred and we discussed tactics. I started to ring everybody I knew. Most people were great. They asked practical things \u2013 does she have any food allergies? What won\u2019t she eat? Others were not so accommodating. They questioned her spending, they asked if I\u2019d seen her cupboards. Regardless of the less charitable, it took three days to fill Rita\u2019s pantry. It was that easy. The woman had been slowly starving for the past year and it took three days to fix it. There is still food coming in \u2013 the leftover non-perishables have been taken to our shared office space to be used as an emergency stash for anybody who needs it. We\u2019ve called it Rita\u2019s Pantry and intend to make it an ongoing feature of our activism against the war on the poor. None of us have any money. We have no resources except ourselves. If it\u2019s that easy for a few \u201cwelfarers\u201d to get together to help someone \u2013 then what in all the gods\u2019 names is wrong with our government?   Related: I am living in fear of what life will be like when jobseeker is cut back | Julie Stephen    Allowing poverty to continue is a political choice. The government proved that when it waved its political wand and magically the jobseeker payment was doubled by the addition of the Covid supplement. It\u2019s about priorities and ideological preferences, not a lack of resources. It is also a political choice to plunge more than 1.5 million people back into abject impecunity when the supplement ends, thus condemning them to homelessness and hunger. The cruelty of it is breathtaking. I asked Rita why she thought she couldn\u2019t ask for help. She said she had spent her life caring for others as a mother, as a carer. Now that it was she who needed to be taken care of, the thought of being a burden was too much to bear. She was simply too humiliated. Even though we were not intentionally struthious, I still think we should have picked up on the signs.

Growing up in Sydney as a young Aboriginal person, I was always looking for pieces that reflected my contemporary identity, but in a way that was grounded in our cultural traditions. As an adult, I feel like I found that in this dress. It gives me the opportunity to continue our traditions by showcasing the stories and values we hold. It\u2019s also a great conversation starter and a gentle and beautiful way to share who we are as a people. I wore this dress at a fashion event where we were sharing our favourite First Nations fashion pieces and what they represented for us. It was a day of connection and celebration. I feel nothing but joy in my Ngali. Audrey Khaing-Jones, CEO of GlamCorner     Audrey Khaing-Jones in a colourful printed dress from C/Meo Collective.

It was a \u201cpinch me\u201d moment on how far we\u2019ve come in helping reduce fashion waste through rental. I chose to wear the C/Meo Collective dress at the time because it was part of our GlamCorner rental offering, and the shape and print made me feel sophisticated yet fun. I loved the dress so much I bought it at the end of its rental life cycle and it always manages to lift my mood when I wear it.

I was shopping in their store, spotted the shirt in the sale section of the rack and my eyes lit up. I love a bargain. This piece makes me happy because at the time I had a sharp focus on developing my wardrobe and wanting to buy key pieces that fit my personal style. The colour was perfect and the shirt was made so well. I can dress it up for a night out with mates or make it casual to go out for a coffee. I\u2019ve been able to wear it to many friends\u2019 events and it\u2019s travelled the world with me. This shirt makes me feel confident and comfortable.

This wasn\u2019t going to be my immediate choice, and I\u2019m being a little courageous with this choice, but it\u2019s heartfelt. I was recently diagnosed with neck cancer and while I\u2019m grateful to be in remission, like many cancer warriors I\u2019ve taken an ego hit and have some scares to prove it. Wearing this neck scarf was surprisingly powerful. It actually highlighted my vulnerability and gave me some bravado too.

It\u2019s been a core piece in my wardrobe, and reminds me of the time I spent studying at the Accademia Italiana Arte Moda in Florence, Italy. It was such an inspiring time in my life; the art, architecture and food, not to mention the education in tailoring. This piece makes me feel incredibly optimistic and grateful for that wonderful experience. Andie Halas, founding director of Thread Together     Andie Halas, wearing a dress from The Art Club.

This dress is a great mix of feminine and masculine \u2013 which is my style. A classic dress that is based on the traditional men\u2019s shirting, though with the femininity of fabric and the softness of the ruffle at the waist. This dress makes me feel strong and at ease and I know it will be worn throughout the warmer months and for years to come. It is important to me to buy designs that last the test of time, that become like reliable friends.

The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission\u2019s executive director of legal services, the director of communications and the director of governance and risk have all left the commission \u2013 the latest in a string of departures over the past year. The departures mean that the four women who made up half of Ibac\u2019s executive in 2019 have since left. Guardian Australia revealed in December that an Ibac internal staff survey showed more than half of respondents did not feel psychosocially safe at work, with 14% experiencing bullying, 11% discrimination, 13% sexual harassment and 7% occupational violence in the past year.   Related: Victoria police officer dismissed for sexual harassment reinstated    Results from the latest People Matter survey were provided to staff in January. The survey, which was completed in October, showed that figures regarding sexual harassment and bullying were steady, despite staff spending much of the time since the previous survey working from home, and efforts from management to improve the culture. Since that time, three more senior women and other female staff have left the agency or tendered their resignations. Veronica McGowan, the head of communications, left after Megan O\u2019Halloran, a former work colleague of Ibac\u2019s chief executive, Marlo Baragwanath, was appointed into a newly created senior communications role. The new role would have relegated McGowan, who had been at the agency since 2016, to a less senior position. Baragwanath is understood to have declared a conflict of interest in relation to the appointment of O\u2019Halloran, who she worked with at WorkSafe, and not played any part in her recruitment as director of communication and engagement. Baragwanath said the role was subject to an open merit-based recruitment process in full compliance with public sector requirements. Baragwanath, who has been in the role since January last year, said it was inevitable staff would leave the relatively small authority, which has been operating for the past eight years, and that the departures provided opportunities for renewal. She would not comment on the reasons why so many senior women were leaving the commission. Baragwanath also did not address concerns raised by some Ibac staff to Guardian Australia that the culture of the workplace was so dire that, in some instances, it could foster corruption by discouraging people from speaking out. \u201cStrengthening our organisational culture so that staff feel supported and empowered to do their best remains an ongoing priority for me and the broader leadership team at Ibac,\u201d Baragwanath told Guardian Australia in a statement. \u201cOver the last 12 months we implemented a range of internal programs with a clear focus on wellbeing, appropriate behaviours and health and safety. Our most recent People Matter Survey, which provides a snapshot of staff sentiment in October last year, shows our efforts led to more staff feeling better supported in these areas. \u201cHowever, in part due to the impact of Covid-19 and remote working, we did not achieve all we set out to do. I have spoken openly with staff to acknowledge this.\u201d It is understood that despite the internal survey results, few formal complaints have been made about sexual harassment and bullying. \u201cOver the coming 12 months we will continue to focus on improving staff engagement and wellbeing, and on how our leaders can better support their teams and provide clearer strategy and direction,\u201d Baragwanath said.

Ibac and the Victorian ombudsman both called for greater funding last year. Baragwanath, Ibac commissioner Robert Redlich QC and Glenn Ockerby, Ibac\u2019s director of corporate services, along with senior staff from the ombudsman\u2019s office, will front the Victorian parliament\u2019s integrity and oversight committee on Monday.

If you think that sounds like hyperbole, you have not seen a David Gulpilil movie. \n \n  Related: Firestarter: The Story of Bangarra review \u2013 an engrossing celebration of artistic creation  \n \nPlenty are sampled in My Name Is Gulpilil, which oscillates between present and past, drawing on portrayals plucked from the actor\u2019s rich oeuvre to illustrate different parts of his life and character \u2013 his story, this time, not someone else\u2019s. Moments from his films (so smoothly integrated by editor Tania M. Nehme) feature like personal footprints, snapshots of a life impressed on to celluloid. \nThe film plays out in the spirit of a living wake, celebrating its subject while contemplating the inevitable. One Bu\u00f1uelian shot captures the actor from above, lying with his eyes closed in a coffin with red lining, his body covered in old film reels. They flow out of it, as if they are a natural part of the man himself. \nIn a sense, of course, they are. Gulpilil has been present on our screens for a full half century, his career beginning with a breakthrough performance in Nicolas Roeg\u2019s great 1971 film Walkabout. Back then Gulpilil was a teenager with a cheeky gleam in his eyes \u2013 now, in his 60s with lung cancer, his spirit and humour are still apparent but those eyes have dimmed. \nLiving in Murray Bridge, South Australia with his carer Mary, who he says will be \u201cwith me until I\u2019m gone\u201d, we see Gulpilil take pills \u2013 including for pain management and anxiety \u2013 and puff on an inhaler. Throughout the course of the running time he philosophises on differences in attitudes towards medicine in white and Indigenous cultures, the former involving its determination to \u201cwin\u201d \u2013 to \u201cbeat\u201d or \u201cconquer\u201d illness. But Gulpilil is under no illusions about his own situation, declaring he is going \u201cback to country on a one-way ticket\u201d. \n \n  \n  \n  Molly Reynolds\u2019 film This Is Gulpilil plays out in the spirit of a living wake, celebrating its subject while contemplating the inevitable. \n  Photograph: Bonnie Paku \n  \n \nHe introduces the film as \u201cmy story of my story\u201d, implying dual layers: his life and his life in film. There have been other nonfiction productions about or involving the actor, including Bill Leimbach\u2019s 48-minute documentary Walkabout to Hollywood, from 1980, which contains interesting footage revealing Gulpilil\u2019s intellect and personality as a (much younger) artist. And another directed by Reynolds \u2013 2015\u2019s excellent Another Country, an essay-like analysis of Gulpilil\u2019s then home town of Ramingining in the Northern Territory, which uses the location as a case study to explore incompatible aspects of white and Indigenous Australian cultures. \nBut My Name Is Gulpilil is on another level: so sublimely made, so humane, so elegant in construction. Among other things, it is a reflection on mortality and an acknowledgment of the movie medium as a form of mausoleum, fossilising (though the great director Andrei Tarkovsky preferred to call this \u201csculpting\u201d) moments in time, and here, bringing them back, for a story of a story. \nSeveral moments show Gulpilil walking towards the camera, or walking away. Sometimes he does this in the same shot. Always these moments crystallise a subtextual message about looking forward and looking backwards. The director does so without turning a blind eye to her subject\u2019s shortcomings; in one scene Gulpilil stands alone in a hospital or medical centre corridor, as we hear audio snippets from news bulletins reporting on controversies and criminal charges he faced over years \u2013 like grim memories tumbling around his psyche. \n \n  Related: High Ground review \u2013 Simon Baker narrowly escapes white saviour tropes in colonial Australia  \n \nSeeing present-day Gulpilil on a boat evokes memories of films that position him close to water, geographically and spiritually. Among them, the creature feature Dark Age, about the pursuit of a \u201cdreaming croc\u201d, Peter Weir\u2019s end-times drama The Last Wave, the final moments of Goldstone, which present Gulpilil as a kind of whispered memory in the mind of Aaron Pedersen, and those sublime coastal scenes from the original Storm Boy. \nElsewhere in the documentary, in a personal reflection from the man himself, we learn that \u201cGulpilil\u201d means \u201cKingfisher\u201d. And so, all those scenes next to water retrospectively acquire an almost cosmic sense of purpose, as if positioning the great actor near creeks, rivers, oceans was preordained.

The Pacific\u2019s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been one of self-reliance and resistance: to turn to its communities and churches, its lands and seas. The region has escaped \u2013 so far \u2013 the very worst of the health ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic. A handful of islands remain defiantly coronavirus-free, though that number dwindles almost weekly now. But even without high rates of infections from the virus, the impact of the pandemic has been widespread, and profound.   Related: Papua New Guinea forced to wait for vaccines as coronavirus crisis spirals out of control    The enforced border closures have isolated communities, threatened food supplies, crippled businesses and devastated economies, particularly across a part of the world so dependent on tourism and exports. And the global pandemic has come on top of other disasters to hit the Pacific. At one stage in April 2020, Vanuatu was simultaneously grappling with the triple crises of Covid-19, a category-five cyclone in its northern islands and an erupting volcano in its south. A documentary from the Australian National University\u2019s Australia Pacific Security College, told through the eyes of four Pacific video diarists, charts daily life on islands isolated by Covid-19. Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience, shows the initial response to reports of the spreading virus as a microcosm of the fear which seized the world in the pandemic\u2019s inchoate early days.     Dorothy Tekwie says there is significant fear of the coronavirus in Vanimo, in northern New Guinea island.

The pandemic has restructured families, with people returning from cities to their ancestral homes, and it has rekindled traditional ways of life, including farming, with new gardens planted to grow food.     Many in Pacific islands have turned to farming and fishing to cope with shuttered economies forced by the Covid-19 lockdowns. From Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience by the Australia Pacific Security College. Photograph: Australia National University    The impact of Covid-19 on mental health across the Pacific has been profound. \u201cI just can\u2019t wait for the world to get back to normal,\u201d Leo Pugram, from the island of Yap says, staring into the camera. \u201cI just can\u2019t wait, because I know I\u2019m not the only one getting depressed, I\u2019m not the only one thinking about suicide.

Leo Pugram is one of four video diarists in Pacific Lockdown: Sea of Resilience by the Australia Pacific Security College, released in March 2021 Photograph: ANU    In November 1918, the supply ship Talune, which had sailed from New Zealand, was inexplicably allowed to dock in the Samoan capital of Apia, despite the captain\u2019s declaration there were sailors on board carrying the Spanish flu which was wreaking havoc across the world. No quarantine requirements were enforced. Within a month, up to 10,000 people were dead: a quarter of the island\u2019s population. Infected bodies were left on the roadside, buried anonymously in a harbour-side mass grave. The documentary also highlights the inconsistencies in the region\u2019s response to the modern pandemic. The ANU\u2019s Dr Henry Ivarature points out that the Pacific countries with the highest rates of Covid-19 infections are colonies, unable to exercise sovereign control over their own borders: French Polynesia, which went from 62 infections to more than 20,000 after its borders were opened to tourists last August, and American territory Guam, where the arrival of a US navy aircraft carrier seeded the virus on the island. Also badly affected has been the contested Indonesian province of Papua, suffering the highest infection rate in Melanesia. \u201cThe geo-political consequences of the pandemic in the Pacific remains to be seen,\u201d Ivarature says, \u201cbut if you look at the trends \u2026 Covid infections are very high in countries that do not have control over their own borders.\u201d     In countries such as the Federated States of Micronesia, which remained free of confirmed Covid cases, significant social and cultural events were allowed to resume after periods of lockdown.

Palau has fully vaccinated more than 20% of its population with two doses. But Papua New Guinea, where uncontrolled community transmission threatens to overwhelm the country\u2019s fragile health system, there has not been a single vaccine administered, and the first doses won\u2019t arrive in the country until next month.

Calissa Aldridge, Asic\u2019s senior executive for market supervision, told Guardian Australia that watching trends on social media was something Asic increasingly needed to incorporate into its regulatory work. \u201cWe use a range of different tools to monitor activity on social media,\u201d she said. \u201cPredominantly the focus is on scams, but we also have a focus at the moment at really looking at the changing dynamics on social media and \u2026 working to engage with some of the moderators and be more proactive in that engagement.\u201d But many of the factors that played into the GameStop saga could not be replicated on Australia\u2019s stock market, she said. \u201cWe do see some stocks that have quite a bit of volatility but we really don\u2019t think we are going to see the same sort of extremes we saw in the US. \u201cWe don\u2019t see short selling anywhere near the extremes seen in the US.\u201d Asic has set up working groups within its organisation to monitor social trends as retail investing continues to boom during the pandemic.

The regulator is concerned that investors who have jumped into trading during Covid, in markets in Australia and overseas, may not be fully informed about what they have been investing in. One concern is an increase in copy trading, where investors sign up for services that automatically copy investments made by other traders. \u201cActivity like copy trading has been around for a while but it\u2019s being marketed in a more targeted way and we\u2019re seeing more uptake in copy trading,\u201d Aldridge said. \u201cThey may not understand\u2026 what the implications are of the trade potentially going bad, and it is amplified when we look at products that are leveraged. This isn\u2019t limited to trading in shares.\u201d The regulator was also worried about gamification of trading apps where people are encouraged to trade more, and the apps have game-like rewards. \u201cIt\u2019s really about enticing people to trade more than they would. There\u2019s lots of these developments happening all at once, and you put that together with having a really significant increase in the number of new investors in the market and there\u2019s a range of watch points there for us.\u201d Despite the concerns, Aldridge said Asic was heartened by the number of new retail investors pouring into the market. \u201cWe see it as a positive thing there are so many new investors \u2026 the most important thing is they are really focusing on investing in a way they understand and they\u2019re thinking about the longer term and not just trying to play the market.\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Why do only women seem to take the fall in Australia when scandal breaks? | Van Badham", "full_article": "On Wednesday Annette Kimmitt, chief executive of behemoth law firm MinterEllison, was asked to stand down from her position. Her sin was to criticise a senior parter of Australia\u2019s largest law firm who had provided advice to attorney general Christian Porter regarding the rape allegations recently made against him. Porter firmly denies the allegations.   Related: MinterEllison confirms chief executive's departure a week after sending email on Christian Porter    Kimmitt had sent an email to all MinterEllison staff last week, apologising that no \u201cconsultation or approval processes\u201d for the decision to assist Porter had been sought. The chief executive herself had only learned that someone from her own firm was representing Porter as a client when the attorney general gave a press conference to address the allegations. In that email to 2,000 staff, a surprised Kimmitt acknowledged that she\u2019d personally felt \u201ctriggered\u201d by these recent events. She extended an apology to those among the staff for whom \u201cthe nature of this matter\u201d was similarly painful. There are 2 million survivors of sexual violence in Australia, all of whom have had to endure watching weeks of cumulative allegations made against parliamentary staffers and now against Porter. With the percentage of survivorship that size, the chief executive of such a large organisation was exercising a basic duty of care by realising that there would be staff directly or indirectly incensed, distressed or retraumatised by the sudden news that their own firm was publicly standing with Porter. Especially given a context in which the Morrison government itself has fallen short in assuring survivors or the community around them that these issues are addressed with the seriousness they demand.  \u201cThe nature of this matter is clearly causing hurt to some of you, and it has certainly triggered hurt for me. I know that for many it may be a tough day, and I want to apologise for the pain you may be experiencing,\u201d was something that Morrison should have said to the nation when the rape allegations made by Brittany Higgins were first brought to public attention. Instead, this was the rational, reasonable and responsible response in Kimmitt\u2019s email that preceded the loss of her job. MinterEllison\u2019s board chairman, David O\u2019Brien, told Kimmitt her \u201cservices were no longer required\u201d on Tuesday. It was also reported that the MinterEllison partner now advising Porter \u201cwas thanked by the prime minister\u2019s office\u201d for doing so, and that he had \u201ctold his colleagues the federal government was one of their law firm\u2019s biggest clients.\u201d Kimmitt\u2019s exit provokes some other recent high-level removals from institutions of traditionally conservative influence to come to mind. Former CEO of Australia Post Christine Holgate was removed from an organisation with a heavily Liberal party-dominated board after the prime minister personally drove an investigation into her conduct. An independent report that Morrison received before Christmas last year was \u201ckept secret because not only did it completely exonerate Christine Holgate but showed that the remarks of the prime minister to the parliament were simply wrong.\u201d One also thinks of the National party\u2019s Bridget McKenzie, who was made to resign from her ministry for her role in the \u201csports rorts\u201d affair. How curious that after adverse legal findings costing billions of dollars were made against the government for the Stuart Robert/Alan Tudge-led robodebt disaster, both retain their cabinet positions. Or that Paul Fletcher overpaid $27m on a land acquisition and is also going nowhere. What does one say about Angus Taylor\u2019s involvement in scandals on water buybacks, critically endangered grasslands and a fake City of Sydney document beyond \u201cYes, he\u2019s still a minister.\u201d Morrison says he has not read the allegations made against Porter. He is adamant there will be no further investigation into them now that police say they have discontinued their inquiry. He has declared Porter an \u201cinnocent man\u201d. No longer a member of Morrison\u2019s government herself, former foreign minister Julie Bishop made the point: \u201cI think in order to deny allegations you would need to know the substance of the allegations or at least the detail of the allegations.\u201d   Related: Linda Reynolds extends sick leave amid ongoing controversy over Brittany Higgins    Meanwhile, some Coalition MPs speaking on the condition of anonymity have complained to journalists that Morrison\u2019s embattled defence minister Linda Reynolds \u201cis bearing the brunt of the criticism over the handling of Ms Higgins\u2019 case\u201d although \u201cother ministers and key government figures also knew about the rape allegations before the prime minister was told.\u201d Who, precisely, let it slip to the media that Reynolds had called Higgins a \u201clying cow\u201d? This is not to say the likes of Reynolds and McKenzie should not face consequences for their sins. It\u2019s just that there are rather a lot of sins going round, and yet consequences remain in uneven supply.

Twelve months ago the McGowan government would have expected to win a second term handily at the cost of a few seats. Instead, with a forecast swing of up to 12.5% to Labor, the government is expected to pick up seats and reduce the Liberal party\u2019s numbers in the lower house to low single digits. Liberal leader Zak Kirkup is likely to lose his seat of Dawesville. Polling conducted for the West Australian newspaper showed Labor candidate Lisa Munday sitting on 55% of the primary vote \u2013 a 10.7% swing toward Labor.   Related: Total wipeout or just a landslide: how bad will the 2021 WA election be for the Liberals?    The polling was conducted early this week before Kirkup on Thursday announced his intention to quit politics if he lost his seat, and held a disastrous press conference on his party\u2019s costings. The 34-year-old pinned much of his campaign as opposition leader on his lifelong ambition to be in politics \u2013 an ambition which could be over by 6pm. He would be the first WA Liberal leader to lose his seat in 88 years. The Liberal party has held Dawesville since it was created in 1994. As of Friday, 653,457 votes \u2013 499,226 pre-poll and 154,231 postal \u2013 had already been cast. That\u2019s 38% of total votes, the highest number of pre-poll votes in WA history. Despite a Labor win being clear for months before the writs were issued, much of the campaign has focused on Kirkup and internal issues within the Liberal party. \u201cIt has been pretty astonishing,\u201d says Prof John Phillimore, the executive director of the John Curtin Institute of Public Policy. \u201cFor an election that\u2019s been a foregone conclusion for a long time, it\u2019s been a pretty interesting campaign but probably not in the ways that people would expect. \u201cIt has largely revolved around the Liberal party, which is interesting because it\u2019s a pretty weak opposition. The government has just had to stand back and say \u2018we stand on our record\u2019, and watch the Liberal party explode.\u201d Kirkup\u2019s strategy to concede the election with three weeks to go appears to have backfired, Phillimore said. Any discussion of policy was then halted, \u201cbecause the only policy is: don\u2019t let them win by too much\u201d. Even that modest ambition may be unattainable: if polling holds true, the Liberal party stands to lose between five and 10 seats. If the swing predicted in Kirkup\u2019s seat is replicated statewide, the party could be reduced to just three seats, but Phillimore says it\u2019s likely some of the biggest swings would be in existing Labor seats, allowing the Liberal party to retain at least five. If the worst predictions come true for the Liberal party it could leave the National party as the senior coalition partner in WA, a never-before-seen phenomenon. The Nationals leader, Mia Davies, has been a stable figure for the past four years, during which time the Liberals have had three leaders. \u201cThe one thing Zak Kirkup\u2019s strategy has done is that it\u2019s lowered expectations so much that anything above eight [seats retained in the Legislative Assembly] will be thought of as not that bad,\u201d Phillimore said.   Related: WA election: Zak Kirkup hopes to save at least one piece of the Libs' furniture \u2013 his seat    The strategy of conceding early depended on the Liberal party being able to flip the torch and hold the government to account. Instead, moves like a renewable energy policy which appeared to take some conservative members of the Liberal party by surprise, and Kirkup announcing he would quit politics if he lost, \u201cmade it all about him\u201d, Phillimore said. \u201cIf the point was to keep the government honest and hold the government to account, then don\u2019t talk about yourself,\u201d he said. The downside for the public has been that the immensely popular McGowan government, which is set to increase its already significant majority in the lower house, has not faced the level of scrutiny it may otherwise have received. The one misstep was McGowan\u2019s suggestion the border checkpoints could stay up to keep methamphetamine out of the state. He swiftly backtracked, saying that what he actually meant was that airport checks used during the pandemic could be extended to check for drug importation, without requiring the tracking of travellers.

It is a book about the nature of human contact, about how we need one another in complex, raw, consuming ways. And, as will come as no surprise to fans of Morton\u2019s electrifying, moving debut, One Hundred Years of Dirt, it is a book steeped in a kind of candour and unabashed openness that is all too rare, inviting generosity, self-scrutiny and vulnerability of its readers.

Morton\u2019s journalism has marked him out as a writer of rare compassion and forensic curiosity, and across his memoirs he\u2019s applied that to questions of his own capacity and incapacity, and his 2019 diagnosis of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. The emotional abuse and absence of his father \u2013 so vividly recounted in One Hundred Years of Dirt \u2013 could not just be understood as a story of the failings of the past; it was a defining reality of Morton\u2019s adult life and one that required him to explore the nature of love and being loved, and the ways in which he needed to reassess his relationship with the world. For all it has stripped things away, causing loss and devastation and instability, Covid has given us an unprecedented (sorry) opportunity to think about how we live our lives. The books we read offer us insight into different ways of thinking, invite us to ask questions of ourselves and others. Part scientific enquiry, part social research, part memoir, My Year of Living Vulnerably is a book that speaks directly to the choices we might make after a period of physical, social, even cultural distancing from which we\u2019re only just slowly beginning to emerge. Morton\u2019s \u201cbig nerd project\u201d, as he puts it, canvasses questions of forgiveness and loneliness, masculinity and kindness, touch and doubt, and while intensely personal still gives us a jumping off point for what promises to be a wonderful chat next week.

Related: Polystyrene to be phased out next year under Australia's plastic waste plan    And the Waste Management and Resource Recovery Association of Australia, a leading industry body, has written to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, warning the government is likely to miss its packaging targets unless there are significant reforms. The government last week launched a national plastics plan that repeats a promise that all packaging used in Australia will be either reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. Under the government\u2019s approach, companies that produce and use packaging and have an annual turnover greater than $5m have two options. They can sign up to the Australian Packaging Covenant or choose to be regulated by states and territories under national laws introduced in 2011. But an independent review of the 2011 law, commissioned by the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment and published last month, found there were no reported compliance actions, investigations or complaints from states and territories in four years. \u201cThis does not indicate an absence of non-compliance from liable brand owners, but an absence of compliance and enforcement action by states and territories,\u201d the review said. The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) has more than 1,500 members, including major supermarkets and some of the world\u2019s biggest food and drinks brands, such as Nestle and Coca-Cola Amatil. The organisation told the review it had sent a list of 1,919 \u201cpotentially liable non-signatories\u201d to its covenant to states and territories.

The organisation\u2019s plastics campaigner, Katinka Day, said there needed to be penalties for companies that were not part of APCO. \u201cWe cannot feel confident that Australia\u2019s packaging targets will be met unless they are made mandatory to all companies putting packaging on the market,\u201d she said.

Waiting for parliament to resume, waiting for the Newspoll to drop. Opinion polls out early next week will provide the first public read on any political damage inflicted by the Brittany Higgins allegation and the historical allegation of rape against the attorney general, Christian Porter, which he denies. Waiting isn\u2019t new. Scott Morrison has been waiting for weeks \u2013 waiting to see if he can wait out the furore, waiting to see if the terrible wound that has opened in the parliamentary precinct (and beyond) during the past month will close over. Right in front of us, Australia\u2019s prime minister is waiting, and calculating.   Related: AFP didn't pass on documents detailing allegation against Christian Porter to NSW police    The prime minister hasn\u2019t taken me into his confidence about his various calculations, but having watched how he operates, I reckon I can have a stab at some of them. Before deciding, once and for all, whether Porter can remain as attorney general, and Linda Reynolds as defence minister, Morrison wants to assess the salience of federal parliament\u2019s #MeToo moment. Have voters logged the Higgins story, and the rape allegation levelled by a now-deceased woman against his attorney general? Do they have views about it? What are the views? Do men feel differently about these stories than women? Do women feel differently depending on their life experiences? Do privileged women feel differently about these stories than less privileged women? Can any of these differences help the government navigate the biggest political crisis they\u2019ve faced since the bushfires? Morrison thinks like a campaign director, and the mindset of the campaign director is simple: how can we swim across this rip? While Morrison has waited, he\u2019s engaged in mild weaponisation of the Porter issue by declaring the rule of law will crumble if the attorney general has to submit to a process to determine his fitness to remain in the cabinet. Morrison has framed this argument as a heroic point of principle. But the prime minister\u2019s argument is nonsense. It is absolute bollocks. Justin Gleeson, the former solicitor general, completely demolished Morrison\u2019s \u201crule of law\u201d defence this week as only a dedicated servant of the rule of law can. Read his piece if you haven\u2019t. In between bouts of mild weaponisation (I say mild, because if Morrison elects to really dig in, this will get much worse), we\u2019ve had flooding the zone \u2013 vaccine announcements that spun off in multiple directions. Half-price tickets to delightful tourist destinations in marginal seats complete with Morrison grinning for the cameras in a pilot\u2019s cap. Vaccinations are of course important. So is the economic recovery post-Covid. But given the gravity of the issues Morrison was fully intent on waiting out \u2013 given the fury and grief that had erupted around the country in the past few weeks \u2013 a prime minister grinning in a pilot\u2019s cap like he was fronting a Flight Centre advertisement felt like we\u2019d washed up in a political grotesquerie. The performance art read like an \u201cup yours\u201d that no one had asked for. It felt about as sonorous as nails dragging down a chalkboard. Right now, Morrison is projecting a significant empathy gap, and that is dangerous.  At no point has Morrison responded to these issues like a human being, or like an inclusive leader. He\u2019s responded like a politician in damage control. Calculation and calibration are no substitutes for empathy, and basic humanity. No doubt, voter views about these allegations are not homogenous. I\u2019m sure there will be a gender gap in the private polling being undertaken by the major parties, and I\u2019m sure women will see these stories slightly differently depending on their life experiences.   Related: News Corp Australia papers labelled 'sexist' and 'toxic' by former staff photographer at media inquiry     But I\u2019m also reasonably confident that projecting like a prime minister who doesn\u2019t get it, who isn\u2019t listening, who is intent on ensuring there remains one rule for the political class and another rule for the rest of the country, isn\u2019t a sound strategy. If one of the Liberal party\u2019s key swing constituencies is women over 35, who are hard to reachand necessary for electoral success, then looking empathic is pretty important. If you look like you don\u2019t care about Brittany Higgins, or you don\u2019t care about a rape allegation against your attorney general, then you prompt voters to ask: does this guy care about me? Does this bloke fathom the challenges I face in my life, or is he just another grasping political careerist? These are universal questions, whether you work part-time at Bunnings, or whether you are a partner in a law firm, and these are questions prime ministers don\u2019t want voters asking about them. If voters continue to ask these questions, if Labor gets some traction around probity and accountability in the parliament, if the question, \u201cwhat have you got to do to lose your job in this government?\u201d gets some currency, then Morrison, for all the current stonewalling, could turn on the head of a dime. Some people around the prime minister are already asking a simple question: is Porter really worth this pain? My question isn\u2019t about the prime minister\u2019s pain threshold. It\u2019s about the custodial responsibilities any prime minister should be prepared to exercise in office. My question is much the same as Gleeson\u2019s (although I\u2019m much less erudite). Gleeson framed his question to Morrison this way: \u201cIs the standard you set that you permit Porter to remain in the high office of attorney general with serious allegations of this kind hanging over him, when you have chosen not to have those allegations tested in a fair, independent inquiry that is available to you? If so, why?\u201d Why indeed. As well as the return of question time (minus Porter and minus Reynolds, and with Peter Dutton running tactics in the House) on Monday, women who really want things to be different, who are sick of the endless indignities and the weasel words and the bollocks, will march around the country.

Lawyers for Greensill this week told a London court that it had lent $5bn (\u00a33.6bn) to GFG to help fund the businesses, according to the Financial Times. In a letter sent on Friday to GFG\u2019s senior leadership and seen by the Guardian, Gupta said GFG had had \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d with Greensill\u2019s administrators. He said GFG hoped for a \u201cformal standstill agreement that would put on hold arrangements between the two parties and allow both sides more time to assess and negotiate next steps\u201d. This week, GFG hired investment bankers from PJT Partners, the restructuring advisers Alvarez &amp; Marsal and the law firm Norton Rose Fulbright to help in negotiations with the administrators. They are also advising on negotiations with an undisclosed number of potential lenders to inject more cash to the business. Gupta said he was \u201centhused by the amount of offers that we have received\u201d but added that \u201cgiven the scale of our operations this process will take some time to organise\u201d. Talks to secure longer-term financing could take several months to complete, said one source with knowledge of the situation. The timing of GFG\u2019s cash needs have not been disclosed, and it is thought that detailed knowledge of the Greensill loans is limited to a tight-knit circle around Gupta. Gupta told the heads of GFG\u2019s businesses that they should \u201ctake prudent steps to manage their cash positions carefully and reduce their call on group resources\u201d. His message also sought to portray the group as \u201cperforming well\u201d, but with \u201cspecific businesses \u2026 affected by either Covid-19, structural changes in their markets, or pressures on cash related to a rapid ramp up in demand.\u201d The UK business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has discussed the situation with executives at Liberty Steel, but the company is seeking private-sector funding. Unions representing the steel workers want the government to give assurances that it will step in to save production if a funding deal falls through. France\u2019s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said this week that his government would step in to protect jobs at GFG\u2019s French sites.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Boris Johnson could clash with backbenchers over coalmine", "full_article": "Boris Johnson is on a potential collision course with backbench MPs and local Conservative leaders amid a furious Tory response to the decision to put a hold on plans to create a controversial new coalmine in Cumbria. While environmental groups hailed the decision to call in the application for government consideration as long overdue, and Labour called for a longer-term plan for green jobs in the region, many Tories are dismayed at the uncertainty over a scheme its supporters say would create 500 jobs and support 2,000 more in supply chains.   Related: Cumbria mine: what will the public inquiry look at?    Mark Jenkinson, the MP for Workington in Cumbria \u2013 one of many traditionally Labour seats to change hands in the 2019 general election \u2013 said anger over the planned mine near Whitehaven \u201ccannot be understated\u201d. \u201cThis represents a complete reversal of the position taken just eight weeks ago, and a capitulation to climate alarmists,\u201d he said in a statement. Mike Starkie, the Conservative mayor of Copeland in Cumbria, said proper focus had not been placed on the fact that the mine was intended to produce coking coal for use in the steel industry. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need steel to drive forward the green agenda \u2013 if you\u2019re wanting to build windfarms, nuclear power stations, they all need steel,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cAnd the demand for coking coal is going to be there right through to 2050.\u201d In contrast, environmental groups said the decision by the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, to take responsibility for the scheme away from the local authority was obvious, particularly ahead of Glasgow hosting the pivotal Cop26 climate conference in November.     An artist\u2019s impression of the proposed deep coalmine in west Cumbria near Whitehaven Photograph: West Cumbria Mining Company    A new coalmine in Cumbria would \u201cdestroy the UK government\u2019s credibility\u201d ahead of the summit, Friends of the Earth climate campaigner Tony Bosworth said. International pressure on the government over the mine was ratcheted up earlier this week when John Kerry, the former US secretary of state who is now the county\u2019s climate change envoy, used a visit to London to praise the UK for phasing out coal use. Officials were refusing to say why Jenrick intervened, having declined to do so before, citing the fact that the calling of the planning application is a quasi-judicial process. A communities department source said Jenrick\u2019s decision was based largely on the need to consider new recommendations from the climate change committee, which advises the UK government, and on the fact that Cumbria county council had been unable to reach a clear decision about the project.   Related: Green jobs in Cumbria could far surpass posts in coalmine, report says    There will now be an inquiry led by the Planning Inspectorate, with Cumbria county council asked to provide information on how the mine would be consistent with \u201cmeeting the challenge of climate change, flooding and coastal change\u201d. The political ramifications remain fraught for Johnson, not least because the local MP for the proposed mine, Trudy Harrison, is his parliamentary private secretary, a role in which MPs act as an unpaid aide and backbench liaison lead for ministers. The Northern Research Group (NRG), a powerful lobby of about 50 backbench Tories, has not yet spoken out about Jenrick\u2019s decision, but is a strong supporter of the mine. In February, dozens of NRG MPs, alongside local Tories, condemned Labour\u2019s opposition to the plan. Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, argued on Friday that the mine would not create secure jobs and that the government was \u201cpeddling false solutions\u201d for the steel industry. Instead, he said, ministers should invest in efforts to help the steel industry decarbonise, delivering long-term jobs. The sentiment was not shared throughout Labour. Emma Williamson, a Labour councillor for Kells and Sandwith in Whitehaven, said she was \u201cabsolutely gutted\u201d at the decision and what it would mean for jobs and investment. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned that this is the end of the road for the mine,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned because my community needs these jobs and these investments, especially after the year we have had around Covid.\u201d Williamson said her community was fully behind the mine, not just for the prospect for investments and training, but also the sense of community it may bring, and the opportunities for young people. She said: \u201cI work really closely with a local group of ex-miners, and they\u2019ve often relayed such fond memories of the camaraderie that the mine brought to our community. It didn\u2019t just bring jobs and investment, but it also brought family together and community spirit. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so supportive of this, and we really need this lift.\u201d But Marianne Birkby, founder of Radiation Free Lakeland, which opposes the mine in part because of its proximity to the Sellafield nuclear waste site, said Jenrick\u2019s decision was \u201cfantastic news\u201d. \u201cArguably the greater and far more visceral threat from this mine is that it is close to Sellafield, and the mine would be directly underneath decades of radioactive waste,\u201d she said. Gerard Richardson, a local business owner, said that he found the decision \u201cridiculously frustrating\u201d. \u201cThis is an area that badly needs investment. This was a rare piece of genuine investment in west Cumbria and it could have been a starting point for so much more. It really is truthful to say that the majority of the campaigners are from outside of London.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "England trounce India in first T20 international \u2013 as it happened!", "full_article": "  5.33pm GMT       That\u2019s the end of a perfect day for England. They produced a proper team performance, to the extent that nobody failed, with the bat or the ball. Every bowler took a wicket apart from Sam Curran, who induced the mighty Rishabh Pant to duck his bouncer in a triumph of sorts. And all of the top four made at least 20, which is a lot more than the top order was managing in the Test series. For India, only Shreyas Iyer, who stroked the sole fifty of the match, can be satisfied with his evening\u2019s work. Thanks for your company and correspondence, and the OBO will be back at lunchtime on Sunday to see if India can turn the tables on England again.    Updated at 6.39pm GMT     5.21pm GMT       The player of the match is Jofra Archer, who finished with his best figures in T20 internationals, three for 23. He\u2019s holding a trophy that puts even his gold chain in the shade. \u201cWhen the competition\u2019s tough,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019ve gotta step up.\u201d He gives a glimpse of his thinking when he takes the new ball in T20. \u201cI\u2019d rather go for dot balls in the PowerPlay than wickets, but obviously wickets help the team.\u201d How\u2019s the Xbox going? \u201cGoing very good,\u201d he says with a big smile. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our own personal wifi box in our room, so everything\u2019s good.\u201d That is a relief.    Updated at 5.25pm GMT     5.15pm GMT       And here\u2019s Eoin Morgan. \u201cThe wicket was as expected,\u201d he says, perhaps mischievously. \u201cThe plans were very basic \u2013 hit a good length, straight \u2013 and we didn\u2019t have to go to plan B or C which is always a good sign.\u201d When Jason Roy scores runs, he adds, \u201cit really does gee the boys up.\u201d Asked about the change in England since the Tests, he doesn\u2019t think much of it: \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different form of the game.\u201d But he does warn that later in the series \u201cwe will be up against it\u201d.     Updated at 5.23pm GMT     5.10pm GMT       Here\u2019s Virat Kohli. \u201cWe just weren\u2019t aware enough of what we had to do on that kind of a pitch,\u201d he says. \u201cLack of execution on the shots we tried to play... The wicket probably didn\u2019t allow you as a batsman to hit the shots you wanted to,\u201d he adds, which is true, but also a bit rich coming from someone who said, just the other day, \u201cthe reason for our success as a team is that we\u2019ve never cribbed about the pitches\u201d. Then, to be fair, he holds his hand up: \u201cIt was just a below-par batting performance from us today and England made us pay for it.\u201d       5.03pm GMT       \u201cBetter than a slap in the face,\u201d says Jason Roy. Yes, he really said that. He\u2019s pleased with 49 but he gives most of the credit to the bowlers. \u201cTo come out and bowl and field like that was great.\u201d Asked about facing spin, which hasn\u2019t been his strong point lately, he mentions that he had a lot of practice against Adil Rashid in the nets, \u201cworking on my skills\u201d. He and Jos Buttler then pick up an award for (I think) the partnership of the match.       4.56pm GMT       \u201cCrowing is fair enough,\u201d says John Starbuck. Why do I feel there\u2019s a but coming? \u201cBut look what happened after the last time England beat India in the first match of the series. I suspect we\u2019ll need Moeen as well as Rashid next time.\u201d Yes, probably. It was a surprising pitch, offering only gentle turn, and the lavish bounce seemed to be on a fast bowler\u2019s length rather than doing anything for the spinners. It was payback time for the pink-ball Test: England got it right with their battalion of seamers, and India played one spinner too many \u2013 although the game was half-gone before they even bowled a ball.        4.51pm GMT       The next T20 World Cup, which should have taken place in Australia last autumn, is now down for India this autumn. Ahmedabad is one of the venues and England have put in some immaculate prep today. Jofra Archer was back to his immense best, fast and accurate, and Mark Wood was faster still. The whole bowling performance was reminiscent of England\u2019s very first T20, when they caught Australia cold and bombed them to bits. That paved the way for the 2005 Ashes win. This, alas, has come too late to help the Test team, but it had the same ferocity.       4.46pm GMT       Malan finishes on 24 not out, Bairstow on 26. England have four openers in this format and they all made at least 20 today, whereas India\u2019s innings was a lone hand from Shreyas Iyer. His classy 67 couldn\u2019t make up for the calamity suffered by India\u2019s top three, who made five between them. The decision to leave out Rohit Sharma could not have backfired more spectacularly.        4.43pm GMT    England win by eight wickets!    Dawid Malan lofts Sundar for six and England win with four and a half overs to spare. They have absolutely bossed this. It\u2019s been a wonderful performance and a terrible contest.     Dawid Malan and Jonny Bairstow celebrate victory. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters      Updated at 4.51pm GMT     4.40pm GMT       15th over: England 122-2 (Malan 17, Bairstow 25) Bairstow keeps calm enough to nudge Thakur for a single. He then calls Malan for a much quicker single, and would have run him out had Thakur\u2019s sharp throw hit the stumps. A couple more singles, and England need only two more.       4.36pm GMT       14th over: England 114-2 (Malan 15, Bairstow 22) Bairstow enjoyed that straight smear so much, he plays it again off Sundar, for four this time. And then there\u2019s a row, as Sundar appears to accuse Bairstow (at the non-striker\u2019s end) of obstructing the field. Malan had chipped the ball in his partner\u2019s direction, and Bairstow, turning away, headed it. His body language, always straightforward, says \u201cwhat else could I do?\u201d and the umpire seems to agree.       4.31pm GMT       13th over: England 107-2 (Malan 14, Bairstow 16) After getting his eye in with a single or two, Jonny B goes for it, giving Chahal the charge and chipping for six. Flicking the next ball, he almost gives Dhawan a catch at deep square. Riding his luck, he hits another six \u2013 that was halfway from a smack to a smear, straight back past the bowler. The camera finds Kohli, wincing: he knows this one has gone.  \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a super over, is there Tim?\u201d says Simon McMahon (5th over). No. \u201cBut if there is, have anything you like. Champagne. Whisky. Maybe even a bottle. Lager top if you\u2019re feeling really decadent?\u201d Too kind.       4.25pm GMT       12th over: England 92-2 (Malan 13, Bairstow 2) Jonny Bairstow plays a cut and gets off the mark, which is more than he did in most of his recent Test innings against India. Sundar gets a wicket for only three, but England need just 33 more, so a choke from here would be spectacular even by their standards.       4.22pm GMT    Wicket! Roy LBW b Sundar 49 (England 89-2)    Aha! On comes Washington Sundar, the off-spinner who did more batting than bowling in the Test series. Roy plays outside his first ball, and a review can\u2019t save him as it\u2019s umpire\u2019s call on whether it hit him outside the line. End of a punchy knock \u2013 49 off 32 balls, with three sixes.     Roy walks off after losing his wicket. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters      Updated at 4.32pm GMT     4.18pm GMT       11th over: England 89-1 (Roy 49, Malan 12) Today is Tom Curran\u2019s birthday, but Pandya seems to think it\u2019s Malan\u2019s. He presents him with another gift, shovelled round the corner for four more. England need 36 at exactly four an over. Everyone else needs some excitement.     Updated at 4.22pm GMT     4.13pm GMT       10th over: England 81-1 (Roy 47, Malan 7) Another false shot from Malan, who, like Kumar, is bringing some rust. At the halfway stage, with 44 more needed, even England will struggle to mess this one up. \u201cRoy and Buttler,\u201d wrote Alex Fleetwood before the wicket, \u201cseem to be doing a lot better against India\u2019s bowling attack than their Test counterparts... maybe they should be opening in Tests. Or did we try that already? Roy and Buttler have both opened the batting for England, but did they ever do it at the same time?\u201d No. Buttler has only ever done it twice, when quick runs were needed in the second innings: his average as a Test opener is 2.00, not that it means much. And Roy won\u2019t be doing it again in a hurry after flopping in the 2019 Ashes.    Updated at 4.14pm GMT     4.08pm GMT       9th over: England 77-1 (Roy 44, Malan 4) Hardik Pandya comes on with his non-military medium. Malan misses one freebie, bottom-edging a cut, before accepting another, helping a short ball round the corner. Only five off the over, but even that is above the required rate. India, like the late great Leonard Cohen, are waiting for a miracle.       4.05pm GMT       8th over: England 72-1 (Roy 44, Malan 0) Roy can be shaky against spin, but not today. He picks Chahal\u2019s googly, swinging it for four, and then he slog-sweeps for another six. England are playing as if they have a reservation for dinner \u2013 but Chahal finds a wicket, so maybe this can still get interesting.       4.03pm GMT    Wicket! Buttler LBW b Chahal 28 (England 72-1)    The breakthrough! Chahal\u2019s leg-break lands on middle and would have hit it too, had Buttler\u2019s pad not got in the way. He sets off without bothering to review. That\u2019s a big scalp, but India need about three more of them. And here comes the world\u2019s top-rated batsman in T20 internationals.     Pant successfully appeals for the LBW wicket of Buttler. Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 4.07pm GMT     3.59pm GMT       7th over: England 58-0 (Roy 31, Buttler 27) Roy\u2019s not having this: he gives Axar the heave-ho, slog-sweeping for six. England only need five an over now.       3.55pm GMT       6th over: England 50-0 (Roy 24, Buttler 26) Kumar to Buttler, which should be rust at both ends \u2013 one just back from injury, the other from a three-Test rest. Kumar does seem short of rhythm, drifting onto the pads; Buttler doesn\u2019t, helping himself from the hotel buffet. He takes two twos and a four, all on the leg side, and nips past Roy in the race for second place on the day. That\u2019s the PowerPlay done, and it\u2019s all been strangely one-sided. Come on India!    Updated at 3.56pm GMT     3.49pm GMT       5th over: England 42-0 (Roy 24, Buttler 18) It\u2019s time, Kohli feels, for a second spell from Axar. Buttler swings him for \u2013 two, as KL Rahul manages to prevents by shoving the ball back over the rope before he plants his feet. Clever stuff. Then there\u2019s a review for LBW, Axar\u2019s middle name, but Buttler was well forward and the ball struck him outside the line. Buttler responds by cutting for four and then dancing down the track and on-driving for six. Why couldn\u2019t England do this to Axar in the Tests?  \u201cAh,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma, \u201cit\u2019s all looking a bit too dreadful for the Indians, isn\u2019t it? If it\u2019s any consolation, there\u2019s four of these things left \u2013 England could very well forget how to play cricket by the time we\u2019re done with this series.\u201d     Jos Buttler drives the ball. Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 3.56pm GMT     3.43pm GMT       4th over: England 29-0 (Roy 24, Buttler 5) Kohli, trying everything, replaces Kumar with Shardul Thakur. Buttler glides past backward point for two, then gets in a tangle trying a ramp and edging into his own thigh. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good pitch to bat on,\u201d says Stuart Broad, whereupon Roy slams a length ball back past the bowler for four. He already has the second-highest score of the match.       3.38pm GMT       3rd over: England 21-0 (Roy 19, Buttler 2) But it will be one spinner replacing another, as Axar hands over to the leg-spin of Yuzvendra Chahal. Roy greets him rather rudely with a six over midwicket, and then gets a fortunate four as a square drive spins past the man at backward point. To cap it all, there\u2019s a Harrow cut for a single. India\u2019s score at this stage, a caption informs us, was 7 for 2.     Jason Roy drives the ball. Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 3.57pm GMT     3.34pm GMT       2nd over: England 10-0 (Roy 8, Buttler 2) It won\u2019t be spin \u2013 it\u2019s Bhuvi Kumar, back from injury. He almost gets a wicket first ball, as Roy mis-hits a chip and picks up a jammy two. Then Roy gets his eye in, swinging over square leg for four. Seven off the over, which is no more than England need.       3.30pm GMT       1st over: England 3-0 (Roy 1, Buttler 2) No turn for the demon Axar, so Roy nurdles a single and Buttler clips for two, both to midwicket. Will it spin be from both ends?     Updated at 3.31pm GMT     3.27pm GMT       It\u2019s going to be Axar Patel. The PA misses a trick by not playing some horror-movie music.       3.16pm GMT    India finish on 124    20th over: India 124-7 (Sundar 3, Patel 7) Morgan still had a bit of Rashid up his sleeve as the final over approached. He\u2019s brave, but not that brave, so it\u2019s Jordan, England\u2019s regular death bowler. His slower balls do the trick before a quicker one is thwacked for four to third man by Axar Patel. And that\u2019s the end of a stop-start innings and a delicious display in the field from England. \u201cA near-perfect bowling performance,\u201d says Nasser Hussain. India put on a one-man show by Shreyas Iyer, whereas England staged an ensemble piece with every bowler (and fielder) doing his bit and Jofra Archer merely first among equals.

Sam keeps it tight otherwise. He\u2019s effectively auditioning for his brother\u2019s role here, so I hope he\u2019s got him a nice birthday present. \u201cNever watched T20 before,\u201d says Karen Brigden. \u201cIt\u2019s the espresso-addled toddler of the cricket family and I am loving it!\u201d       3.02pm GMT       18th over: India 105-6 (Iyer 58, Sundar 1) Archer doesn\u2019t get the hat-trick as his bouncer to Washington Sundar is called a wide, but this over shows again that he is the master of white-ball fast bowling. He finishes with three for 23.  \u201cBreathless stuff here,\u201d says Brian Withington. \u201cI hardly dare lift eyes from screen to type!

End of an excellent partnership: England needed that.       2.54pm GMT       17th over: India 102-4 (Iyer 57, Pandya 19) Jordan replaces Stokes and Iyer takes a single to reach fifty off 36 balls. He\u2019s shown how to bat on this bouncy surface: use the pace, find the gap, ride your luck. He celebrates with his first big shot, an upper cut for six. India have a hundred and a fighting chance.     Iyer celebrates reaching his half century. Photograph: Danish Siddiqui/Reuters      Updated at 3.18pm GMT     2.49pm GMT       16th over: India 92-4 (Iyer 49, Pandya 17) Back comes Archer, and the force is no longer with him. His first ball is on the pads and clipped for four by Iyer, who then eases the next one through backward point. That\u2019s 20 off the past nine balls. Archer digs deep and produces three dots off the last four balls. Good contest! A tweet from Andy Zaltzman. \u201cIndia\u2019s 22-3 is their second lowest score in a T20 powerplay, and lowest when batting first. Also the joint lowest powerplay score by a team against England in T20s (Afghanistan were 22-5, batting 2nd, in Colombo in 2012 ICC World T20).\u201d So they were Afghanistan in disguise.       2.44pm GMT       15th over: India 83-4 (Iyer 40, Pandya 17) After pootling along to seven off 12 balls, Pandya goes for it, practises his golf and swings Stokes for six. Expecting a bouncer, he deflects it off his chin for four. That\u2019s superb batting, and at last the complexion of the game changes.     Updated at 2.45pm GMT     2.40pm GMT       14th over: India 71-4 (Iyer 39, Pandya 6) Wood stays on to complete his quota.

That is eight off the over, so India need to keep it up.        2.35pm GMT       13th over: India 63-4 (Iyer 34, Pandya 3) Chris Jordan is back, making you wonder how Morgan keeps track. And even Jordan is making chin music, smacking Pandya on the hand, like a Victorian teacher. Five off the over, which has been par so far. The big question is whether India can go to eight or nine for the final third of their innings.        2.30pm GMT       12th over: India 58-4 (Iyer 31, Pandya 1) Yet another change as Stokes gives way to Wood. He has a slip, and rightly so. He bowls a snorter to Pandya, climbing from back-of-a-length and ending up in front of Jos Buttler\u2019s eyes. Great stuff from Wood, who has one for 12 from three overs. Here\u2019s Julia on Twitter, quoting me back at myself. \u201c\u2018The openers treat Rashid with respect.

Iyer plays a beautiful stroke, an inside-out drive, beating Malan at deep extra: that\u2019s the textbook shot of the day, while Pant gets the prize for improv.       2.21pm GMT       10th over: India 48-4 (Iyer 22, Pandya 0) So that\u2019s the half-way stage and India are in some trouble. Are they, to paraphrase Iggy Pop, deeper than the s*** they\u2019re in? We will see. Hardik Pandya\u2019s a handy guy to have around for the last ten overs, and Iyer has been quietly effective.

He\u2019s got a new hairstyle, choppy rather than floppy, but he still has the unstoppable air of a cartoon mouse. His pace is officially known as waspish, and he even persuades Pant to duck a bouncer. Curran switches to round the wicket for the right-handed Iyer and curses himself as a freebie on the pads brings another leg glance for four. These two have already doubled the score.       2.10pm GMT       8th over: India 34-3 (Pant 19, Iyer 10) Eoin Morgan is ringing the changes and now he turns to Ben Stokes, who concedes five singles. That means Sam Curran will be the fifth seamer. It could be worse: he could be his brother Tom, who has been dropped on his 25th birthday. Eoin Morgan has many qualities, but a soft heart isn\u2019t one of them.    Updated at 2.11pm GMT     2.05pm GMT       7th over: India 29-3 (Pant 17, Iyer 7) Shreyas Iyer, facing Wood, gets a tickle on another super-quick ball and picks up four. That\u2019s the first boundary not scored by Pant, who has been on a different plane from his team-mates. \u201cLooks a little bit uneven, this pitch,\u201d says Stuart Broad on commentary. He\u2019s in Wimbledon, WFH. He\u2019ll be doing the OBO next.      Rishabh Pant in action.

India manage to get through a whole over, but their top three have had a shocker here: together they made 5 for 3 off 21 balls.       1.57pm GMT       5th over: India 20-3 (Pant 15, Iyer 0) Rashid had come off, as he had to if Morgan was to have any options in the middle overs. On came Wood, and he touched 94mph with his third ball, whereas Archer was dawdling along at 90. Great stuff from both of them, and from Morgan. \u201cA decent start for England,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cSocially distanced, outdoor drinks on me if there\u2019s a super over.\u201d    Updated at 1.58pm GMT     1.56pm GMT    Wicket!!

Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 2.04pm GMT     1.51pm GMT       4th over: India 18-2 (Dhawan 3, Pant 14) A single for Dhawan, the first run Archer has conceded. And then Pant pulls out the reverse, and it\u2019s a six! Ramped over the keeper. \u201cJimmy Anderson is smirking somewhere,\u201d says Nasser Hussain. Pant follows up with a leg glance for four, the right way round. Game on.       1.46pm GMT       3rd over: India 7-2 (Dhawan 2, Pant 4) A boundary at last, as Rishabh Pant comes in and cuts Rashid for four as if there\u2019s nothing amiss. But England are on top: their WinViz rating, 42 per cent at the start, has shot up to 62.     Updated at 1.47pm GMT     1.44pm GMT    WICKET!! Kohli c Jordan b Rashid 0 (India 3-2)    Kohli\u2019s gone too! Another step away, another mow, connecting this time but going straight to Chris Jordan at mid-off. That\u2019s a goal for Rashid and an assist for Archer, who rattled Kohli\u2019s hand and dented his pride. Oh India. Are you England in disguise?     Kohli walks off after being dismissed for 0 by Rashid. Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 1.48pm GMT     1.41pm GMT       2nd over: India 2-1 (Dhawan 1, Kohli 0) Archer finds some bounce and raps Kohli on the glove. Kohli tries to answer back by stepping away to leg and having a mow, but he misses it. That\u2019s a wicket maiden and a dream start for England\u2019s gun bowler.     Updated at 1.42pm GMT     1.38pm GMT    Wicket!! Rahul b Archer 1 (India 2-1)    Jofra Archer strikes with his second ball! It\u2019s a wide half-volley, but quick enough for KL Rahul to be late on it and perhaps jagging back, as he drags it on. First blood to England.     Archer celebrates with Stokes after taking the wicket of Rahul. Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 1.44pm GMT     1.35pm GMT       1st over: India 2-0 (Dhawan 1, Rahul 1) Rashid, who hasn\u2019t bowled since December, does well to begin with two dots to the left-handed Dhawan. Then he drags one down, but gets away with it as Dhawan\u2019s pull goes to the man at deep square. A single to Rahul too as the openers treat Rashid with respect. What do they think this is, a Test match?     Updated at 1.35pm GMT     1.31pm GMT    Surprise!    The first over will be bowled by ... Adil Rashid.       1.13pm GMT    India XI: lashings of spin, no Rohit    India see England\u2019s one spinner and raise them. Twice over. There\u2019s no Ashwin, but Axar Patel is back for more, so is Washington Sundar, and neither of them is the spin king in this squad \u2013 that\u2019s Yuzvendra Chahal. So the two captains seem to have read the pitch quite differently. And the last time that happened on this ground, England took a hammering. The good news for England is: no sign of Rohit Sharma, the batsman of the Test series, although the pundits are confused as they thought he was one of the names Kohli reeled off just now. India 1 Rahul, 2 Dhawan, 3 Kohli (capt), 4 Iyer, 5 Pant (wkt), 6 H Pandya, 7 Axar, 8 Sundar, 9 Kumar, 10 Thakur, 11 Chahal.    Updated at 1.14pm GMT     1.06pm GMT    England XI: pace not spin    England bring in Mark Wood, and Jofra Archer has recovered from his bad elbow, so there\u2019s plenty of pace. But no Moeen Ali, and not even a part-time spinner to be Rashid\u2019s wingman. Will they regret that? England 1 Roy, 2 Buttler (wkt), 3 Malan, 4 Bairstow, 5 Stokes, 6 Morgan (capt), 7 Sam Curran, 8 Jordan, 9 Wood, 10 Archer, 11 Rashid.    Updated at 1.29pm GMT     1.03pm GMT       \u201cProbably would have bowled first as well,\u201d says Virat Kohli, candidly.       1.01pm GMT    Toss: England win and bowl first    Eoin Morgan calls heads, heads it is, and he elects to chase. \u201cThe wicket looks really good. The last couple of nights, there\u2019s been a bit of dew around.\u201d     All fired up; Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler make their way out alongside Virat Kohli and KL Rahul. Photograph: Surjeet Yadav/Getty Images      Updated at 2.26pm GMT     1.00pm GMT       While we wait for the toss, Yash Gupta has a cunning plan. \u201cIf England rather than giving India a thumping in first match and then losing series 4-1, manage to lose first match by a handsome margin, I can see their chances of clinching a series. After all, they would want to avoid the pitch going Hallelujah again once they gain an upper hand in the series, and I guess THEY WILL DO WELL TO REMEMBER IT (whispering in Professor McGonagall\u2019s voice).\u201d        11.33am GMT    Preamble: battle of the top dogs    Afternoon everyone. Once more unto the crease, dear friends, once more unto the Ahmedabad colosseum. But this time it\u2019s a different ballgame. The clothes are coloured, the ball is white, the timing is congenial for anyone in the West. And the scales are beautifully balanced. This is a shoot-out between the world\u2019s two best teams in T20 internationals. England are top of the ICC rankings, India second. Both of them have four wins in their last five T20 matches, but India have four in their last five against England. They also have home advantage (even a crowd) and our old friend Mo Mentum, who changed sides rather abruptly a month ago.  Yesterday Virat Kohli and Eoin Morgan were both busy claiming to be the underdogs. If they were in England, Kohli would be right. As it is, the most likely result, according to Oddschecker, is 3-2 to India. For all Morgan\u2019s mastery, England will be doing well if they avoid a 4-1 defeat \u2013 which is what India need to topple them from their perch. The big question for England\u2019s big-hitters is this: how long will it take them to make a mockery of their Test brethren? (Some of whom are the same people.) In their catalogue of capitulation, England scraped 134, 164, 112, 81, 205 and 135. That gave them a team average of 138, which is fewer than they scored in 11 of their last 12 T20s (and the 12th, at Old Trafford, was ruined by rain). In those 12 T20s, they were never once all out. It\u2019s quite an achievement to score more runs when you have only 20 overs to play with, as opposed to all the time in the world. They might even have won the Test series if only they\u2019d handled the pink ball differently and gone hell for lacquer. Will Axar Patel be back to torment them again? Probably only if it\u2019s another turning pitch \u2013 in which case Adil Rashid should be able to give India a dose of their own medicine. His fellow leggie, Yuzvendra Chahal, will be licking his lips too. It\u2019s all mouth-watering. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m just going to nip out for a vaccination. See you after 1pm GMT for the toss and the teams.

Two teachers and a pupil have spoken about their first week back at school.  \u2018It would be better if we had blended learning\u2019      As pupils return to primary school after weeks of online learning, they bring with them \u201ca different kind of stress\u201d said Louise Neve, 51, a teacher in Hampshire. This week she has been frustrated by the safety guidance for junior schools as social distancing is largely unrealistic for younger classes. Her \u201cbubble\u201d of 28 pupils, aged eight and nine, are provided with hand gel and the classroom windows are opened an inch or two. \u201cCovid is now known to be airborne rather than mostly transmitted on surfaces,\u201d said Neve. \u201cIt would be much better if we had blended learning, with smaller classes and children coming in on a rota.\u201d Neve, who is clinically vulnerable with several health conditions including asthma, was only recently vaccinated, \u201cso it hasn\u2019t kicked in yet\u201d. She is worried about catching Covid from her pupils or passing the virus on to her 16-year-old daughter, who has a chronic post-viral condition. \u201cIf I were to pick it up from one of the asymptomatic children, I could then take it home to her,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as simple as saying the children don\u2019t get ill: there\u2019s a bigger picture that nobody at the top level seems to be looking at.\u201d The mood among teachers is mixed, she said. \u201cTo those who are vulnerable, it\u2019s more of a worry because we\u2019re in contact with larger numbers of children. But it\u2019s a smaller workload than when teaching online.\u201d \u2018I imagined there would be more whispering with the masks on\u2019 Joanne Humphrey, 50, head of English at a secondary school in Oxfordshire, also has \u201cmixed feelings\u201d about returning to the classroom.

I don\u2019t want to ask students to repeat themselves four times, because eventually they\u2019ll give up and stop putting their hand up out of embarrassment.\u201d To Humphrey\u2019s surprise, however, most of her students, who are in class sizes of 15 to 24, have complied with the new rule. \u201cMotivating and controlling the class hasn\u2019t been as bad as I thought. I imagined there would be more mischief and whispering with the masks on.

There\u2019s a sense of community you just don\u2019t get with online teaching.\u201d Ahmed, who is studying biology, chemistry and 3D design at A-level and is hoping to become a dentist, said he had enjoyed seeing his friends but sometimes found wearing a mask all day difficult. \u201cThey can sometimes make it hard to concentrate and by the end of the day it feels like you can\u2019t breathe. \u201cIt\u2019s also nearly impossible to social distance with 30 people in a class. It makes me laugh when you watch the news and they show a small group spaced out in a room \u2013 that\u2019s not what it\u2019s like.\u201d Ahmed said Covid testing at his school of 1,100 pupils had gone quite well so far. Lessons were cancelled on Monday and students were asked to come in, with time slots provided for each form group of about 20 to 30 students, with six to eight booths in the hall for them to use. \u201cI think it\u2019s OK because we can do it ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s privacy to do your test but two people share a booth.\u201d We had to provide our mobile number at the start so once you\u2019re finished you leave the hall and your result is texted to you.\u201d As an A-level student, Ahmed is worried about exams especially after falling behind in November when he got Covid from school. \u201cWe\u2019re not having traditional exams but we\u2019re still having smaller ones.

Gone were the demons experienced on the same ground during the recent 3-1 defeat in the Test matches, England\u2019s batsmen knocking off their target with 27 balls to spare after Archer\u2019s earlier three for 23 had reduced the hosts to 124 for seven.   Related: England beat India by eight wickets in first T20 international \u2013 live reaction!    For Jonny Bairstow there was a pleasing return to the scene of the three ducks in four innings that followed his much-debated mid-tour break, clubbing an unbeaten 26 from 17 balls, while Dawid Malan\u2019s first outing on the subcontinent saw him seal the win with a handsome straight six off Washington Sundar to finish 24 not out from 20. Jason Roy had earlier broken the back of the chase with a 32-ball 49, ending what has been a personally fallow 12-month period in international cricket for the opener. This was timely too, given some recent (albeit mixed) messages from England about the in-form Alex Hales possibly ending a near two-year exile from the set-up. But as good as the batsmen were \u2013 and this was not a straightforward surface for the first of five matches at the Narendra Modi stadium \u2013 the 1-0 lead for Eoin Morgan\u2019s players was set up by a performance in the field that belied a lack of warmup cricket for the majority, and highlighted the centrality of Archer to their T20 World Cup plans. \u201cI\u2019m just glad to help,\u201d said Archer, fresh from his best figures in T20i cricket and having shown few signs of the elbow injury that affected his Test campaign. \u201cWhen the competition is tough you step up \u2013 and competition brings out the best in me.\u201d Morgan had said before the match that bowlers are still playing catch-up in T20 as the skills of batsmen continue to expand. But here, after winning the toss, his attack was clinical, wiping out India\u2019s top three and sending down 25 dot balls in an opening powerplay of just 22 runs that left the hosts immediately up against it. This was produced through a heady mix of leg-spin and outright pace. Archer struck with his second ball as KL Rahul chopped on and Adil Rashid, the solitary spinner and entrusted with the first over, snared Virat Kohli for a fifth-ball duck as he attempted to give himself room, only to slap one to the safe hands of Chris Jordan at mid-off. The 67,000-strong crowd was stunned into silence by the departure of the Indian captain and though Rishabh Pant soon broke this with a frankly outrageous scooped six off Archer, the hush returned when Mark Wood lit up Shikhar Dhawan\u2019s bails during the first of four fiery overs that continued Archer\u2019s initial hostility. India were badly in need of a partnership and though Shreyas Iyer batted through from No 5 to the final over \u2013 eventually falling to a Jordan slower ball for a 48-ball 67 made through classical strokeplay and one cut six over backward point \u2013 England held a solid length on the two-paced pitch and struck at regular intervals to stymie any momentum. Key to this was the removal of the dangerous Pant in the 10th over. He may have bettered the trick shot witnessed off Jimmy Anderson during the fourth Test but the left-hander was successfully suppressed thereafter, eventually flicking the golden arm of Ben Stokes to Bairstow in the deep to see India 48 for four by the halfway stage. It left Hardik Pandya as the only recognised hitter left alongside Iyer but when Archer returned for a second spell and claimed two in two balls \u2013 Pandya chipping to mid-off for a 21-ball 19 and Shardul Thakur pulling the fast bowler to long leg \u2013 England\u2019s batsmen knew their looming chase would likely be manageable.

It meant that when Roy eventually perished, lbw to Sundar after Buttler had been similarly trapped by leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal for 28, a mere 35 runs were required from 8.5 overs.  Out strode Bairstow bristling with intent, pumping two sixes and standing his ground when he and Sundar collided at the non-striker\u2019s end to see a return catch off Malan go down.

Eddie Jones\u2019s side are seeking to avoid a third defeat in four Six Nations matches and a first home loss to France in the championship since 2005 and are only too aware that they must improve their discipline to do so. They have shipped 41 penalties in their three matches so far and their tally of 14 against Wales last time out ultimately proved pivotal.

England, for their part, have kept their counsel this week when asked about the needle associated with le crunch \u2013 no doubt aware their discipline will be under the spotlight \u2013 with Jones bristling at the line of questioning and Mako Vunipola simply insisting his side will \u201cunsettle them on the ball\u201d.

You still have to be going for it and pushing the limits all the time, but just with the understanding that discipline is so key. Hopefully we\u2019ll get on the right side of that. \u201cI know [discipline] has been bit of a problem for us for a little while but we\u2019ve been genuinely addressing it. I can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I\u2019m hoping we\u2019re much more disciplined at the weekend. Penalties give teams massive ins into the team and pile the pressure on, so we understand that important that is. But it\u2019s coupled with our intent to attack the game.\u201d The irony of England\u2019s defeat by Wales is that discipline developed into a problem they ultimately could not overcome, just as they were getting on top of their previous No 1 issue, their attacking fluency \u2013 or lack thereof. In Cardiff England produced some of their finest attacking rugby since the 2019 World Cup and the hope is that Max Malins can add to that on the full-back\u2019s first England start. \u201cAs the tournament has progressed we\u2019ve got better,\u201d added Slade. \u201cThe performance against Scotland was nowhere near where we wanted to be. After that game we had a lot of honest conversations and people said what they wanted to say. We clarified a lot of things and we\u2019ve definitely made a bit of a mindset shift. \u201cSometimes our first option was to kick rather than to run and we\u2019ve definitely shifted in the right direction in terms of having a more balanced game and wanting to take people on and run. We\u2019ve got a lot of talented individuals in this team, talented ball carriers up front, people with exciting footwork and pace out wide. \u201cWe told ourselves to get genuinely excited about the opportunities we can put ourselves in to take people on. I don\u2019t think the scoreline against Wales reflected how the game went. We are definitely looking to go as hard as we can these next week and put a smile back on people\u2019s faces.

Mallard was interested in ends rather than means and pioneered several different forms of imaging technology, adopting another technique each time it offered the chance to produce clearer images or greater safety for the patient. In the beginning, locating tumours or other pathology involved injecting radioactive tracers and picking up their emissions with detectors outside the body. Scientists in the US developed the principle of tomography (essentially 3D imaging) in 1964, rotating detectors around the body to build an image in successive slices \u2013 a process that Mallard likened to the slivers that emerged from the bacon slicer in his father\u2019s shop. From 1967 to 1969, he led the development of the Aberdeen Section Scanner, a machine that used this principle to detect gamma rays emitted by injected radioisotopes and produce a digital output that could guide radiotherapy in cancer treatment. In 1964 Mallard had shown that there were differences between normal and tumour tissues in intrinsic signals known as electron spin resonance, and predicted that a scanner based on that principle would be able to \u201csee\u201d tumours without having to inject any radioactivity. No one paid any attention to his paper in the journal Nature, but a few years later scientists in the US made the first research breakthroughs with MRI. Immediately grasping its potential, Mallard hired Jim Hutchison and Bill Edelstein to explore this new approach, which involved detecting the impact of a strong magnetic field on the hydrogen nuclei of the water molecules in living tissue. As soon as they produced their first successful image of a mouse, Mallard set about raising the funds to build a scanner that could take a human patient. Equipped with the first electromagnet produced by the then fledgling company Oxford Instruments, and using standard copper tubing and second-hand parts, the \u201chomemade\u201d scanner initially encountered a problem with the movement caused by heartbeats, which blurred the image. Hutchison and Edelstein solved this problem, a discovery that Mallard called \u201cthe real breakthrough\u201d for MRI. Meanwhile the biologist on the team, Meg Foster, developed a greater understanding of the differences in MRI signals between normal and diseased tissue. In August 1980, the team\u2019s Mark 1 scanner successfully imaged a cancer patient and revealed previously undiagnosed tumours. The Aberdeen group\u2019s patents on refinements to MRI technology later earned millions in royalties for the university, as commercial manufacturers began to produce scanners for hospitals around the world. Mallard was born in Kingsthorpe, a suburb of Northampton. His father, also John, ran a grocer\u2019s shop, supported by his wife, Margaret (nee Huckle). John was their only child, and from early childhood was, in his own words, \u201cseriously handicapped by deafness\u201d. In spite of this he won a scholarship to attend Northampton Town and County grammar school. A further borough scholarship took him to the University of Nottingham to study physics. He stayed at Nottingham for a PhD on the magnetic properties of uranium. In 1951 he began his first job, as a hospital physicist at the Liverpool Radium Institute, where he learned how to inject patients with radioactive iodine and move a Geiger counter across the neck to produce an image of the thyroid gland. In 1953 he moved to become a senior physicist and later head of department at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, then based at Hammersmith hospital, in west London. There he built an automatic scanner to detect emissions from injected radioisotopes and print the results, a machine that could reveal brain tumours with an accuracy of 80%. At Hammersmith hospital he met Fiona Lawrance, who was working as a medical secretary, and they were married in 1958. They had two children, John and Katriona. In 1965 the family moved over 500 miles north when Mallard took up the new chair in medical physics at the University of Aberdeen \u2013 coincidentally it was Fiona\u2019s home town. While there he campaigned to raise the funds to open a PET (positron emission tomography) facility, which eventually opened in the early 1980s. David Lurie, now professor of biomedical physics at Aberdeen, joined Mallard\u2019s MRI group in 1983. Acknowledging the communication difficulties caused by his \u201cold school\u201d boss\u2019s profound hearing loss, he says Mallard often issued directions to his staff in the form of hand-written memos. \u201cOne of his real talents was realising what would become important and putting teams together to investigate these things,\u201d he said, adding that Mallard was fundamentally kind, and delighted when his suggestions proved fruitful. Mallard retired in 1992, when he was also made OBE. He continued to give talks and write review papers, and devoted his leisure time to gardening, music, opera and ballet, and making jewellery. Though the Aberdeen team was not recognised in the 2003 Nobel prize for the development of MRI, Mallard received numerous other honours, including the Royal Society Wellcome prize and gold medal, the Royal Medal of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and the freedoms of the city of Aberdeen and of his birthplace, Northampton. The John Mallard Scottish PET Centre, a purpose-built successor to the one he first established in the 80s, was opened in 1998. Fiona died in 2020. John is survived by their children and four grandchildren. \u2022 John Mallard, medical physicist, born 14 January 1927; died 25 February 2021", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Chris Wilder likely to leave Sheffield United, Premier League team news and more - as it happened", "full_article": "  5.55pm GMT       Right, thanks for reading and all the comments.

The Mexican has been absent since a sickening clash of heads with Arsenal defender David Luiz in November. The Molineux manager said Jimenez\u2019s return and positive outlook on the injury has lifted spirits in the Wolves camp.  It\u2019s a protective headgear that he uses during the training sessions, something that prevents any kind of contact on the skull. He\u2019s not decided yet if he\u2019s going to wear it when he returns to competitions but now it\u2019s a better approach for him to be more involved inside of the training sessions. He\u2019s doing quite well and he\u2019s improving. We still have to wait but it\u2019s not decided yet whether he\u2019s going to wear it in the future. First we have to put him back in the pitch in the best and safest way to do it. It\u2019s a big lift because he\u2019s a fantastic boy. With the serious situation he\u2019s faced and the doubts, it was clear that he never doubted, he was always positive, he\u2019s always with a smile, he\u2019s always engaged to do things. That, by itself, is a big, big lift when you see someone with something so serious and he\u2019s so positive about it all. Raul is amazing.

Brighton are only above third-bottom Fulham on goal difference and the Cottagers have greater momentum in the battle to stay up. Potter says Brighton just need to keep the faith.  I think you\u2019ve got to deal with the results because clearly they\u2019re important, you have to deal with them and then you have to look at the performance and how you can use the performance to turn those results into positive ones, that\u2019s where the work is and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do. Of course we\u2019re frustrated because we\u2019d like to have a better points tally but it is what it is. We know we\u2019re in the situation we\u2019re in, we know we have to fight for the points, we know we have to fight for the results and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. There\u2019s 11 games to go, a lot of points to play for and a lot of football to play but every game is a massive opportunity to try and get something and we\u2019ll go and do our best against a really good opponent.  Brighton are again without Tariq Lamptey and Potter says the youngster will now need surgery on his troublesome hamstring problem.   We just have to focus on getting him fit and strong and ready for the start of next season. It\u2019s a big blow for him, but we\u2019ve sort of got used to him not being available because he hasn\u2019t been available for a while, but still it\u2019s disappointing for us of course.     Updated at 3.49pm GMT     3.30pm GMT       Who wants some hard-hitting Opta stats and numbers for the weekend? (This section of the blog is sponsored by Kraftwerk)           Numbers     Arsenal are winless in their last five meetings with Tottenham in all competitions (D2 L3) \u2013 they\u2019ve never gone six without a win against their north London rivals before.  Leicester have won a league-low 36% of their Premier League points in home games this season (19/53). Only Crystal Palace in 1997-98 (33%) have ever won fewer than 36% of their points in a Premier League season at home.  Manchester United are looking to keep four consecutive league clean sheets under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for the first time, last doing so in January 2018 under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.  Liverpool have scored with just two of their last 67 shots in open play in the Premier League, with these efforts at goal seeing an xG value of 6.7, meaning Liverpool would have been expected to score almost seven goals.        3.21pm GMT       Southampton boss Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl isn\u2019t buying into the idea that 36 points will be the magic number to ensure Premier League survival this season. Saints have 33 and should be fine with 10 games still to go. But he\u2019s keen to look well beyond what some are suggesting is the target number. \u201cI don\u2019t think that 36 (points) are enough this season to be honest because Fulham has a good run now and are showing up. \u201cBut we are not focusing on 36, we are focusing on getting as much points as possible, and on the weekend we have a chance of getting a few more.\u201d Danny Ings is still out injured with a leg injury while Moussa Djenepo is touch and go due to a groin issure. Hasenh\u00fcttl gave this update on the Mali midfielder: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look that bad so hopefully he can start training by the end of the week. So he could be an alternative for the weekend but we don\u2019t know it yet.\u201d       3.11pm GMT       Let\u2019s not forget that we have Premier League action tonight as Newcastle host Aston Villa. Aston Villa are again without Jack Grealish while Newcastle miss top scorer Callum Wilson along with Allan Saint-Maximin and Miguel Almir\u00f3n. A Grealish-based Opta stat:  Since returning to the Premier League last season, Aston Villa have won just 17% of their league games when Jack Grealish has been absent (1/6), compared to 35% when he plays (20/58). The Villans average just 0.7 goals-per-game without him (1.3 with) and 10.5 shots-per-game when he doesn\u2019t play (13 with).         3.03pm GMT       Thanks Luke.

Jonny Evans, Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Dennis Praet are all pretty much ready to go after injuries, says Brendan Rodgers: \u201cWe\u2019ve got really good news with Jonny Evans back and he will be available,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cDennis Praet has been training this week as well, so he should be available, and Ayoze P\u00e9rez. I\u2019ll check with all those three before we select the team, but it\u2019s great to have those back in the squad. \u201cHe (P\u00e9rez) looks very, very good in training. He was doing some finishing exercises this morning and was excellent. The thing with him is he actually has a good fitness level because he\u2019s been able to continue with that side of things, but I\u2019ll speak with him later or first thing in the morning and see where he\u2019s at. They\u2019re all available, which is important, and it gives us that flexibility.\u201d Rodgers added that there is no update on a comeback for the influential midfield schemer James Maddison.

A few lines here courtesy of PA, from Big Sam\u2019s West Brom press conference ahead of tomorrow\u2019s meeting with his former club Crystal Palace. He says that keeping the Baggies up would rank as his greatest escape: \u201cI think probably (this would be) the greatest because of the number of points we need compared to the other clubs I\u2019ve been at,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cFrom this period of 10 games to go, it\u2019s obviously a lot more difficult because of the amount of points we need to gain to try and get safe and keep this club in the Premier League. \u201cWe probably turned more victories in at Palace than we have done here at West Brom,\u201d added Allardyce. \u201cSo this period was a crucial time for me, where all the new players had settled in and helped the players already here to improve the performances - and the big slip-up is too many draws (compared) to victories. Unfortunately we look back on those periods and say those victories really should have been achieved. But in the main we can only hold ourselves accountable for that because far too many chances have been missed to win a game and that\u2019s left us in a more difficult position than we probably were at Crystal Palace.\u201d     Updated at 2.30pm GMT     2.24pm GMT       Okay, I\u2019m off to look at some videos of muddy pitches for a bit. I\u2019ll hand over to Luke McLaughlin to guide you through the next half hour or so.       2.18pm GMT       Manchester City travel to Fulham on Saturday evening and Pep Guardiola is impressed by opposite number Scott Parker. Fulham have lost just one of their last seven games and scored a  routine  famous 1-0 win at Anfield last weekend to boost hopes of avoiding relegation. Says Pep: \u201cThey play incredibly well. They were relegated with Scott and promoted again. I was really impressed when they played here with their physicality, their strength. It is a big challenge.\u201d City won the reverse fixture 2-0.       2.09pm GMT       Pep Guardiola has a grass problem. Nope, don\u2019t get the lawyers involved, he means the Etihad pitch.  They\u2019re working a lot, they are trying to find a solution but the grass is not good. All the players know how good the grass is and sometimes it is not. I know the weather conditions here in England are tough but there are stadiums where the grass is good. We were in London against Arsenal, at Anfield, at Old Trafford and the grass was better. We were in Budapest in the Champions League and the grass was incredible, red carpet \u2013 and our grass still is not good.   Dear oh dear. Check out Maine Road in the \u201870s mate.

Here\u2019s Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r again: On Martial: \u201cAnthony, he got a whack on his hip so that\u2019s another forward that we need to scan and have to look at.\u201d On Rashford: \u201cDefinitely hope Marcus is back for next Thursday in Milan, I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019ll make Sunday, but fingers crossed because we will need him.\u201d On Cavani: \u201cEdinson I don\u2019t think will be ready for Sunday, no.\u201d Paul Pogba, Donny van de Beek and Juan Mata are also out.       1.53pm GMT       Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r isn\u2019t sure if goalkeeper David De Gea will be back for the visit of West Ham on Sunday. The Spaniard has returned to England following the birth of his first child but putting him straight back into the team in place of Dean Henderson isn\u2019t that simple due to coronavirus restrictions. Current regulations allow travellers from Spain to be released from quarantine if they test negative for Covid-19 after five days of isolation.     Another fine mess for Ole to sort out. Photograph: Glyn Kirk/NMC Pool/PA Wire/PA    Totting up the days on his hand and doing his best confused Stan Laurel impression, the Manchester United boss said: \u201cYeah, David is back in Manchester. He is quarantining or self isolating. He\u2019s just touch and go for Sunday, I think. I can\u2019t really know when he came back, so I\u2019m not really sure if it was Monday or Tuesday that he arrived back in Manchester. I think the rules are that he\u2019s got to stay at home. He\u2019s not training with us anyway. It\u2019s different if you travel away and compete so, no, he\u2019s not been training since he came back.\u201d That\u2019s that cleared up then.

I hope he can recover before the end of the season.\u201d On James: \u201cJames played well, really well, against Man United and against Liverpool but he was not 100 per cent fit. We decided to give him a proper recovery and don\u2019t let him play at 70 or 80 per cent. We have taken this decision together.

Photograph: Catherine Ivill/EPA     I\u2019ve been lucky enough to work with players with great ambitions, it\u2019s not possible to have a career like mine without players with ambition. He has that, no doubt he has that. No doubt that of course he wants to win matches, score goals, win trophies. Totally committed with the club, totally committed with the national team. He\u2019s a very good example of a top professional and a top player. Sometimes top players are not always top professionals, and vice-versa. He\u2019s a top player, he\u2019s a top professional and he\u2019s a great example for everyone.        1.26pm GMT       Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho has been speaking ahead of Sunday\u2019s North London derby. The Mischievous One says he\u2019s more worried about the teams above Spurs.  I look up, I don\u2019t look down. If Arsenal was seven points ahead of us, I would look to them. But because we have seven points more than them, I don\u2019t look down. But at the same time, we look always to the next match. And if instead of Arsenal it was Villa or Newcastle, the next matches we\u2019re going to play, exactly the same feeling. We feel we\u2019re better than the position we have in the table and we want to improve our position so we need points for that. It doesn\u2019t matter the opponent, doesn\u2019t matter if it is a London derby \u2013 in fact it\u2019s the fourth in a row in the Premier League. It\u2019s a Premier League match, three points are there to fight for and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to try to do.

Latest from the PA:  Chris Wilder is set to leave Sheffield United, the PA news agency understands. An announcement is expected later on Friday which will confirm the 53-year-old has been relieved of his duties as manager. The Blades cancelled their Friday morning press conference with a player amid reports Wilder was set to be sacked, with the boss scheduled to face journalists via Zoom in the afternoon. That media duty, scheduled for 1.30pm, was also rescheduled into the early evening. But the club confirmed a player would not be appearing for interview as planned, suggesting something was going on behind the scenes.        12.49pm GMT       Have a read of Barney Ronay\u2019s latest piece on Liverpool. \u201cA brilliant team built out of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s own restless energy have come to resemble a band of hollow men limping from stage to stage, but the manager has been more or less silent on the causes. Instead he has looked uneasy, an ancient mariner stalking the fringes \u2013 a little haunted and hollow-eyed, but passing for now on the discharge of blame. This is significant in its own right. Klopp analyses, and overanalyses. He will have his own very clear version of events.

Honestly I\u2019m a bit concerned because it\u2019s still the pain from the tackle against Burnley, so we\u2019re talking about a long time now where he does not really feel 100 per cent free and comfortable; I can see it in training. On Thiago Silva: \u201cThiago also had a little setback in training, at the end of the training session, the day before yesterday, he felt at the very end something around the same area (thigh) where he was injured.

The PA news agency understands an announcement is expected later on Friday which will confirm Wilder, 53, has been relieved of his duties as manager and will leave the club.        10.54am GMT       Sheffield United have cancelled their Friday morning press conference so that looks pretty ominous. The PA have more info:  The Blades were scheduled to make a player available to the media at 10am but the club said this morning that would not be happening. It remains to be seen if the manager\u2019s afternoon press conference will go ahead \u2013 and who will be in Wilder\u2019s place should he depart beforehand. Tensions between Wilder and club owner Abdullah Bin Musa\u2019ad Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud have heightened recently, with Wilder last week stating he did not know if he will be manager next season, despite confirming he wants to remain in charge at Bramall Lane if the board and owners \u201cstick to the plan\u201d.        10.52am GMT       Meanwhile, the official Sheffield United website has a cute dog as its lead image to presumably try and defuse the rage surrounding Chris Wilder.

Build a deep coalmine \u2013 the first in decades \u2013 in Labour\u2019s historical heartland and put yourself on the side of working-class northern voters who want jobs and against environmentalists who, one could slyly suggest, prefer saving the planet than local communities. Boris Johnson thought, no doubt, with a cunning that has wrongfooted many opponents, that he could frame the argument in such terms and still meet his \u201cnet zero\u201d targets because the vast majority of Cumbrian coal would end up for export rather than domestic use (it\u2019s too sulphurous to be used to make steel in Britain). The result is that the greenhouse gas emissions would end up on some other nation\u2019s books when carbon budgets were calculated. Not dissimilar to his view of cake, Mr Johnson was saying that his policy on coal is \u201cpro having it and pro heating it\u201d. The problem for Mr Johnson was that the Biden administration was having none of it. The US had the good sense to understand the implications if Britain was allowed to press ahead with a plan to dig out coal and send it abroad without busting its own carbon budget. If everyone took the same view, the world would be toast. The US reasons that if jobs are the issue, then use state investment in green technologies for coal-free steel. Within days of John Kerry, the US climate envoy, warning Mr Johnson that coal has no future, the government conceded it would be \u201ccalling in\u201d the planning application for the Cumbrian mine. Importantly Mr Johnson would not be shamed into a U-turn in the run-up to the UN\u2019s Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November.  The climate emergency is a real threat: the UN calculates that greenhouse gas emissions must drop by 45% in the next decade to limit global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Yet mini-me Mr Johnsons keep popping up in positions of power. On Friday Mathias Cormann, an Australian rightwing coal-loving politician, was announced as the new secretary general for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Mr Cormann should not have been allowed anywhere near the job. He had labelled 2050 net zero targets as \u201cextremist \u2026 reckless and irresponsible\u201d and in office abolished a carbon pricing scheme that had driven cuts in emissions. That Mr Cormann was elected by consensus is an indictment of the process. It speaks to the OECD\u2019s concern about the rise of China, which Australia has butted heads with recently \u2013 to Mr Cormann\u2019s benefit. The OECD is where the rich world sits down to shape the global economic agenda \u2013 by getting its laggards to strive for the outcomes that its most successful members achieve. The organisation\u2019s secretary general is a powerful figure with access to G20 leaders. The OECD has a pivotal climate role as richer nations have to decarbonise first. They are responsible for the largest atmospheric stock of carbon dioxide, and have the financial as well as technological expertise to deal with it.  Climate policy by rightwingers down under amounts to following a rabbit into the hole and hoping to emerge in Wonderland. Mr Cormann\u2019s appointment is likely to be in exchange for Australia to announce its own net zero target for greenhouse emissions. This realpolitik exposes Conservatism as being engaged not with climate policy, but in a search for a superior moral justification for selfishness. Like Mr Johnson, Australian rightwingers pay lip service to environmental issues \u2013 Mr Cormann had the chutzpah to put climate at the heart of his job application \u2013 while peddling greenwash policies and state-shrinking economics. This kind of politics, which unfortunately dominates today, paves the road to perdition. If all the national pledges submitted to the UN so far were met, emissions would be reduced by only 1% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Mr Biden is talking sense when he offers a transformative fiscal and regulatory agenda to showcase the positive role of the state geared toward the creation of well-paid jobs and limiting catastrophic environmental damage.

The Spanish flu killed 50-100 million people between 1918 and 1920, the most vulnerable aged between 20 and 40. The first world war killed 17 million. And yet the pandemic had almost no place in the collective memory. There are no significant memorials to it, no famous body of literature around it. Laura Spinney, in her book Pale Rider, suggests that it was because the Spanish flu was global in scale and so confined in time \u2013 most of the deaths occurred within a few months in 1918 and 1919 \u2013 that the catastrophe did not take on a similar kind of significance to the first world war. The war, too, may have seemed more translatable into tragic narrative \u2013 a self-evidently manmade disaster, as opposed to the \u201cnatural\u201d catastrophe of disease. Though if Covid-19 has taught us anything, it is the extent to which the disease is shaped as much by politics, culture and economics as by \u201cnature\u201d. The Covid-19 pandemic is clearly quite different from Spanish flu. There are already calls to raise permanent memorials, including by St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London. This is absolutely understandable. People have put their mourning for loved ones on hold, through necessity. The normal rituals that help to channel grief \u2013 those rites, religious or otherwise, that involve the encircling, physical presence of family and friends \u2013 have been snatched away. There is a deep, human yearning for something tangible, something that people can gather around. And there is a good-hearted desire to honour those many, in different walks of life, who put themselves in danger to save, or serve, others. Yet caution is desirable. As the months roll on, and the world faces more and more bleak anniversaries, it is clear that there is much to digest about this catastrophe. Lockdowns in the UK may be easing, supposedly for the last time. But the pandemic will go on in all kinds of ways even when the intensive care units have emptied out: Britain, and much of the world, will be dealing with its own form of long Covid for years to come. There are reckonings yet to happen, too. It is clear that there has been, in the UK and in many other countries, suffering and deaths that could have been averted had better decisions been taken. Rushing to erect sculptures in stone and bronze is premature when the events are so raw. Some of the best recent memorials have been evanescent. One thinks of Jeremy Deller\u2019s haunting We\u2019re Here Because We\u2019re Here, which marked the centenary of the Battle of the Somme with the appearance of silent young men, dressed as first world war soldiers, in public places. The best permanent memorials have been highly allusive and open-ended, such as Rachel Whiteread\u2019s Holocaust memorial for Vienna, its form cast from inward-facing library shelves. For the time being, let commemorations of this pandemic be impermanent, delicate and transitory. They need be no less heartfelt, meaningful \u2013 and memorable \u2013 for that.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Long Covid more likely in working-age women than in men \u2013 study", "full_article": "Working-age women who are hospitalised with coronavirus are five times as likely to develop long Covid as men in the same age group, according to research presented to the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). Preliminary data shared with scientific advisers suggests that women under 50 are five times as likely as men under 50 to report a new disability, six times as likely to experience greater breathlessness, and twice as likely to feel more fatigued up to 11 months after leaving hospital. The findings from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium (Isaric) group have yet to be peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal, but will nonetheless raise concerns over the potential impact of Covid infections on the working population as restrictions across the UK are eased. The Isaric findings build on previous evidence that women are bearing the brunt of long Covid. According to a recent study from King\u2019s College London, women are in general twice as likely as men to have Covid symptoms last longer than a month \u2013 an effect that in some cases may be connected to differences between male and female immune systems. While more than 23 million people in the UK have now received at least one shot of vaccine, the immunisation is not 100% protective, and two-thirds of the population has yet to receive a first jab. Scientific advisers stressed that while Covid cases had come down sharply during lockdown, prevalence remained \u201cvery high\u201d compared with rates last summer. Writing in the minutes of a Sage meeting on 25 February, the advisers stressed the importance of keeping infection rates down, particularly as it remains unclear whether vaccines offer any protection against long Covid, also known as post-Covid syndromes. The document states that the long-term impact of long Covid on the working-age population \u201cis not well understood, but it may be very significant\u201d. The Isaric study reports symptoms from 325 people who were hospitalised with Covid. These make up about 40% of the patients researchers approached, and may be the ones who suffered most with long-term symptoms. Half of the patients who took part were still recovering on average seven months after being discharged. Three-quarters of these had fatigue, half were more breathless than before, and about a quarter had new disabilities affecting their sight, memory, communication or ability to walk or look after themselves. One striking finding was that persistent symptoms among those discharged from hospital were not related to older age or a person having a pre-existing medical condition. \u201cIn fact, younger participants were more likely to report persistent symptoms and ongoing difficulties,\u201d the researchers state. The Sage advisers noted that overall, the participants reported a drop in quality of life, including greater difficulty doing their usual activities and increases in anxiety, depression and pain.   Related: Long Covid: \u2018It\u2019s a year since I\u2019ve felt like myself\u2019    Further work is under way on long Covid, including studies on people who have not been hospitalised, and plans to bring together different studies to better understand the overall impact of the syndromes, the minutes add. \u201cIt will be important to have a better understanding of physiology, including oxygen levels, lung function and evidence of scarring,\u201d the document says. The minutes of the February Sage meeting go on to highlight the need for better vaccine coverage among care home workers. Figures in the document suggest that about 95% of care home residents have received at least one shot of a vaccine, compared with only 65%-70% of care home workers. The low coverage is explained by a mix of poorer access to vaccines and some hesitancy to have the jab, the scientists believe. Though uptake is gradually improving, the committee warns that \u201cin order to limit outbreaks through vaccination alone, staff coverage would need to increase to a minimum of 75% in every care home setting.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "MSPs dismiss claims Sturgeon's husband conspired to destroy Salmond", "full_article": "MSPs have dismissed allegations that messages sent by Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s husband, Peter Murrell, and other senior Scottish National party officials, proved a conspiracy to destroy Alex Salmond. WhatsApp and text messages sent by Murrell, the SNP chief executive, have been central to Salmond\u2019s claims of \u201cmalicious and concerted\u201d efforts to search out alleged victims of sexual assault and pressurise the police to investigate. Extracts of the messages were leaked last year to Kenny MacAskill, an SNP MP who was previously Scotland\u2019s justice secretary and is a Salmond ally, and fuelled claims that the party, government and prosecutors were colluding. One text from Murrell, on 25 January 2020, said it was a \u201cgood time to be pressurising\u201d police as they were \u201ctwiddling their thumbs\u201d during an apparent lull in their investigations. MSPs believe the full chain of texts refer to police requests for help in tracing victims. A second said: \u201cThe more fronts [Salmond] is having to firefight on the better for all complainers. So [Crown Prosecution Service] action would be a good thing.\u201d MSPs believe that referred to the news the CPS was not taking any action after a Met police investigation into historical allegations in London. MSPs on a Scottish parliament inquiry into the Scottish government\u2019s botched investigation of sexual assault allegations against Salmond, believe the full text messages are either justifiable or capable of having other, less sinister meanings. The Crown Office released the full texts, and those sent before and after them, after parliament issued another disclosure order instructing it to do so. The texts, while at times hyperbolic, were more innocuous than first appeared, committee members believe. They showed SNP officials and some complainers encouraging people to come forward, but not to the extent they established a conspiracy. It is understood the committee\u2019s final report, to be published on 22 or 23 March, will reject Salmond\u2019s allegations they prove unaccepted interference in the police investigation and collusion. However, the committee has not seen a batch of emails involving SNP officials who became complainers in Salmond\u2019s criminal trial. Salmond believes those do show unjustified collusion, but they are not being sought because they relate directly to the trial. Salmond told the Holyrood inquiry last month he first saw those messages in January 2020, two months before he went on trial on 14 charges of sexual assault, including one attempted rape. He was acquitted of every charge. Reading them \u201cwas one of the most extraordinary days of my life\u201d, he said. They showed \u201cpressurising the police \u2026 pressurising witnesses and collusion with witnesses\u201d and the \u201cconstruction of evidence\u201d. Murrell rejected Salmond\u2019s claims the texts proved a conspiracy but, in his evidence session last month, acknowledged the language was inappropriate and \u201cout of character.\u201d He said: \u201cTo me, that suggests just how upset I was at the time.\u201d Committee members believe Holyrood should publish the full exchanges, as there was a risk the selective leaking had mischaracterised them to the public. The committee has asked Murrell, and two other SNP officials involved in the discussions, Sue Ruddick, the chief operating officer, and Ian McCann, its compliance officer, for permission to publish them. The committee has yet to decide how they can see Scottish government emails that may show senior officials were unhappy about alleged interference in the internal inquiry into harassment complaints about Salmond, made by a government official.

Jennifer Morgan, the executive director of Greenpeace International, said: \u201cWe have little confidence in Cormann\u2019s ability to ensure the OECD is a leader in tackling the climate crisis, when he has an atrocious record on the issue. If the OECD is to fulfil its mandate, it must confront the climate emergency, arguably the biggest social justice issue of our time.\u201d   Related: Mathias Cormann elected OECD chief despite climate record    Nick Mabey, the chief executive of the E3G thinktank, said: \u201cOECD countries have just sent a dangerous signal by appointing someone with a track record of dismantling climate policy to run their main advisory body. This appointment will lower pressure on the leaders of other international institutions to undertake radical reforms to tackle the climate crisis.\u201d Developing countries were particularly concerned. Saleem Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh, said: \u201cThe appointment of a climate sceptic from Australia to head the OECD is very disappointing and will reduce the credibility of the OECD as an institution in the eyes of developing countries.\u201d The UK government was also sharply criticised for its role in backing Cormann\u2019s election as it prepares to host UN climate talks in Glasgow this November. Mohamed Adow, the director of the Power Shift Africa thinktank, said: \u201cIt\u2019s terrible to see a politician with such a poor record on climate action getting the job of leading the OECD. What makes it worse is that apparently his appointment was backed by the UK, despite them [being] about to host the crucial Cop26 summit.\u201d Cormann opposed climate action on many occasions while a government minister between 2013 and 2020. He voted down motions to declare a climate emergency, called net zero targets \u201cextremist\u201d, \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d, spoke in favour of the coal industry and against wind energy, and was criticised for telling young climate strikers to \u201cstick to school\u201d. Some climate experts, however, said Cormann could still carry on the OECD\u2019s work on climate action despite his record. Some pointed privately to the World Bank, where the climate advocate Jim Yong Kim was replaced in 2019 by David Malpass, an adviser to Donald Trump with little previous enthusiasm for climate issues. Despite misgivings, the World Bank has retained a strong focus on climate action. The climate economist Nicholas Stern said: \u201cCormann comes from a government in Australia which has often been ambiguous at best in its commitment to tackling climate change. [He] must show the necessary commitment right from the start of his tenure. The world must act now and the OECD must continue to lead.\u201d The OECD decision runs against the tide of recent appointments of senior figures to major international institutions. Officials with a track record of advocating strong climate action, many of them women, now lead several key organisations. Kristalina Georgieva, formerly of the World Bank and European commission, is chief of the International Monetary Fund, where she has made the climate a focus. Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank, spoke of the urgent need for climate action as the UK launched Cop26 last year, and Odile Renaud-Basso took over last year at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, where she has pledged to push climate action forward. The World Trade Organization is headed by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a former Nigerian finance minister who has long taken a strong stance on the climate. One of Cormann\u2019s key actions while a government minister was to quash plans for carbon pricing. This stands in stark contrast to the man he has succeeded at the OECD, \u00c1ngel Gurr\u00eda, who had been a prominent figure at international climate forums since his appointment in 2006.  In one of his last interviews as secretary general, Gurria told the Guardian: \u201cThe single most important intergenerational responsibility is to protect the planet. We are on a collision course with nature, and we have to change course for future generations; to protect biodiversity to stop it from being degraded; to protect soil; to protect lands and water; to protect the oceans \u2026 and put a big fat price on carbon.\u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Sinn F\u00e9in calls Boris Johnson's visit to Northern Ireland publicity stunt", "full_article": "A visit by Boris Johnson to Northern Ireland to promote its centenary and response to Covid-19 has triggered a political row with Sinn F\u00e9in, which branded his visit a publicity stunt. \nThe prime minister went to a vaccination centre in County Fermanagh and unveiled plans to mark the state\u2019s foundation a 100 years ago during a one-day visit on Friday. \nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s deputy first minister, Michelle O\u2019Neill, did not welcome Johnson to Belfast or attend any of his events after he declined to meet her and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, to discuss the Stormont executive and post-Brexit arrangements.

The WHO\u2019s global advisory committee on vaccine safety is currently reviewing the reports and will revert on its findings, she added, as it does with any safety issues. \u201cIt is very important we are hearing safety signals because if we were not hearing about safety signals that would suggest there is not enough review and vigilance\u201d,\u201d she said.

Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA      Updated at 2.57pm GMT     2.46pm GMT       Here is some analysis from my colleague Nicola Davis on the official survey release earlier that suggested infection rates across England and Wales are decreasing while those in Northern Ireland and Scotland appear to be levelling off (see 12.26pm). The latest ONS figures are welcome news: once again the proportion of people testing positive for Covid has fallen, with 1 in 270 people in the community in England thought to have had coronavirus between 28 February and 6 March, compared with 1 in 220 the week before.  The ONS data reveals that declines were seen across all age groups, except primary school aged children where the trend was unclear, and in the majority of regions \u2013 although early signs of a potential rise in rates in the south-east and south-west will no doubt be watched carefully.A decline in the proportion of people testing positive for Covid has also been seen in Wales, while it appears to have levelled off in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The latest figure for England is the lowest since the end of September when around 1 in 240 people in the community were thought to have Covid. Data for confirmed cases also suggests current figures on a par with those from mid to late September.  But while, it is tempting to think we are almost out of the woods, rates remain far higher than in the summer: between 6 July and 12 July 2020 just 1 in 2,300 people in the community in England were estimated to have had the coronavirus. Indeed it was in mid-September, that the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) concluded that a two-week nationwide \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d lockdown was necessary to reduce the spread of coronavirus \u2013 although at that point infections were rising rather than falling, and there were no vaccinations to help weaken the link between infections and hospital admissions or deaths. The new ONS data does not capture the impact of the first steps in the government\u2019s roadmap to ease restrictions, such as the return of children to schools; indeed this is unlikely to show up for some weeks. But as the the country prepares to unlock, all eyes will be on surveys such as this, to see whether we can stay on track, or will need a plan B.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images         2.14pm GMT       Mark Drakeford has defended plans to allow supermarkets to sell non-essential goods ahead of non-essential shops opening in Wales (see 12.57pm.). The first minister said Welsh households would be able to purchase non-essential goods in supermarkets from 22 March for the first time since before Christmas. He said:  It is safer to do it with shops that are open already because they are already having to comply with all the strict standards that we strengthened in the regulations we passed in the Senedd in January. So we know that these are safe places to visit and I know that environmental health officers of local authorities will be visiting those settings in the coming week to make sure that they are ready to continue to operate in that way after 22 March.  Drakeford said the retail sector had advised that it needed time to reopen safely, to return staff from furlough and to demonstrate they could comply with standards in Wales. He added:   I was also anxious about opening non-essential retail in the full sense here in Wales while no shops at all for non-essential purposes are open in England because that acts as a perverse incentive for people to travel across the border.  That would be to break the rules in England and to break the rules in Wales but you don\u2019t want to create the conditions in which it is more tempting for people to do that.     Updated at 2.26pm GMT     1.47pm GMT       A \u201cmixed picture\u201d across the UK this week, with the number of people infected with Covid-19 continuing to fall across England, but appearing to be levelling off in Northern Ireland and Scotland, PA Media reports. New estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that around one in 270 people in private households in England had coronavirus between February 28 and March 6 \u2013 the equivalent of 200,600 people. This is down from around one in 220, or 248,100 people, for the period 21-27 February. It is the lowest figure since the week to 24 September when the estimate stood at one in 470, or 116,600 people. However, the number of people infected in England is still high when compared to last summer. In the week to 25 August, around one in 2,000 people had coronavirus. Meanwhile, the latest data for Wales shows around one in 365 people are estimated to have had Covid-19 between 28 February and 6 March \u2013 down from one in 285 the week before. In Northern Ireland, around one in 310 people were infected, up from one in 325.The estimate for Scotland was around one in 320 people, up from one in 335 the previous week. The ONS said the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in a majority of regions in England but there were \u201cearly signs of a possible increase ... in the south-east and south-west.\u201d Sarah Crofts, senior statistician for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said:   We are seeing a mixed picture across the UK this week. It\u2019s reassuring to see infection levels in the majority of English regions also continuing to decrease - however, it\u2019s important for us to remain cautious and closely monitor those regions that are not showing a clear decrease. These are in the south of England, Yorkshire and the Humber and the West Midlands.\u201d  In England the estimates for the latest six-week period are based on 529,020 swab tests. Meanwhile, government scientific advisers said the latest reproduction number (the R) estimate for the UK is between 0.6 and 0.8, down from 0.7 and 0.9 last week. It comes after data on Thursday showed more than 23 million people have now had their first dose of a vaccine.    Updated at 2.18pm GMT     1.40pm GMT    R-value across UK is between 0.6 and 0.8    The coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, across the UK is between 0.6 and 0.8, according to the latest UK government figures. R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below 1, it means the epidemic is shrinking. An R number between 0.6 and 0.8 means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between six and eight other people. The latest growth rate is between minus 7% and minus 4%, which means the number of new infections is shrinking by between 4% and 7% every day.    Updated at 1.43pm GMT     1.36pm GMT       Afternoon!

The property group, which also owns the Bicester Village designer outlet, said the closure of non-essential shops during lockdowns and the suspension of rent payments for struggling retailers in 2020 fuelled the biggest annual fall in rental income in company history. Annual losses more than doubled from \u00a3781m in 2019 to \u00a31.7bn last year.   Related: Bullring and Brent Cross mall owner must sell more properties to survive Covid crisis         1.09pm GMT       A coronavirus vaccine the UK has secured 60m doses of is 86% effective against the Kent variant, the company behind the jab, Novavax, has announced. PA reports:  The Novavax vaccine is also 96% effective in preventing cases caused by the original strain of the coronavirus. According to results of phase three trial in the UK, the jab offers 100% protection against severe disease, including all hospital admission and death. Stanley Erck, president and chief executive officer at Novavax, said: \u201cWe are very encouraged by the data showing that NVX-CoV2373 not only provided complete protection against the most severe forms of disease, but also dramatically reduced mild and moderate disease across both trials. Importantly, both studies confirmed efficacy against the variant strains.\u201d The study in the UK enrolled more than 15,000 participants aged between 18 and 84, including 27% over the age of 65. In participants 65 years of age and older, 10 cases of Covid-19 were observed, with 90% of those cases occurring in the placebo group. Novavax expects to use the data to submit for regulatory approval across the world.  Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, University of Southampton, said:   One note of caution is the observed lower effectiveness against B.1.351 variant of concern, as first observed in South Africa. This shows the impact variants can have upon the pandemic response and thus is a strong argument for keeping cases as low as possible whilst the burden of Covid-19 is high. However, there is still a clear protective effect there in the Novavax trial, and data from across all the Covid-19 vaccines suggests that they will be hugely protective against severe illness from all variants, which is still an excellent outcome.     Updated at 1.12pm GMT     1.02pm GMT       A study into the impact of vaccination on transmission is \u201cvery encouraging\u201d, the Scottish health secretary, Jeane Freeman, has said. The study of 300,000 people, led by Public Health Scotland and Glasgow University, suggests there is at least a 30% reduction in transmission as a result of the first dose of the vaccine, while the second dose gives at least 54% (see 12.58pm). Speaking at the coronavirus briefing in Edinburgh, Freeman said:   It\u2019s obviously very encouraging data indeed.

The announcement comes as a blow to parts of the industry that were expecting an earlier reopening date, with Drakeford previously saying the restart would be considered for this week\u2019s review of coronavirus restrictions. Businesses said the Welsh government had left them with \u201cthe impression of being marched to the top of the hill, only to be asked to walk back down again\u201d, while the Welsh Conservatives claimed the move was a \u201cU-turn\u201d and Plaid Cymru accused Mr Drakeford of offering \u201cfalse hope\u201d.

They claim that the delay to locking down was a key factor in Britain having one of the highest coronavirus death rates in the world. On this day last year, ITV political editor Robert Peston wrote in the Spectator:  The key phrase we all need to understand is \u2018herd immunity\u2019 \u2013 which is what happens to a group of people or animals when they develop sufficient antibodies to be resistant to a disease. The strategy of the British government in minimising the impact of Covid-19 is to allow the virus to pass through the entire population so that we acquire herd immunity, but at a much delayed speed so that those who suffer the most acute symptoms are able to receive the medical support they need, and such that the health service is not overwhelmed and crushed by the sheer number of cases it has to treat at any one time. The kind of coercive measures employed by China in Wuhan and Hubei have simply locked the virus behind the closed doors of people\u2019s homes. And just as soon as the constraints on freedom of movement are lifted there, the monstrous virus will rear its hideous face again.

One thing about pets is that they always seem pleased to see you, especially dogs. So that combination, families and dogs, are probably the things that keep you sane.\u201d Confirming the old adage that if you want a friend in politics, get a dog. At least they don\u2019t lobby you on your department\u2019s failings on free school meals. Williamson lavished praise on the teaching profession for its work during what he called \u201cthe single greatest disruption to our education system since the second world war\u201d.

Early anecdotes from long Covid patients who have received the vaccine demonstrate that responses may be varied, with some patients reporting an alleviation of symptoms and others experiencing more intense side-effects. These reactions need to be studied, understood, and recommendations about the vaccine need to take long Covid patients into account.    Related: Will vaccines protect from 'long-haul Covid'? We need answers | Fiona Lowenstein         11.36am GMT       The coronavirus pandemic has inspired more than a third (35%) of children to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem), new data suggests. A survey of more than 2,000 parents of children aged five to 16 across the UK found that 50% of youngsters cited NHS frontline staff, the scientists behind the Covid-19 vaccine rollout (31%) and the Mars rover landing (24%) as events that have most inspired. According to the figures, children in the UK are most inspired to be doctors or nurses (29%) and astronauts (25%).       11.10am GMT       Almost half of parents with dependent children have voiced concern about their return to school or college, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows. Some 47% of adults said they were very or somewhat worried about their child\u2019s return, the ONS said. It analysed responses from 4,334 adults in Britain who were polled between 3-7 March as part of its Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, including 780 parents. Three in 10 said they were not at all worried about their child returning to educational settings.       10.58am GMT       Transmission of Covid-19 drops by at least 30% after a person is vaccinated, a new study suggests. Public Health Scotland and the University of Glasgow assessed 300,000 NHS workers between 8 December - the first day of vaccination in Scotland - and 3 March. The researchers looked at the records of people who live with both vaccinated and unvaccinated healthcare workers, finding those who had a single dose were at least 30% less likely to pass the virus on.  Those who have had both doses of vaccine were found to be at least 54% less likely to pass on the virus. The study, using record linkage, compared cases of Covid-19 and hospitalisations due to the virus in household members of both vaccinated, and unvaccinated health care workers. Dr Diane Stockton, PHS Lead for Covid-19 vaccination surveillance programme, said:  The results from this study as part of our vaccine effectiveness work, are very encouraging because it suggests that the vaccine helps prevent people from passing on the virus to others - something that has been suspected but hasn\u2019t previously been shown.      Updated at 11.01am GMT     10.49am GMT       The former health secretary Jeremy Hunt caught coronavirus just days after receiving the vaccine. Writing on a local news website, he said:  Having ducked the cursed virus for over a year, the dreaded news came through from NHS Test and Trace on Tuesday morning. Ironically, it happened to be half-an-hour before chairing a Select Committee at which Sir Simon Stevens was the guest witness, something I was able to do because my symptoms remain very mild. But as someone who has complained loudly in the past about failings with NHS Test and Trace, I was amused to see my phone buzzing throughout the morning as they tried to get in touch with me with great diligence. In fact, the success of Test and Trace is something that should be more talked about alongside the better-known achievements of the vaccine programme. Indeed, from my experience, it has become a model of efficiency.  He and his wife and their three children must now stay home and self isolate for 10 days. Last week, Hunt received his first dose of the vaccine, which takes time to kick in and is most optimal after both doses. It remains unclear whether it entirely prevents people from contracting and transmitting the virus, though there have been promising indications.    Jab done!

The BBC reports that is 22 fewer than the previous week and brings the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency\u2019s total of Covid-related registered deaths to 2,839.

He is now stressing that a further reopening of Wales\u2019s tourism industry would be halted if holiday providers are found to be taking bookings from people in England over Easter. People living under lockdown restrictions in England will not be able to holiday in Wales when self-contained accommodation in the country is allowed to reopen from 27 March 27. He told the PA news agency:   People who let accommodation should not be taking bookings from people who live outside Wales. We will be talking with our local authority colleagues and with the police next week, just to see if there is anything we need to do to mobilise our own enforcement authorities. If the industry were to act irresponsibly, the penalty would be we wouldn\u2019t be able to carry on reopening the industry. I know there are rogues in any part of life. But I think that the industry will absolutely recognise that we want to go beyond self-contained accommodation. We want the tourism industry in Wales to have a longer and better season this year than we managed last year.        10.00am GMT       The government in England is doing nothing to prevent the preexisting crisis in social care from becoming a calamity, writes Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee.

Speaking on Good Morning Britain, she said:   Last year we saw an increase of applications into nursing of 34% and we\u2019re expecting similar, if not higher, levels again this year. People have been so taken aback by the role of these individuals that they also want to play their part.  However, gruelling 12-hour shifts, exhaustion and burnout are leading growing numbers of nurses to quit the NHS within three years of joining, research has shown. Donelan also said that increasing nurses\u2019 pay by more than 1% would not be a U-turn as the review is a \u201cprocess\u201d, amid growing criticism on the government that the offer was \u201ca slap in the face\u201d and could amount to a real-terms pay cut due to inflation. She also backed the police, after Reclaim These Streets \u2013 the group planning to hold a vigil on Saturday evening close to the spot where Sarah Everard disappeared \u2013 said it has been told that such action would be unlawful due to Covid restrictions and could bring criminal prosecution and thousands of pounds in fines. \u201cAs a woman I also recognise that we\u2019re in a global pandemic and restrictions are in place to safeguard the lives of women and men,\u201d she told Sky News.

He told BBC Radio 5 Live:   It is guidance and is to be interpreted in people\u2019s individual circumstances. Of course there will be people, in rural Wales particularly, who don\u2019t live five miles away from a shop - they would have to travel further, and they\u2019ll be able to do that over the next two weeks. People can interpret it with some flexibility in their local circumstances.  Drakeford was asked to give an assurance that people would not be penalised if they travelled more than five miles to go to a shop or hairdressers.  Provided that they are not passing lots of shops in order to go to another one, then of course that will be consistent with the rule.        9.23am GMT    Wales to begin gradually easing measures from tomorrow    Some semblance of normal life will begin again in Wales from Saturday, with the country\u2019s first minister, Mark Drakeford, expected to announce a change from the current \u201cstay home\u201d restrictions to more lenient \u201cstay local\u201d requirements. This morning, he said coronavirus numbers in Wales were continuing to go in the right direction\u201d, and that people from two households will be able to meet in gardens from Saturday, while hairdressers and barbers will be able to operate from Monday. Non-essential retail will begin to reopen from 22 March. Drakeford told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme:   Provided things continue to go in the right direction, we hope to be able to reopen self-contained accommodation for the Easter period.  He said that in many Welsh homes, people would need to go through the house to access the back garden but \u201cthe idea is you walk straight through, out the back door into the garden\u201d.  That will be a big step forward here in Wales, people haven\u2019t been able to do that now for weeks and weeks. For many families that will allow grandparents to see grandchildren again and it\u2019s a sign that cautiously, carefully and step by step, we\u2019re now on the journey of reopening Welsh society.  Drakeford added that he has \u201canxieties\u201d about the resumption of foreign travel from as early as 17 May.  I do not want to see all the hard work that people in Wales have put in over recent weeks being undermined by the reimportation of the virus. The prime minister\u2019s road map for England is very clear that these are indicative dates and when I\u2019ve raised this with UK ministers they always emphasise that the decision would be made in the circumstances much closer to the time. I am saying that for me, that does look early. I would want to be completely confident that we are not running the risk of a reimportation of the virus, particularly now that we know there are new variants of this virus in other parts of the world.

Cycling, after all, has a long history of \u201cdodgy doctors\u201d, the most renowned of all being Michele Ferrari, Lance Armstrong\u2019s infamous performance guru. In a sport long shadowed by scandal, the wondrous achievements of Team Sky under the management of Dave Brailsford were always viewed sceptically. But this is also a story of subterfuge, failed vetting procedures and manipulation of facts, even before a government select committee.   Related: Team Sky and British Cycling in dock after Freeman guilty verdict    In Britain, a nation and media largely naive to the inner workings of the professional peloton and dazzled by the slew of successes in both track and road racing swallowed the story of marginal gains and magical pillows, whole. Now the scepticism that was always bubbling under the surface in Europe towards the explosion of British success appears even more well-founded. The Freeman verdict, that the former Team Sky and British Cycling doctor was guilty of ordering testosterone \u201cknowing or believing\u201d it was to be given to a rider to improve their athletic performance, is damning and has led to UK Anti-Doping bringing further charges of doping infractions against him. Brailsford has not yet responded to the Guardian\u2019s requests for comment. Throughout their sponsorship, however, Team Sky always stuck to the line used at their team launch: \u201cWe follow the rules and we ride clean.\u201d After the Freeman verdict was announced, Ineos Grenadiers, the current incarnation of that team, issued a statement saying: \u201cIt is very clear from their report that Richard Freeman fell short of the ethical standards required of him as a doctor and acted dishonestly. However, the Team does not believe that any athlete ever used or sought to use Testogel or any other performance enhancing substance.\u201d However, hard as they try, this is a story that Brailsford and his staff, past and present, at British Cycling and Team Sky and now Ineos Grenadiers, can no longer evade. Brian Cookson, the president of British Cycling between 1996 and 2013, was more forthcoming than Brailsford. \u201cI was proud and privileged to have overseen a period of unprecedented success in the sport, leading to a massive increase in its popularity and profile,\u201d Cookson said. \u201cThat this should now be open to question is a matter of extreme concern to me and all of those who work or have worked behind the scenes in our sport, in governance, management, administration and coaching.\u201d Prior to the arrival of Brailsford and Team Sky, doping had long dominated the European cycling headlines. A decade or more of debilitating revelations, from the Festina affair, Operation Puerto, the Floyd Landis scandal, and in late 2012, the downfall of Lance Armstrong, had crippled the peloton\u2019s credibility. In 2010 Team Sky came to the rescue, proclaiming their integrity, their vetting skills and their credibility, vowing to win the Tour de France \u201cclean\u201d. It was a message that was a breath of fresh air for fans, weary of years of doubt and disappointment. In Britain, the sales pitch of Sky as cycling\u2019s saviours was embraced almost unquestioningly. Yet within a sport that is still haunted by its past, there were always whispers of just how close to rule-breaking the team would go. In Europe, suspicion stalked the team after they reversed the poor performances of their early outings into the all-conquering Grand Tour successes of Wiggins, Froome and Thomas.     Ineos Grenadiers said: \u2018It is very clear from their report that Richard Freeman [pictured] fell short of the ethical standards required of him.\u2019 Photograph: Eleanor Crooks/PA    There were furores over their admitted use of the potent painkiller tramadol, now banned by cycling\u2019s governing body, and obfuscation and confusion over the use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) by both Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome. Froome, who benefitted from a TUE in April 2014, when he won the Tour of Romandie, told the BBC a year later that he had declined a TUE in the latter stages of the 2015 Tour de France because \u201cit did not sit well morally with me\u201d. A further problem for Brailsford and his management structures is that Freeman is not the first \u201cdodgy doctor\u201d. Wiggins\u2019s career-making golden summer of 2012, which included multiple stage race wins, Tour de France success and Olympic glory, was achieved when Geert Leinders, now banned for life for doping offences, was retained as a medical consultant. Brailsford maintained that Leinders was always a distant presence, but subsequently admitted to an error of judgment in hiring a man whose name became a byword for doping in the Netherlands, where he worked for the disgraced Rabobank team. But then Sky\u2019s zero tolerance policy, based on recruiting from a pool of professionals in which it was impossible to guarantee propriety, had been unworkable from the outset. The team\u2019s much-vaunted vetting procedures failed abjectly, when they were forced to shed staff \u2013 such as Bobby Julich and Steven de Jongh, supposedly scrupulously vetted by Brailsford and Steve Peters \u2013 who had subsequently admitted an involvement in doping earlier in their careers. Yet Brailsford, whether scrutinised by the media, catcalled by roadside fans, or grilled by a digital, culture, media and sport committee in Westminster, has ploughed on regardless. The big wins kept on coming, even as the doctors came and went. Recently he has talked of having \u201cmore fun\u201d with cycling, although that seems less likely given the latest turn of events.     Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.   Brailsford was talked about, but never seen, during the Freeman hearings. Now many will ask where is the man the French media once knowingly titled \u201cMonsieur Zero Tolerance\u201d in all this? As he has been so often during the difficult moments, the architect of the British cycling success story, from its beginnings through to the present day, remains the Invisible Man. And what will Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s view be of the Freeman verdict? Two years ago, when the Ineos takeover of Team Sky\u2019s personnel and infrastructure was unveiled, the billionaire entrepreneur sat alongside Brailsford and made his ethical position clear. \u201cWe did our due diligence,\u201d he said. \u201cI have absolutely no interest in cheating or drugs.

In his decision, he cited new climate change advice and rising controversy over the plans, following vocal criticism from government scientific advisers and leading scientists.   Related: Robert Jenrick orders public inquiry into Cumbria coalmine    The case has a recent precedent: a similar call-in decision was made in 2019 by Jenrick\u2019s predecessor, James Brokenshire, over plans for an opencast mine at Druridge Bay in Northumberland. Jenrick finally rejected the scheme last autumn, 18 months after Brokenshire\u2019s decision.Cumbria county council will sit alongside the firm bringing the application, West Cumbria Mining, and local campaign group South Lakeland Against Climate Change as the main bodies submitting evidence to the public inquiry.Although \u201clandscape considerations\u201d took precedence over climate concerns in the Druridge Bay inquiry, campaigners say they are hopeful that the government\u2019s climate commitments will be central to the Cumbria inquiry. The Committee on Climate Change, the government\u2019s statutory advisers, urged a 78% cut in the UK\u2019s carbon emissions by 2035 in order to meet the government\u2019s legally binding target of net-zero emissions by 2050. Supporters of the mine argue that extracting coking coal in west Cumbria will reduce domestic industry\u2019s reliance on imported coal, thus cutting carbon emissions that they say the UK \u201coutsources\u201d to other countries at present.But campaigners say the 2.7m tonnes of coking coal that would be extracted each year from beneath the Irish Sea will greatly exceed the projected domestic demand for the resource, with just 360,000 tonnes \u2013 about 15% of the total \u2013 expected to be supplied to UK-based firms. In a letter to the county council announcing the decision, the Department of Communities, Housing and Local Government advised that Jenrick \u201cparticularly wishes to be informed about\u201d how the mining plans would square with the government\u2019s climate change commitments, along with policy on the sustainable use of minerals and sustainable development in the area.Jenrick will be entitled not to follow the planning inspector\u2019s recommendation once it is made. However, campaigners say he may leave himself open to legal challenge if he is considered to have ignored the inspector\u2019s findings.The inquiry is set to take place in early summer and is expected to last about two weeks. Its conclusions, and a subsequent government decision, may not be forthcoming until next year.Environmental campaigners hope the decision\u2019s proximity to the Cop26 UN climate summit, which the UK is hosting in November, may sway the government\u2019s decision, with intensive lobbying expected from both camps.Anne Harris, of Coal Action Network, said Jenrick\u2019s failure to take a clear climate stance in the Druridge Bay case has led to complications in approaching the Cumbrian scheme.\u201cIn the Druridge decision, following a public inquiry in 2017, the secretary of state dodged the question of whether extracting more coal leads to more coal being consumed, and thus greater amounts of greenhouse gases being released,\u201d she said.\u201cThis time he cannot avoid taking a position on this issue. The future of our planet depends on politicians and companies acting to dramatically limit the release of gases which cause climate change. \u201cIf Jenrick had been strong in taking a stance against the Druridge application on climate change grounds, it is possible that this application in Cumbria would never have been approved.\u201d Meanwhile, the former government climate change representative, John Ashton, said the wording of Jenrick\u2019s call-in letter this week was \u201ca disgrace: a farrago of false trails, obfuscation, and low-grade thinking and drafting \u2026 In any case, this welcome decision is about crude climate politics and nothing else.\u201d Pressure on the UK on the global stage may also have affected the decision, he said, with many taking the view that the UK should be setting a good example internationally as hosts of the crucial Cop26 climate conference. \u201cI imagine they will be telling \u2026 northern Tories to bide their time and press their case after [Cop26 in] Glasgow.

She called him frantically, only to be directed to his voicemail. \u201cI was conflicted about where to go, to his house or the mosque\u201d, Aya says, \u201cor whether the whole thing was real.\u201d In the meantime the city had turned into a war zone and police officers were everywhere.     Aya and Hussein at a party in Christchurch Photograph: Ces Photography cecilio Barra Iii/Aya Al-Umari    Aya somehow managed to get to her brother\u2019s house, but there was no sign of him. \u201cI was thinking that he is not home, which meant that he is in the hospital.\u201d The family was forced to exist in a state of limbo for six long days before police finally asked the family to identify Hussein\u2019s body. He was the last victim to be identified. Even though it took almost a week for the family to get confirmation of his death, \u201cWe started grieving the day after [the attack],\u201d Aya says. Police warned the family that they might be shocked upon seeing his body, but Aya believes that \u201cHussein was at peace\u201d, the main characteristic of a Shaheed, an Islamic term used to refer to those who are thought to have been killed for their faith. In the aftermath of the attack there was an outpouring of support for the victims and their families. One woman delivered homemade soup to Aya and her family every day for several weeks. \u201cIt was a small gesture, but it meant the world to us,\u201d says Aya.     Flowers outside the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand in the days following the 15 March 2019 shooting Photograph: Jorge Silva/Reuters    The flower wall by Al Noor mosque became a symbol of New Zealanders\u2019 condemnation of the horrific crime and their support for the Muslim community. Two years on, commuters still stop by 101 Deans Avenue to place flowers next to the mosque\u2019s entrance. This is not to say that hate towards immigrants has miraculously disappeared. Aya and her mother were recently subjected to a racist rant in a Waimakariri shopping mall, after a stranger heard them talking in Arabic. \u201cWhile we tried to diffuse her racial tirade towards us by telling her we lost our brother in the terrorist attack, it\u2019s sad that it happened in the first place. It was important for me to call it out,\u201d Aya says. During the sentencing of Brenton Tarrant in August, Hussein\u2019s mother forgave him for the murder of her son. \u201cI decided to forgive you Mr Tarrant because I don\u2019t have hate. I don\u2019t have revenge \u2026 Damage was done, and Hussein will never be here, so I have only one choice and [that is] to forgive you,\u201d Janna Ezat told the court. Aya described the devastating scenes she had witnessed in Christchurch hospital: \u201cI will never ever forget the distressing scenes of people covered in blood, and the weeping sound of children crying. These images and sounds will stay in my mind for ever,\u201d she said.     Aya Al-Umari, pictured overlooking the city of Christchurch, New Zealand Photograph: Peter Meecham/The Guardian    Immediately after the attack, the video livestreamed by the shooter was circulating online. Aya could not initially locate her brother in it, but she heard him shouting \u201cGet out, Get out\u201d in Arabic. This was later confirmed by witness accounts. The internal CCTV footage was later reviewed by the police who said that Hussein had also gestured at the terrorist with his palms raised. It is not possible to know what was going on inside Hussein\u2019s head, but his family believe he acted heroically in those moments, attempting to position himself to tackle the shooter. \u201cMy family knew Hussein wouldn\u2019t run away,\u201d Aya says.

He always hugged me.\u201d Their birthdays were just one day apart and the pair always celebrated together. Since the 2019 attacks, Aya has been volunteering as a security guard at Al Noor mosque. She does that, Aya says, \u201cto live Hussein\u2019s legacy and to honour what he has done.\u201d Towards the end of the interview, Aya says her family will be moving to Auckland soon. Can they no longer tolerate the city of Christchurch and the painful memories it holds? \u201cNo, that\u2019s not the case at all. We\u2019re not escaping. This is just a step forward.\u201d  This article was translated by Mohsen Kafi, a PhD researcher in literary translation studies at Victoria University of Wellington.

The outcry over Doug Ford\u2019s comments highlights the sensitivity of the accusations as well as the broader challenges of addressing vaccine hesitancy in Indigenous communities, a group that still faces discrimination within the healthcare system. At Ontario\u2019s legislative assembly on Thursday, Ford denounced Sol Mamakwa for \u201cjumping the line\u201d to receive shots. Mamakwa received his vaccine in two remote communities at the request of their leadership. \u201cI talked to a few chiefs that were pretty upset about that, for flying into a community that he doesn\u2019t belong to,\u201d Ford said, without naming those chiefs. The premier\u2019s office initially said he had no plans to apologize, but on Friday afternoon issued a statement saying Ford had phoned Mamakwa to express his regret for his comments.  Mamakwa, a member of the New Democratic party and resident of King Fisher First Nation in northern Ontario, is the only lawmaker in the provincial legislature from a First Nations community. In March, he was invited by leaders of two fly-in communities \u2013 Muskrat Dam and Sandy Lake \u2013 to help combat vaccine hesitancy among residents. He posted on social media about his vaccination. On Thursday, Mamakwa expressed dismay over Ford\u2019s \u201clack of respect\u201d towards Indigenous peoples. \u201cIt was a hard decision for me to make even to go [get] the vaccine because of this,\u201d he said \u201cIt\u2019s not jumping the line, but providing leadership.\u201d After he went to the communities, both within his electoral district of Kiiwetinoong, more residents signed up to get their vaccine. Opposition leaders also demanded that Ford apologize to Mamakwa and First Nation residents. \u201cVaccine hesitancy is a reality in many communities as a result of generations of systemic racism, historic traumas and poor treatment by the health system,\u201d the NDP leader, Andrea Horwath, told reporters. \u201c[Mamakwa] did what all of us are called to do. He stepped up, he led by example and he continues to be a big part of the efforts to show that the vaccine is safe.\u201d Ontario\u2019s health minister, Christine Elliott, defended Ford, saying the premier was simply expressing frustration because of the \u201ccontinuing work\u201d of vaccinating First Nations people. \u201cEveryone needs to wait their turn.

It\u2019s also been a year since Trump delivered a rambling, off-script address to the nation in which he downplayed the risks of the virus. \u201cTrump\u2019s bizarre, half-hearted speech one year ago is in stunning contrast to the seriousness and gravitas of the speech President Biden delivered tonight, exactly one year later, to mark the pain the country has endured while also offering hope for the future,\u201d said Meyers, noting the $1.9tn Covid stimulus bill Biden signed on Thursday. The bill is enormously popular, with 75% of Americans and 59% of Republicans approving the measure, \u201cand yet Republicans have derided it as a so-called partisan bill\u201d, said Meyers. But some of the \u201cmost galling behavior\u201d, he added, came from Republicans who tried to take credit for aspects of the bill while still voting against it, such as Senator Roger Wicker, a \u201cno\u201d vote who tweet-bragged about stimulus money for small businesses. \u201cI know these guys are shameless, but I\u2019m still shocked,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cThey\u2019re the kind of guys who would run out and try and lift Tom Brady on their shoulders while wearing Chiefs jerseys.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "The Fiver | Bamboozling managers with new-fangled tactics and shouts of 'BASHY!'", "full_article": "A WALK ON THE WILDER SIDE Fan.

As well-researched as they were, these footballing experts and opinion-formers could scarcely have been more wrong and Wilder raised eyebrows and expectations with his habit of repeatedly bamboozling opposing managers with his new-fangled tactics of employing overlapping centre-backs while shouting \u201cBASHY!

She was, she said, \u201cdying of everything and of nothing in particular\u201d. And yet, fully mentally competent, she was not able to have the assisted death she earnestly and logically craved. She had to do it herself, but not before the police, accompanied by a social worker, a doctor and a psychiatrist, had broken down her front door in their unsuccessful search for the illegally-imported poison she later used. This cannot be right in a civilised country. A change in the law to allow assisted dying must surely come. A majority of the UK population want it to. We have a chance to realise this in the new Scottish parliament, for which we will be voting in May. Prof Charles Warlow Edinburgh \u2022 How promising that the increasingly impossible goal of achieving a natural death has been so bravely tackled in Katie Engelhart\u2019s piece.  Several years ago when consulting a professor on a possible hernia repair, I was blithely informed that the body in question was no longer functioning as it should and that I had \u201clived too long\u201d. No solution to this was offered. At the time (then in my early 70s) I felt rather indignant. However, with increasing age and decrepitude, I have had to recognise the truth in his statement and with that comes a growing concern that the final decision does not rest with the individual, as it should, but with the medical profession. Why indeed should we be forced to suffer needlessly? A change in the law is long overdue. A really suitable subject for a referendum, I think. Pamela Attwood New Malden, London \u2022 Thank you for your excellent article on old age suicide, which should help to promote an understanding of the need for people coming to the end of their lives to be able to choose when they wish to die. But can I fill in a gap in the information you gave? The article talked about the Society for Old Age Rational Suicide (Soars), but didn\u2019t say that it is now called My Death My Decision (MDMD). As part of the Assisted Dying Coalition, it is now campaigning strongly for an assisted dying law that is not limited to terminally ill people. This should help to alleviate the very distressing situations in which people like Avril find themselves, and mean that they no longer have to go to such extraordinary lengths, on their own, to try and choose the time and manner of their death. Carolyn Sugden Birmingham \u2022 The law is designated for all of us at all times, not to serve the requirements of individuals, whatever their difficulties. The laws against killing protect the healthy majority; the removal of this law could put most elderly, disabled, depressed or simply deluded people under pressure to evaluate the efficacy of their lives, while not wanting to be a burden to their carers or loved ones. It is no coincidence that regular scrutiny of this fundamental, protective law has arisen in the era of state-of-the-art economic efficiency.

We have spent years being taught what we, as women, should do to keep ourselves safe. As 12-year-olds at an all-girls\u2019 secondary school, we were given a specific lesson in how to avoid attack. We were taught to carry a key poking out of our fists as we walk, to sit near the bus driver, to choose brightly lit streets. We were each given a rape alarm. My brothers attended the equivalent boys\u2019 school. There was no equivalent lesson. These are messages about personal safety that are often passed from woman to woman. They are well-intended and come from a place of care and love, but how come it is still so widely accepted in society that it is a woman\u2019s responsibility to prevent an attack? In the UK, one in four women will experience domestic abuse and one in five will experience sexual assault during her lifetime. The number of rape prosecutions is falling year-on-year despite a much greater rise in the number of cases being reported, according to the Rape Monitoring Group. While we teach women to adapt their lives to keep safe, there is little work being done to educate men against chauvinistic attitudes or aggressions, such as wolf-whistling, that make so many environments hostile for women. It\u2019s time that as a society, rather than teach women to live in fear, we address the attitudes, behaviour and violence that lie at the root of it. There is no comfort in this being a rare event.

Always a snazzy dresser, on that day in college in the 1960s, Fields, who has died aged 75, unpinned the Donald Duck badge attached to the lapel of his black velvet three-piece suit and stuck it through the canvas of the abstract painting he had been working on. It was a revelatory moment that led to a 50-year painting practice in which the artist blended the dayglo palette of cartoons with imagery from fashion and advertising. Mixed into these sharp, graphic compositions were art historical references to Dal\u00ed, Mondrian, Joan Mir\u00f3 and others. In Stumped, a 1976 painting now in the Arts Council collection, two elegant female mannequins, dressed in blue shoulderless tops and peach skirts, are shown embracing. Undermining this pop art sensibility, each figure has one arm missing and no head. On the left breast of one figure a Dal\u00ed-like eye is placed, on the other figure a small, Mondrian-esque colour grid is placed just above the waist. The figures in this work were more clothed than most. More typical is the cheekiness of Blonde With Strategically Placed Cushion (1970) or Study for Joie de Vivre (1978). In the latter an Audrey Hepburn-type figure, hand and scalp missing, exposes her left breast through her blue, shoulder-padded top. To the right, in the background, stands a male figure, similarly amputated, and nude but for a blue posing pouch, pubic hair overflowing. For all he learned at art school, however, Fields\u2019 real education, and fame, came from the fashionable milieu of late 60s and 70s London, where he was a regular at parties and fashion events, recognisable by his trademark quiff and penchant for eyebrow makeup. Friends and collaborators included Zandra Rhodes, Marc Bolan, John Maybury and Andrew Logan, at whose Alternative Miss World beauty pageant Fields was a dedicated attendee.     Clothing featuring art by Duggie Fields on sale at Dover Street Market in the West End of London. Photograph: Glenn Copus/Evening Standard/Rex/Shutterstock    Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, to Edna (nee Rosenthal) and Henry Field, Douglas grew up in the garrison town of Tidworth, where his father owned a large pharmacy. He recalled being fascinated with the packaging that lined the shelves, and, stored out the back, in the room in which Henry ran a sideline putting down sick pets, a collection of old posters, featuring glamorous pin-ups hawking pharmaceutical drugs. \u201cThese were by far the glossiest, the sexiest, the most seductive\u201d adverts he had ever seen, the artist recalled. The family moved to Hampshire in 1954 and the boy was educated at Andover grammar school. After the family moved once again, this time, to Borehamwood, in Hertfordshire, where Duggie attended the grammar school in Cowley Hill, he took advantage of his proximity to London to sneak into the capital, one of his cousins, Judy, taking him to a gay club called the Purple Pussycat on the Finchley Road, and the West End music venues then populating their bills with blues bands. One night, in a 50-person-capacity flea pit, he saw the Rolling Stones play. Their arty glamour immediately seduced him, and he abandoned plans of studying in Liverpool to move to London. Initially enrolling in an architecture course at the Regent Street Polytechnic, he was told that he would be better suited to Chelsea. It was sound advice \u2013 there he found the King\u2019s Road to be a \u201cparade of beautiful people\u201d. \u201cThere were visions on the street; amazing people came,\u201d he said. One such beauty was Syd Barrett, with whom Fields shared a flat in Earl\u2019s Court from graduation in 1968, the year the Pink Floyd singer was ousted from the band. Already known for his dapper dress, Fields\u2019 cult fashion status was confirmed when he was featured in Caterina Milinaire\u2019s Cheap Chic (1975), an immediate bible of DIY fashion. When Barrett left for a reclusive life in Cambridge in 1972, Fields turned the pop star\u2019s bedroom into an atelier, and stayed living in the same apartment until his death. The flat became a maximalist temple, a reflection of the all-encompassing nature of Fields\u2019 artistic vision, captured by Derek Jarman in the filmmaker\u2019s 1974 work At Home With Duggie Fields. Of his interest in fashion and design, Fields told Elephant Magazine last year: \u201cI don\u2019t see any separation between my art and life \u2026 I live inside a painting.\u201d He recreated Gerrit Rietveld\u2019s Red Blue Chair, only with oversized painter\u2019s palettes attached to the legs; his own work was printed on cushions, with paintings leaning against the walls and fashion magazines piled in every room. \u201cLess is less, more or less,\u201d he was fond of saying. \u201cIt\u2019s a concept I\u2019ve slowly evolved all my life.\u201d For an exhibition at the Modern Institute in Glasgow in 2018, the artist recreated his living quarters in the gallery. Among the objects on show was a cushion with Fields\u2019 painting of Alex from A Clockwork Orange on, the original painting commissioned by the film\u2019s director, Stanley Kubrick. It was one of many collaborations the artist embarked on. In 1983, sponsored by the cosmetics company Shiseido, Fields travelled to Tokyo to produce a show. Shiseido ran an extensive marketing campaign featuring his work, including self-portraits on television, billboard and subway advertising throughout the country. It made him hugely famous, and Fields would find himself mobbed on the street by teenage girls, the company\u2019s target market. In 2002, his painting Party On was featured in Transport for London\u2019s Platform for Art series. Five years later he walked the Paris runway for Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, having been muse for Rei Kawakubo\u2019s collection that season; in 1987, kiss curl intact and bedecked in gold makeup, he played Avarice in the music video for the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 It\u2019s a Sin. Art critics were often sniffy, however. In one notorious 1987 review Brian Sewell wrote that Fields was \u201ca painter of whom no one should take the slightest notice\u201d, whose work was only of interest to the \u201chomosexual mafia\u201d. Later reviewers claimed a \u201cwhiff of casual misogyny\u201d in the work. Before the Modern Institute show, Fields\u2019 last solo exhibition was at the Gallery Liverpool in 2012. The artist\u2019s institutional shows amounted to the Ikon Gallery, Birmingham (1980) and Spacex Gallery, Exeter (1982). From the 90s onwards Fields used his paintings to make digital animations, mostly shown on his personal website. The BFI showed them in 2016 as part of Flare, an LGBTIQ+ film festival. The artist was sanguine about this limited recognition, though. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in the art world per se,\u201d he said. \u201cI have always thought of myself as an outsider and not unhappily. I remember when I was a student, we weren\u2019t supposed to want to be in museums or admire them. We were supposed to be anti-bourgeois and bohemian.\u201d He is survived by his brother, Howard, and niece, Sara.   \u2022 Duggie Fields (Douglas Arthur Peter Field), artist, born 6 August 1945; died 7 March 2021", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Have Meghan and Harry moved the monarchy closer towards its end? If only | Jonathan Freedland", "full_article": "Will this be the moment? Will Meghan and Harry do to the monarchy what Diana threatened but never quite achieved, shaking the institution so severely it eventually collapses? Those who believe Britons should be able to choose their head of state have waited patiently for the crisis that finally undoes the House of Windsor, but this week they allowed themselves an excitement they had not known since the 1990s. Polling is stubbornly consistent, showing support for a republic flatlining at around 20%, but might the Oprah interview and all it revealed trigger a shift? Could this, at last, be it? The case for republican optimism begins with an acknowledgment that this latest twist is hardly unprecedented. On the contrary, each generation seems to have its own iteration of the same plotline, a tale of love and marriage revealing a cold, closed institution thwarting the happiness of its young. It was Edward and Mrs Simpson for my grandparents; Margaret and Group Captain Peter Townsend for my parents; Charles, Camilla and Diana for me \u2013 and now the Sussexes for my kids. The public splits on generational lines, the young shaking their fists at the palace as monarchists feel a tremor of fear, anxious that the public will finally turn on the institution and demand its abolition. Usually it comes to nothing but, says the republican optimist, this time is different. Harry and Meghan have introduced a new, radioactive element into the mix: race and racism. The coming generation will not tolerate that, just as they will not forgive the callous dismissal of a declared mental health problem. True, Diana made that latter complaint too, but attitudes to mental health have advanced since then. In this view, the Windsors have crossed two lines that, for younger Britons, must never be crossed \u2013 and that could destroy the public consent on which monarchy rests. The racism accusation is particularly lethal, because the conventional remedies are not available to royalty. They cannot promise to \u201cprioritise diversity\u201d or to ensure their personnel \u201cbetter reflect Britain in 2021\u201d because that\u2019s not how a hereditary monarchy works. It allocates its \u2013 and therefore our \u2013 top job by bloodline. The role is reserved for the members of a single white Protestant family.

We like to speak of inclusivity, but forget that the role of head of state is determined by genetic exclusivity. Meghan could have represented an answer of sorts to that, bringing some diversity to the family. Instead, republicans can feel relieved that the monarchy had a chance to deepen its support among black and mixed-race Britons \u2013 and blew it. What\u2019s more, the palace cannot comfort itself that this week was a one-off: the Sussex bombardment might well continue, with Netflix as the launching platform. Relevant too is the fact that the monarchy\u2019s prize asset is a single, mortal individual. Malcolm Turnbull, the former Australian prime minister who led the unsuccessful 1999 referendum campaign to remove the Queen as that country\u2019s head of state, told me this week of \u201cthe huge reservoir of respect and affection\u201d that exists for the monarch and which has long blocked the path to change. That\u2019s truer still in the UK, where Elizabeth serves as the last symbolic link to what is the foundational event of modern Britain \u2013 1940, our finest hour \u2013 and meets a deep need for constancy and continuity, connecting the present to an almost unrecognisable past. But the Queen will be 95 next month; the second Elizabethan era will one day draw to a close. Her success has been predicated on a fastidious neutrality and the mystique of silence, two qualities that her eldest son will not be able to replicate: we know where he stands because he\u2019s talked a lot. All of which allows republicans to expect a shift. And yet, even though I share their conviction that in a democracy we should elect our head of state, I\u2019m not hopeful that a breakthrough is imminent. First, there\u2019s the history. The Windsors have survived much greater challenges than an Oprah interview: Edward VIII abdicated and Diana ended up dead, the latter generating a wave of fury that engulfed the streets rather than Twitter. For the Mirror to call this week\u2019s events the \u201cworst royal crisis in 85 years\u201d shows nothing so much as forgetfulness. Second, revelations of family dysfunction don\u2019t undermine the monarchy so much as explain its enduring appeal. One of royalty\u2019s advantages over electing an aged eminence as president, Ireland-style, is that it provides a rolling soap opera, a perpetual source of gossip, human drama and distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s reality TV,\u201d says Turnbull. The dysfunction is part of its function. Royal rifts and scandal are not a bug; they\u2019re a feature. Which means republicans don\u2019t win when they rest the case against monarchy on the flaws of those who currently inhabit it. Far better to make the case in principle. In Australia, that\u2019s easy because the principle is so simple: Australia\u2019s head of state should be Australian. The case here \u2013 that Britain can never be democratic or equal when the top rung of our national ladder is in the permanent grip of a single family \u2013 is also strong, but it can rapidly sound abstract or dry, lost in the arid wastelands of \u201cconstitutional reform\u201d. This is the republican paradox: the exciting arguments don\u2019t work, the powerful ones are boring. Some reformers believe their moment will come when the Queen\u2019s reign ends. Once it\u2019s no longer about her, people will be receptive to the republican argument. That forgets, though, that the system allows no such interval for debate on the merits of Charles III. It will be: \u201cThe Queen is dead, long live the King\u201d. There\u2019s a reason the monarchy has stood as long as it has. For all the Windsors\u2019 glaring deficiencies, the odds remain stacked in their favour. Republicanism is a just cause \u2013 but, for now at least, it seems a lost one.

Researchers from the University of Liverpool and the National Centre for Social Research found that most gambling accounts lost relatively modest sums, but that firms make at least 70% of their revenues from the biggest losers. In sports betting, that proportion rises to 86%, with people in deprived areas more likely to go for longer-odds wagers with a lower prospect of success. Gamblers from the poorest areas were also more likely to lose money in online casinos, which the study found presented a particular risk of high-intensity play despite lower overall losses across all players. Nine out of ten online casino accounts either won money or lost less than \u00a3500 over the course of a year, but 164,000 lost more than \u00a3500 during a single session of play, and 47,000 people lost more than \u00a35,000 in a year. This group was disproportionately likely to come from deprived areas and to have lost their money on virtual slot machines, which carry a higher rate of addiction than most other gambling products. Slots accounted for more than half of losses above \u00a35,000 and 70% of sessions where someone played for three hours without a break. More than 14,000 accounts did this three times during the year, often at a rapid pace, although in practice this could have been a smaller number of people doing so more often, as the study could not factor in users holding various accounts. Three-quarters of slot accounts had \u201cspun\u201d the machines more than 30 times in a minute at some point. The maximum spin speed is set to be reduced to 24 times a minute. \u201cThis all reaffirms my thoughts that those most vulnerable are groomed and exploited by an industry entirely motivated by profit,\u201d said the Labour MP Carolyn Harris, who chairs a cross-party group advocating gambling reform. \u201cWe saw it with the clustering of bookies in deprived areas, when the FOBTs were a huge money-maker,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are seeing it now with online. How can we trust this industry to self-regulate when they have repeatedly shown themselves to be predatory and merciless in their pursuit of profit?\u201d Campaigners for tighter affordability checks on gamblers said the study showed that such restrictions would not curb most people\u2019s freedoms. Of accounts used to bet on sport, 85% lost less than \u00a3200, while 90% of gaming accounts either won money or lost less than \u00a3500 over the course of a year. \u201cThis confirms what we have known for a long time, that the vast majority of online gambling profits are coming from people losing more than they can afford,\u201d said Matt Zarb-Cousin of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. \u201cAffordability checks introduced for losses equivalent to \u00a3100 a month would apply to fewer than 5% of gamblers.\u201d The Betting &amp; Gaming Council, the industry lobby group, said gambling firms had improved controls since the study was undertaken. \u201cThere is growing evidence that recent improvements in standards are now starting to have an impact,\u201d it said.", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Football Index, the game\u2019s \u2018stock market\u2019, has licence suspended", "full_article": "The Gambling Commission has suspended the operating licence of Football Index, the self-styled \u201cstock market of football\u201d, a few hours after the beleaguered betting company announced on Thursday that it had suspended \u201ctrading\u201d on its platform.

His family described him as \u201ca loving brother and father, caring and genuine\u201d. \nHe was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to Luton police station on 4 November 2013. Briggs died about two hours later at Luton &amp; Dunstable hospital as a result of \u201camphetamine intoxication in association with prone restraint and prolonged struggling\u201d, with a secondary cause of heart disease, the senior coroner Emma Whitting has previously said. \nHis family said the fact that the inquest, which began on 4 January 2021, had taken seven years to complete compounded their grief and distress over his loss. \nThe 10 members of the jury were asked to consider findings of unlawful killing and neglect. They rejected unlawful killing and found neglect. \nBrigg\u2019s mother, Margaret, said: \u201cSeven and a half years ago, my life changed for ever when my son Leon was cruelly and brutally taken away. On this day his children lost a much-loved and devoted father. During this inquest we have heard evidence that has convinced me that Leon was unlawfully killed by the police. This should have been the conclusion today. \n\u201cHe committed no crime and yet he was restrained face down on the floor, with force used against him, and he was shackled. We think that Leon\u2019s race was a factor in the way he was treated by the police. He was treated as someone who posed a threat rather than someone in need of help.\u201d  \nThe jury found \u201ca series of omissions and failures\u201d by Bedfordshire police and East of England ambulance service. \nThe ambulance service acknowledged a series of failings before the jury began its deliberations, including a failure to assess Briggs, communication failures and a failure to recognise and treat Briggs as a medical emergency. \nThe jury was asked to answer 40 questions, and in their answers they identified multiple failings. They found that the use of force on Briggs in the street, failure to recognise that he had become a medical emergency, failure to do a proper handover when Briggs arrived at Luton police station, failure to realise that he was not medically fit to be detained, and failure to monitor him appropriately more than minimally contributed to his death. It found that inappropriate weight or pressure was applied to Briggs. \nThe jury also found that a psychostimulant-induced psychotic disorder and heart disease more than minimally contributed to Briggs\u2019 death. They also found that police officers had believed it was necessary to use force on Briggs and that the use of force on Briggs in the circumstances was reasonable. \nThe inquest heard evidence from Briggs\u2019 mother about the deterioration in his mental health in the months and weeks before his death, and his family\u2019s mounting concern about this. He had agreed to go to hospital to seek help on the day he died. \n \n  \n  \n  Margaret Briggs. \n  Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo \n  \n \nOn the day of his death, 4 November 2013, police were called after Briggs was witnessed behaving strangely, walking and skipping along the street, moving in and out of shops and weaving in and out of traffic. \nAt about 2pm that day he was restrained on his front in a prone position in the street in Luton, at the junction of Marsh Road and Willow Way. His hands were handcuffed behind his back and his legs were tied with straps. \nVideo footage does not clearly show this restraint. However, Briggs can be seen being carried face down into a police van. \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nA second piece of footage then shows him at the police station at about 2.25pm where he can be heard repeatedly screaming \u201cno\u201d. He is seen being placed face down in a police cell and the handcuffs and leg restraints are removed. Soon afterwards he falls silent. Police officers can be heard asking if he is all right. \nThree minutes later the cell door was opened and then an ambulance was called. He was taken to Luton &amp; Dunstable hospital at about 3pm and pronounced dead at 4.14pm. \nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (now the Independent Office for Police Conduct, or IOPC) referred the case to the Crown Prosecution Service in March 2016 to consider manslaughter charges. In 2018 the CPS said no further action would be taken. In February 2020, Bedfordshire police were due to carry out a gross misconduct hearing against various officers involved in the incident. \nThere were allegations that three police officers had breached professional standards concerning use of force and that five officers had breached standards relating to their duties and responsibilities. However, Bedfordshire police said they would not present any evidence against their officers, so the IOPC had to withdraw the directions of misconduct and the hearing did not go ahead. \nThe deputy chief constable of Bedfordshire police, Trevor Rodenhurst, said: \u201cThe jury has today identified a number of significant failings by the police which contributed to the death of Mr Briggs, and for this we are truly sorry. \n\u201cThe attending officers chose to restrain him so he could be taken to a police custody suite, which was a recognised place of safety, where he could be properly assessed. By the time it became apparent he was a medical emergency it was too late to save him, despite their concerted efforts.\u201d \nAn East of England ambulance service spokesperson said they apologised for shortcomings in the medical assessment of Briggs. They said: \u201cMuch work has taken place since this sad case to better support and treat patients in a mental health crisis, including the introduction of a dedicated mental health street triage team in the area, and we will review and act on the coroner\u2019s findings to ensure that any further lessons are learned.\u201d  \nAnita Sharma, the head of casework at Inquest, who has worked closely with the family, said: \u201cThis damning conclusion is an important recognition of the seriousness of the system-wide failures. The police will say that seven years on, things have changed. Why then are black men still subject to disproportionate use of force by police? Why are they more likely to die after police contact, particularly when in a mental health crisis?

A technology hub adding cinematic presentation to moments of national crisis. But military and intelligence experts say that while the plans may be attractive to politicians, they risk being ineffective unless accompanied by an improved emergency response system that was absent at the start of the pandemic. Due for completion this summer, the situation room is an addition to the underground Cobra briefing rooms, a cramped suite of offices where politicians, military, spy and police chiefs can gather to make decisions in a crisis, ranging from a deadly terror attack to widespread flash-flooding. Politicians and advisers have long complained about Cobra\u2019s supporting technology. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly less glamorous than any Hollywood depiction.

Only one picture of a Cobra room exists, showing a windowless boardroom with three digital clocks and a large screen divided into eight. It was enough to form part of a scathing blog from Dominic Cummings, formerly Boris Johnson\u2019s chief aide, written just before he went into government in June 2019.

There has clearly been no attempt to learn from our best examples about how to use the room as a tool,\u201d he wrote. Cummings left government abruptly in December, but such sentiments \u2013 that bigger screens, interactive maps and large data dashboards can act as a basis for improved decision making \u2013 are widespread at senior levels.

Photograph: Xinhua/Rex/Shutterstock    At one Cobra meeting during the Ebola crisis several years ago, when David Cameron was in power, it became impossible to hear from either the then foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, who was in Washington, or the UK\u2019s ambassador on the ground. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Cameron quipped, according to one Whitehall veteran. \u201cWe\u2019re making lots of great decisions anyway.\u201d Former senior Whitehall insiders say that while the upgrade has been billed as being at the heart of Boris Johnson\u2019s integrated review of defence and foreign policy, due out on Tuesday, in fact it dates back to decisions made under Theresa May. \u201cThis has been planned for years and been tacked on to the review,\u201d the former official said. Donald Trump was able to watch the US raid on the compound of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from the White House in 2019, although what was shown to him was overhead surveillance footage with no audio \u2013 prompting questions as to how the former president could claim the Isis leader had died \u201cwhimpering, crying and screaming all the way.\u201d Ben Barry, a retired British army brigadier and senior fellow at the Institute of International Strategic Studies, said video was often a distraction. \u201cHaving a screen that shows drone footage leads to decision-makers in the room getting overly fixated on the footage, when you want them to sit back and think strategically.\u201d In the US, special forces no longer supply helmet camera footage in real time to command centres, partly to prevent backseat driving. The UK maintains a distinction between in-principle decisions that are taken by politicians and operational decisions for military, police or other emergency services. Another question is how good is the information coming into a Cobra meeting, which often takes place when a situation is in flux, particularly during a terror attack. \u201cIn the early periods of a crisis, the problem is actually knowing reliably what is happening,\u201d the former Downing Street adviser said. Part of the situation room upgrade is an enhanced team of \u201cwatchkeepers\u201d, whose job it is to monitor, collate and, in a crisis, hand out information about what is happening, culled from a mixture of social media, news reports and other public and private data with the help of special monitoring algorithms. They create what is known as the Common Recognised Information Picture (CRIP), an agreed statement of facts, used partly to prevent politicians arguing needlessly about what is happening on the ground when key decisions have to be taken, usually in 45 minutes or less. Barry argued that this too is insufficient if ministers and officials do not engage in regular practice exercises, and if government fails to shift to crisis mode effectively in response to a slow-building crisis, such as an emerging pandemic. \u201cLast March many parts of government failed to respond properly.

An update from the Parker review, a government-backed report into ethnic diversity in boardrooms of stock market-listed companies, showed that 81 FTSE 100 firms had now met the voluntary target for \u201cone by 2021\u201d, up from 52 last year. However, 19 companies, including the housebuilder Persimmon and the asset manager M&amp;G have just nine months to meet the minimum standards set out by the review. Three of the 19 firms provided no data on their diversity levels, including Just Eat and the retailer Next. Karan Bilimoria, the president of the CBI and its first black and minority ethnic head, said: \u201cThis is an important milestone, but not job done. Companies need to keep up momentum with actions to improve ethnic diversity at every level, developing talented future leaders from across society. We need to see those last few firms do what the large majority have done already, and end the all-white boardroom.\u201d The Parker review, which launched in 2017, gave FTSE 100 firms until the end of 2021 to appoint at least one non-white board-level director. The same target was set for the FTSE 250 companies, but with a deadline of 2024. While the Parker review committee praised the \u201csignificant progress\u201d made by firms in the past 12 months during the pandemic, the total number of BAME directors holding top board positions was still strikingly low. People from BAME backgrounds hold just 124, or 12%, of the 998 director positions across the FTSE 100 index. That is up from 98, or 9.7%, of 1,011 positions last year.

That is despite calls for greater representation of people from black backgrounds after the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, sparked by the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police last year. The Parker review has not revealed the proportion of black representation in its own statistics, but Sir John Parker said the review would request that data from the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 in future.  Parker said a lot had changed since he appointed a BAME director to the board of Babcock more than 20 years ago, and brought Dipesh Shah on board as a non-executive in the late 1990s, but there was a lot more to do to improve gender and ethnic diversity.

Of the monumental 160-metre-long Parthenon frieze, executed by the master sculptor Phidias at the behest of Pericles, more than 80 metres are exhibited in the British Museum. Fifty metres of the 115-block frieze is displayed in the Acropolis Museum, purpose-built to house the treasures at the foot of the masterpiece. Highlighting the importance of the issue for his centre-right government, Mitsotakis proposed shortly after assuming office that treasures that had never been shown abroad before be exhibited in London in exchange for the marbles being returned to Athensthis year. \u201cI don\u2019t think [Britain] should be fighting a losing battle. Eventually this is going to be a losing battle \u2026 At the end of the day there is going to be mounting pressure on this issue,\u201d he told the Observer, referring to repeated surveys showing the vast majority of Britons expressing support for the Greek cause. As a monument of cultural significance globally, the Acropolis did not solely belong to Greece, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a monument of global cultural heritage. But if you really want to see the monument in its unity you have to see what we call the Parthenon sculptures in situ \u2026 it\u2019s a question of uniting the monument.\u201d In a move that some believed might embarrass Britain, France agreed to return to Athens part of the frieze that the Louvre had long regarded as one of the most precious pieces in its possession, in return for the museum being loaned spectacular Greek bronzes that had never been seen before. The positive response, made with unexpected alacrity, came after Mitsotakis lodged the request in July 2019 during talks with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, on his first official visit to Paris. Johnson described himself as \u201ca keen scholar of Greek history\u201d in the Ta Nea interview.

Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    But while extolling the contribution of ancient Greece to western civilisation and emphasising \u201cBritain\u2019s crucial role\u201d in the 1821 Greek war of independence, the prime minister avoided any mention of the antiquities being loaned to Athens. Instead, he told the paper the UK was focused on deepening ties with \u201ca peace-loving international partner\u201d that the British politician, a former foreign secretary, said played an important role in Europe, Nato and the \u201cpivotal region\u201d connecting Europe to the Middle East. Aside from boosting a trade relationship worth \u20ac6.5bn \u2013 \u201clast year over \u20ac1.5m-worth of British lemons were exported to Greece\u201d \u2013 he said his government was also working to protect the rights of thousands of British nationals who had made the country their home. Johnson\u2019s own father, Stanley, who owns a villa overlooking the Aegean, is among them. \u201cThis is the beginning of a new partnership with our European friends, one that builds on our common bonds of friendship and cooperation, but with the UK acting with an independent voice to speak on the things that matter to us,\u201d he said. \u201c2021 is of course a significant year for Greece and a very exciting time to be reinvigorating our relationship with the Greek people.\u201d In 1816 the British Museum acquired the sculptures from the then bankrupt Elgin, who, as Britain\u2019s ambassador to the Sublime Porte, had ordered them to be torn down from the Parthenon after purportedly receiving a permit from the Ottoman forces occupying Athens at the time. Reacting to Johnson\u2019s remarks, the Greek culture minister threw down the gauntlet, saying Athens could provide \u201cthe necessary documentary evidence\u201d to prove that the British Museum possessed the sculptures illegally. In written comments she said: \u201cUpon careful review of the statements by prime minister Johnson, it is clear that he has not been properly informed \u2026 of the new historical data regarding Greece\u2019s occupation by the Ottomans, which show there was never a legitimate acquisition of the Parthenon sculptures by Lord Elgin, and therefore neither by the British Museum. \u201cFor Greece, the British Museum does not have legitimate ownership, or possession, of the sculptures. The Parthenon, as a symbol of Unesco and western civilisation, reflects universal values.

They stayed up on the final day courtesy of a stoppage-time winner at Brentford but the sequel to last season\u2019s miraculous escape might yet trump that climax. With 11 games to go, sixth belongs to Barnsley, a forward-thinking, data-driven club with a low-cost, high-pressing formula. Barnsley\u2019s style has revolved around suffocating and sapping opponents for a few years but, nine months ago, the landscape looked markedly different. \u201cThere was not a lot of sleep,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cThe goal scored by Clarke Oduor to keep us in the division changes the stars. That really galvanised everyone involved because it proved that yes, we took a lot of risks last season by starting the youngest team in the division and having the lowest budget, and we struggled at times, mightily. But we have been able to give them time to grow into the group you see now and this is the reward.\u201d   Related: 'We've surprised ourselves': Paunovic puts top flight in Reading's sights | Ben Fisher    Faith in a Moneyball-like model is yielding results at Barnsley, where Billy Beane, who transformed Oakland Athletics\u2019 trajectory with the use of statistical analysis, is a shareholder. They have won seven of their past eight matches and are unbeaten in 10 before visiting Bournemouth on Saturday. Fans have not clunked through Oakwell\u2019s turnstiles for 12 months but might they return to the terraces supporting a Premier League club? Val\u00e9rien Isma\u00ebl, who took charge of the club in October when Barnsley had three points from their first six matches, affords himself a wry smile. \u201cWe have three games until the international break and after we will see a clear picture in the table and maybe we will see what\u2019s going on for us, if we can push for more or if it was a nice trip,\u201d Ismael says. \u201cWe deserve to be here, we don\u2019t have any big pressure and must stay hungry. We want to continue to move forward to finish this great season as high as we can.\u201d     At 26, Cauley Woodrow is one of Barnsley\u2019s oldest players. Photograph: Malcolm Bryce/ProSports/Shutterstock    Barnsley have a \u201csoft cap\u201d on signing players over the age of 24 (at 26, top scorer Cauley Woodrow was the oldest player in their starting lineup in midweek) and target undervalued players from the lower leagues and across Europe who can develop into assets. Metrics such as PPDA (passes per defensive action) detail the intensity with which a team defends and can help recruit players accustomed to Barnsley\u2019s gegenpressing philosophy. \u201cIf we look at a player who is extremely talented, and his goals and assists are through the roof but he is not able to sustain an element of pressing and defending high up the field for 90 minutes, that is a red flag for us,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cThere are lots of clubs that use data and have brought in analysts to push in this direction ... but at Barnsley it\u2019s the principle, it\u2019s the root of what we are doing. There are clubs that say, \u2018We need to bring it in as an ingredient\u2019 but here it is the bedrock. Like Brentford in a way and Red Bull on a global scale, data is the first thing that wipes out the noise for us.\u201d There are perhaps more parallels between the Red Bull franchise, which owns clubs in Austria, Brazil, Germany, and the United States, and Barnsley\u2019s royal redbrick facade and the wooden seats of the West Stand than at first glance. This week the Chinese-American billionaire Chien Lee, whose Pacific Media Group consortium bought Barnsley in 2017, added the Danish club Esbjerg to its stable of clubs, which includes Oostende, who are flying high in the Belgian First Division after finishing second-bottom last season, and Nancy, who have made strides in Ligue 2 since the takeover in January. Both are run day to day by Gauthier Ganaye, the former Barnsley chief executive. \u201cIt is on a smaller scale than Red Bull, but the idea and the intent of the ownership group was to create this ecosystem where each club is run with this financial model and recruitment model,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cRed Bull as a global club, and a global brand, their approach has been unique on several fronts and to try and emulate what they are doing, on and off the field, would only make sense. Brentford have set the standard in the Championship with how they are able to, on a smaller budget and with fewer resources than some competitors, steadily climb by finding talent that is undervalued and underused, and move those pieces on and bring new ones in.\u201d Barnsley are at pains to avoid talk of the P-words \u2013 promotion and the Premier League \u2013 but are quick to spy potential, with Callum Styles, who joined from Bury as an 18-year-old after scouts tracked him in League Two, a prime example. Styles has flourished in midfield and at left wing-back and, on the opposite flank, Callum Brittain has shone since signing from MK Dons in October.

Photograph: Simon Dael/BPI/Shutterstock    In January, Liam Kitching followed Ethan Pinnock, now of Brentford, in signing from Forest Green, while Conor Chaplin, a nippy striker, was identified while breaking through at Portsmouth before signing from Coventry. Not every signing is a triumph but the pathway is clear. \u201cThey have a track record of pushing young players into the first team and that appealed,\u201d says Styles. \u201cIt was the right decision in terms of not getting lost as a youngster.\u201d On Wednesday, Isma\u00ebl again played his party trick: a triple change before the hour mark to replenish his attack as if a Formula One car refuelling. \u201cExactly,\u201d says the Frenchman, who has made more substitutions (139) than any other team this season. \u201cMy concern is: how can I keep the intensity high throughout the 90 minutes? That is why I was very delighted that we would have five substitutes [this season] because the front three are very important to our philosophy.\u201d     The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.   Barnsley\u2019s use of data has been accelerated since Beane came on board but the approach was the baby of the late former owner Patrick Cryne, whose son, James, owns a minority stake and heads the club\u2019s recruitment operation. Incredibly, in a division awash with overspend, the club\u2019s record signing remains the \u00a31.5m they paid for Georgi Hristov in 1997. \u201cWe face teams week in, week out that have eight, nine, maybe sometimes 15 times the budget of what we are working with,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cI think that is another reason why we have to stick to our true north in the path that we are on with the data because if we go outside the lane and say: \u2018OK, with this one player we are going to go beyond our means,\u2019 then the dam breaks.

Just as bitcoin created the ability to spend and save a sort of digital money without any centralised authority, so too do NFTs allow for pictures, videos, music, or anything else that can be digitally represented, to be wrapped up in a format that can be traded, stored or authenticated without needing to turn to a gatekeeper. \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    Non-fungible tokens, known as NFTs, are electronic identifiers confirming a digital collectible is real by recording the details on a digital ledger or database known as a blockchain. The tokens have swept the online collecting world and are an offshoot of the boom in cryptocurrencies.\n    They\u2019re used to prove that an item is one of a kind and are aimed at solving a problem central to digital collectibles: how to claim ownership of something that can be easily and endlessly duplicated.\n    Musician and artist Grimes sold a collection of digital artworks for almost $6m (\u00a34.3m) using the technology, while Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO, put his first ever tweet \u2013 \u201cjust setting up my twttr\u201d \u2013 up for online auction as an NFT, with bids reaching as high as $2.5m.\n    But while the very technology of NFTs prevents them from being duplicated without permission, there\u2019s nothing inherent to the sector that controls who can make an NFT in the first place \u2013 a fact that has caused dismay to some artists, who have found their work ending up in the \u201ccontrol\u201d of people who had nothing to do with its creation.\n    There has also been criticism of the environmental impact caused by the computer processing power needed to validate the blockchain, a charge also levelled at cryptocurrencies.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nOnce an NFT is created, it can be digitally traced for ever. And unlike a simple image file, for instance, an NFT can\u2019t be duplicated, giving it a similar cachet to an original artwork, and enabling the sort of transactions that have seen the field garner mainstream interest over the last month. \nBut while the very technology of NFTs prevents them from being duplicated without permission, there\u2019s nothing inherent to the sector that controls who can make an NFT in the first place \u2013 a fact that has caused dismay to some artists, who have found their work ending up in the \u201ccontrol\u201d of people who had nothing to do with its creation. \nSimon St\u00e5lenhag, the Swedish illustrator whose Tales from the Loop has become an Amazon Prime original, is one. On Wednesday, he found that one of his artworks had been turned into a \u201cMarbleCard\u201d, a type of NFT that allows users to make and trade tokens representing web pages. \u201cI guess we must do a daily google if we\u2019ve been NFT:d from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks Silicon Valley!\u201d \nMarbleCard isn\u2019t the only NFT service that makes it trivial to \u201ctokenise\u201d other people\u2019s content. Another, Tokenized Tweets, lets users turn any tweet into a tradable digital asset simply by sending a message on the social network, and artworks posted to the site have been a popular target for tokenisation. \u201cNow people can sell your tweets all without your permission,\u201d warned the artist RJ Palmer, whose own images were tokenised without his permission. \nEmma Price, an artist and designer based in Margate, cited Palmer\u2019s experience, as well as the enormous environmental damage of the cryptocurrency sector, in taking a stand against NFTs. \u201cVery quickly it became clear that a lot of non-creative, often faceless, entities were jumping in to exploit all manner of ways to create and distribute NFTs, with little care afforded to an originator\u2019s ownership of a digital item. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no oversight here, and seemingly no understanding of or respect for copyright. The unscrupulous way that it allows artists to be ripped off is maddening.\u201d \nWhile NFT systems that encourage users to tokenise web pages or tweets they do not own were always likely to invite trouble, even more conventional systems that allow for artists to tokenise their own works have caused controversy. The Wu Tang Clan\u2019s foray into the area last week was aborted after the artist Kevin Alexander objected that the animation was similar to an artwork he had posted online in 2013. \nSometimes, the boundary blurring is deliberate, as with the Burned Banksy NFT. This token, which sold for around \u00a3300,000, is an image of a Banksy print titled Morons, which was sold in an edition of 500. But the specific print that has been tokenised, number 325, was publicly burned as the token was minted, a move the anonymous creators argue \u201cmoved the value of the physical piece on to the NFT\u201d. \n \n  \n  \n  The burning of the Banksy print Morons. \n  Photograph: Burnt Banksy \n  \n \nEven for those digital artists who view 20th-century copyright norms as outdated, though, the trend is raising concern. \u201cIn a sense, the NFT sector should be more attentive to what is offending and upsetting people \u2013 especially the artists whose work is attracting interest to their field \u2013 than strictly what is technically or legally possible,\u201d says Parker Higgins, a New-York-based artist and activist who has campaigned for copyright reform. \n\u201cIn many other creative areas, norms and customs are more influential than the specific contours of copyright law, where the price of transgression is not necessarily a lawsuit but still very real.

Once upon a time it was France who were les grandes \u00e9nigmes; now it is red rose supporters who are shrugging with palms upturned and wondering which England team will turn up. It is a long time since Les Bleus arrived at Twickenham with a better balanced lineup or, more ominously still, one with such clear potential for further improvement. Maybe their hosts will be roused into action and extend France\u2019s dismal Six Nations record across the Channel since the topsy-turvy day in 2005 when, from 17-6 down at half-time, Dimitri Yachvili\u2019s boot secured an unlikely 18-17 victory. Rather more likely is that France \u2013 recent Covid-19 disruption permitting \u2013 will underline the widening gap between the teams in terms of front foot confidence and genuine attacking elan.   Related: Max Malins handed a belated chance to shine for England in Six Nations    A glorious repeat of 1991, when France launched one of the most daring raids seen at Twickenham from behind their own posts to set up Philippe Saint-Andr\u00e9\u2019s famous try at the other end, is asking too much but, 30 years on, the intoxicating scent of Gallic ambition hangs in the air again. Not since Thomas Castaign\u00e8de twinkled so brightly outside Philippe Carbonneau in the brilliant 51-0 grand slam demolition of Wales at Wembley in 1998 have two French half-backs headed to London for a championship fixture accompanied by such high expectations. Everyone already knows about Antoine Dupont, dubbed the \u201cmini Jonah Lomu\u201d by the former French hooker Benjamin Kayser this week. The Toulouse scrum-half, still only 24, has it all: the strength, the daring, the acceleration and, increasingly, the presence that comes with being recognised as the best No 9 in the world. Slightly less attention, for now, has been paid to Dupont\u2019s outrider, Matthieu Jalibert. By the time the 2023 World Cup comes around, the Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles fly-half could also be the most influential 10 on the planet. Listen, for example, to this assessment from Jalibert\u2019s one-time Bordeaux head coach, Rory Teague, who was also England\u2019s skills coach under Eddie Jones in 2017. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a very interesting player there,\u201d says Teague, who remains in touch with his former charge. \u201cThere were elements of his mental resilience that reminded me of Owen Farrell: he\u2019s very tenacious, very driven and demanding of high standards. Yet he also has that French flair, that bit of stardust you don\u2019t often see. His change of speed, his ability to scan a defence, see a gap early and exploit it is pretty impressive. It\u2019s great to see how he\u2019s evolving.\u201d Jalibert, 22, also seems to have timed his arrival on the international scene just right. Look around the world and running fly-halves are increasingly back in vogue, as noted by the Scotland coach, Gregor Townsend. \u201cI see fly-halves who are runners being more effective in the game than ever before,\u201d Townsend told BBC 5 live, citing Beauden Barrett and Richie Mo\u2019unga in New Zealand and Scotland\u2019s own Finn Russell. \u201cThese are players who attack the line. At stand-off you\u2019ve got the first opportunity to take on the defence. The more you pass the ball, the more a good defence might close you down but if you\u2019ve got that running instinct it\u2019s going to serve you much better than maybe it did five or 10 years ago.\u201d With the gifted Romain Ntamack back from injury on the bench, Virimi Vakatawa restored to the midfield and Ga\u00ebl Fickou adding more understated class and defensive organisation, it makes for an intriguing contrast with England\u2019s more conservative selectorial approach and stilted attacking efforts in the tournament to date. A shortage of ball and a spiralling penalty count has clearly done them no favours but generally England\u2019s first instinct has been to kick first and think afterwards.     France\u2019s Antoine Dupont (right), in action against Italy last month, has been called a \u2018mini Jonah Lomu\u2019 by the former French hooker Benjamin Kayser. Photograph: Insidefoto/LightRocket/Getty Images    Harsh on George Ford and Owen Farrell, perhaps, but France appear to be much further down the boulevard towards coaching\u2019s holy grail: a team capable of making massive dents up front, the set-piece included, threatening around the rucks as well as out wide and of kicking smartly out of hand. \u201cThe French do like to play on instinct and are probably less pragmatic, but that side of their game is developing,\u201d cautions Teague, who also worked with Dupont\u2019s understudy Baptiste Serin during his time in Bordeaux. \u201cThey like to keep the ball alive and play to space; taking the ball into contact and going to the floor is not their first thought. It\u2019s more: \u2018How can I manipulate a defender, can I take him on and keep the ball alive?\u2019\u201d With Shaun Edwards having also instilled more organisational steel, Charles Ollivon\u2019s leadership style proving popular and Brice Dulin usually safe and secure beneath the high ball, it adds up to a mighty challenge for an England side who squeaked home \u2013 slightly fortuitously \u2013 in sudden death extra time when they met a weakened French team in the final of the Autumn Nations Cup in December. With the same referee, Andrew Brace, in charge again, the 14 penalties England conceded in Cardiff will doubtless ensure the official monitors the hosts more closely at the breakdown this time. It is England\u2019s belief, nevertheless, that they can easily cut out the handful of silly penalties that cost them against Wales and Jones is in no hurry to sit back and coo at the exciting runners heading England\u2019s way. \u201cYou guys like to talk about attack all the time but we know that Test rugby is won by defence. If our defence is right that will feed opportunities for our attack.\u201d     The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.   The problem with that pragmatic analysis is that France, admittedly having played one game fewer, have conceded just two tries to England\u2019s seven so far. It is easy to see Luke Cowan-Dickie bringing close-range intent and bristle while Maro Itoje has a point to prove but England will also require Kyle Sinckler at tighthead and Billy Vunipola at No 8 to underline their Lions-quality credentials. In short, Jones\u2019s side will need to deliver comfortably their best performance of the tournament to halt France\u2019s push towards a first Six Nations title since 2010. \u201cWe\u2019ve always known France are a sleeping giant of world rugby but now they\u2019ve woken up,\u201d says Teague.

In Breton artist Xavier Marabout\u2019s Herg\u00e9-Hopper mashupsTintin is variously painted into Hopper\u2019s Road and Houses, scratching his head as he greets a woman in a car; looking disgruntled in a version of Hopper\u2019s Cape Cod Evening, 1939; and kissing a girl in a car, in a spin on Hopper\u2019s Queensborough Bridge, 1913.

It is indeed strange to realise that women are absent from many comic-strip stories.

Marabout told the Guardian that his work echoed the historian Christian Jacob\u2019s belief that \u201cthere is no cultural transmission without reappropriation\u201d. \u201cThis is exactly what that I do in my work as an artist. I revisit my own culture by merging, or mashing up, different cultural worlds, and giving them meaning. Because some universes speak to each other in secret,\u201d he said. As well as Herg\u00e9 and Hopper, his fusions include Batman and Klimt, Picasso and the creations of cartoonist Tex Avery. \u201cIn my Herg\u00e9 Hopper series, I imagined a romantic life for Tintin in the intimate and voyeuristic universe of the American painter. Because frankly, the universe of Herg\u00e9 is terribly virile and women are completely absent,\u201d Marabout said. \u201cWho can imagine a world without women? So my paintings where Tintin is staged with pin-ups are funny, but behind that I wanted to show that the two universes were perfect to meet. The mystery of Hopper paintings responding to the Tintin mystery.\u201d \u201cI defend my right to parody which is part of freedom of expression,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is a fundamental law in our democracy. I hope that justice will prove me right, but I am still worried, because we are going through a difficult period where freedoms are declining every day.\u201d Moulinsart did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Sports quiz of the week: Rangers, bogeys and a world champion boxer ", "full_article": " \n  \n  \n   \n    \n     Rangers have been crowned champions of Scotland for the first time in 10 years.

In the first month since leaving the EU on terms agreed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government, the Office for National Statistics said goods exports to the bloc fell by \u00a35.6bn, while imports fell by 28.8%, or \u00a36.6bn. Exports of food and live animals to the EU, which includes seafood and fish, were the hardest hit by Brexit, collapsing by 63.6% in January. This reflected heavier disruption and additional checks for consignments from this sector that prompted furious protests from the fishing industry. However, food and live animals account for only 7% of total UK exports.   UK trade data   After stockpiling and disruption at UK borders in the run-up to the Brexit transition, the decline also came as the economy shrank the most in January since the first wave of the pandemic, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling 2.9% from the level in December. The ONS said the January performance was the worst since monthly records began in 1997, as a 1.7% rise in non-EU trade, worth \u00a3200m, failed to make up for the plunge in cross-border activity with the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner. Overall, global UK exports and imports fell by about a fifth. Although January\u2019s GDP figure represents the biggest contraction since the first lockdown almost a year ago, analysts had forecast a bigger decline of 4.9%, suggesting that businesses and households adapted better to harsh restrictions than during the first wave of the pandemic, when GDP fell by more than 20% in April 2020.   UK GDP data   Experts said the scale of the decline in January trade was unlikely to be permanent because there was evidence companies stockpiled goods before the Brexit deadline, meaning they would not need to send as many shipments as usual in January. The decline was lower than a 68% plunge anticipated by road hauliers, while the ONS said there were signs trade had started to pick up at the end of the month.

GW       3.07pm GMT    US consumer sentiment hits one-year high    Just in: US consumer sentiment has hit its highest level since the pandemic began, according to the University of Michigan\u2019s latest poll. Surveys of Consumers chief economist, Richard Curtin, says vaccine optimism and the new $1.9trn stimulus package both lifted optimism among Americans this month.  Consumer sentiment rose in early March to its highest level in a year due to the growing number of vaccinations as well as the widely anticipated passage of Biden\u2019s relief measures. The gains were widespread across all socioeconomic subgroups and all regions, although the largest monthly gains were concentrated among households in the bottom third of the income distribution as well as those aged 55 or older. Over the past fifty years, the key age group that consistently led recoveries, but was the last age group to indicate a pending recession, was consumers under age 35 (see the featured chart).

Fundamentally important sectors within the food and drink industry for Scotland were among the hardest hit, they point out, with fish and shellfish, Scotland\u2019s largest food export category, down by \u201ca crippling 83%\u201d.  James Withers, CEO of Scotland Food &amp; Drink, said Brexit was \u201cright at the heart\u201d of the collapse in food exports to the EU.  \u201cThere is no sugar-coating these statistics, they are grim. We know Covid has reduced demand and there was stockpiling of products before the end of the year, however, right at the heart of this trade collapse is Brexit and the creation of huge, new, non-tariff trade barriers with our biggest export market. \u201cThis simply can\u2019t be talked away as a Covid issue. The crash in UK trade has not been seen in sales to non-EU markets, despite it being a global pandemic. Also, we did not see a fall like this at any point during the first lockdown. \u201cThe financial damage to our seafood industry is particularly stark. A fall of over 80% in what is the UK\u2019s biggest food export has brought a crisis to a sector reeling from the worst trading year in memory. You can\u2019t stockpile fresh fish and shellfish, so that has not been a factor at all in these figures.  Withers also fears that it will be hard to improve the position for domestic exporters, now that the UK has delayed its own import checks, making it easier to bring goods into the country.  \u201cI do expect to see an uplift in the February and March figures, but the trade barriers now created are real and costly. The so-called teething problems are still with us and have cost the industry tens of millions so far. This has to act as a catalyst to open negotiations with the EU to recognise aligned food standards and reduce the red tape burden. Without that, these trade figures will never recover to anything like the levels before. EU supply chains will permanently restructure, and UK businesses and jobs will lose out.   \u201cOf course, getting the EU to the table may now be much more difficult given that none of our EU counterparts will feel any real border friction until the end of the year. They will enjoy a grace period on border checks so wrongly denied to UK exporters. The Brexit dividend thus far has turned out to be a huge competitive disadvantage for Scottish food exporters.\u201d      BREXIT TRADE: The UK/EU trade figures for Jan 2021 are out.

Sterling has dropped by over a cent against the US dollar, to $1.388. It\u2019s also down a third of a eurocent against the euro to \u20ac1.164. January\u2019s tumble in UK-EU trade doesn\u2019t feel very positive for the pound. But the main move seems to be investors piling back into the US dollar.  The yield, or interest rate, on US Treasury bills (government debt) has risen again, suggesting inflation worries are causing jitters again.  Neil Jones, head of FX sales at Mizuho Bank, explains (via Reuters):  The weaker pound is largely a function of higher yields pushing the U.S. dollar into positive territory. \u201cThe market is looking to hedge inflation fears again by buying U.S. dollars.\u201d      Pressuring equities is the resumption of the upward move in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield which hit 1.6% earlier this morning following President Biden\u2019s stimulus package. @ChrisJVersace and @EllesEconomy discuss: https://t.co/Shahp6ukgO&mdash; Nasdaq (@Nasdaq) March 12, 2021         2.05pm GMT    Food and drink industry: exporters face serious problems    Here\u2019s Dominic Goudie, head of international trade at the Food and Drink Federation, on the reasons behind the slump in UK exports to the EU:  \u201cA sharp fall in our exports to the EU in January is hugely disappointing but comes as little surprise given the challenges our industry faces. The closure of hospitality across Europe already had significant impacts on our exports in 2020, and this has been compounded by the late notification of the trade agreement just a week before entry into force, with significant new barriers to trade impeding movements of goods. Many small businesses are struggling to move any goods into the EU because of the collapse of movements via groupage shipments.  \u201cBusinesses are facing wildly inconsistent demands and applications of rules at different EU ports that are blocking exports. Having taken a sensible and pragmatic step to ensure imports continue to flow, Government must now accept that exporters are facing serious problems that should be addressed as a priority. They need to work constructively with the EU to address barriers to trade by improving the implementation of the trade agreement and streamlining processes, otherwise EU exporters will face the same difficulties when the full UK border enters into force in 2022.\u201d        1.47pm GMT       Over in the US, the prices charged by producers rose last month - putting the spotlight back on inflation. The US producer prices index rose by 0.5% in February, and was up 2.8% over the last year, partly driven by rising gasoline prices.

PPI pic.twitter.com/Hv4tqiQZ6J&mdash; Stephanie Lewicky (@SLewicky_TDA) March 12, 2021    Rising producer prices could lead to a pick-up in headline inflation, but only if firms feel able to pass it onto consumers, rather than absorbing costs themselves.  That\u2019s a key issue for investors, as they ponder whether economic recovery and the US stimulus spending could create inflationary pressures, leading to higher borrowing costs. Here\u2019s some early reaction:    US PPI #inflation numbers are out: In line to somewhat higher than consensus expectations.Overall index is up 2.8% (Year-on-Year) and core 2.5%.The big question for #markets is, as #PPI comes under greater pressure, will this be passed on to the #CPI or will margins be reduced.&mdash; Mohamed A.

In a rare piece of positive news from a fashion retail sector battered by the coronavirus crisis, Burberry said on Friday that like-for-like store retail sales would be up by nearly a third year on year in the first three months of 2021. The unscheduled trading update cheered investors, with Burberry\u2019s share price up about 7% at lunchtime on Friday, its highest level since before the pandemic. The company said:   \u201cSince December, we have continued to see a strong rebound and now expect revenue and adjusted operating profit to be ahead of consensus expectations,\u201d   Burberry, known for its trench coats and distinctive patterned goods, said the performance upgrade is expected to lessen the overall decline in full-year revenues to 10%-11%. Analysts had forecast a fall of about 13%, according to Burberry. The company, which has used stars such as the footballer Marcus Rashford to broaden the appeal of its collections to a younger market, said in January it had also seen strong demand from Chinese and Korean shoppers in the closing months of 2020. While sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were down about 37%, said Burberry, on the back of store closures and fewer tourists, sales across the Asia Pacific market were up 11%. It again singled out China and South Korea as driving the recovery in sales.   Related: Burberry upgrades forecast as sales in China and South Korea rebound         1.11pm GMT       Kallum Pickering of Berenberg bank writes that the slump in UK-EU trade in January highlights the negative impact of rising costs and frictions to trade, now that the UK has left the EU Single Market.  The Brexit related drop in UK-EU trade is likely to be a combination of two factors: 1) initial administrative problems with the implementation of the new UK-EU border - which should ease over time;  2) a permanent supply shock to cross border trade which pushes costs higher and reduces consumer demand for final goods and producer demand for materials and semi-finished goods.   He predicts that UK-EU trade will probably rebound somewhat in February and March from the initial shock, so the first quarter of 2021 should be better than the January data may imply. But those costs and frictions mean it may remain below pre-Brexit levels for a long time to come. Political tensions could also hit trade, he adds:  That UK-EU relations seem to be souring badly adds to the uncertain outlook. Tensions are rising over the politically sensitive \u2018Irish protocol\u2019. The EU is currently threatening legal action after the UK unilaterally decided to extend the grace period on the checks it is legally bound to perform on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. This is a sensitive issue that could affect other elements of UK-EU relations and trade. If the EU perceives that the UK is shirking its legal commitments \u2013 pertaining to both the Brexit and future relationship agreements which London has ratified - then Brussels may react by levying retaliatory tariffs and, more importantly, taking an even harder line on the City of London\u2019s future access to the EU market.         12.39pm GMT    Analysis: Massive drop in UK trade shows extent of Boris Johnson's Brexit own goal    Here\u2019s my colleague Phillip Inman\u2019s analysis of today\u2019s trade data:  While most UK consumers found a way to weather the third lockdown, manufacturers were not so lucky after the government\u2019s last-minute deal with the EU plunged British ports into chaos and sent trade plummeting by 40%. Without a smooth route across the Channel, the manufacturing sector was always going to struggle. That trade dropped by the most in more than 20 years illustrates how dependent on trade the UK is and has always been. As an act of self-sabotage, Boris Johnson\u2019s willingness to negotiate the thinnest of Brexit deals was always going to rank alongside the major economic debacles of the past century. Up and down the country, businesses report edging towards the brink of collapse as hold-ups at the border prevent their goods making it to customers in the EU. Manufacturers, many of which are basically assembly points for components sourced from across the world, have struggled to keep production lines moving. The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output contracted by 2.3% month on month in January, with output falling in nine out of 13 subsectors. Worst affected was the car industry, which has already taken a battering over the past year and been denied almost any meaningful investment for four years while the mostly foreign-owned industry waited to see what life outside the EU would be like....

So says David Lowe, partner at law firm Gowling WLG, who adds:  The Cabinet Office points to data about truck movements claiming this shows Brexit has had no impact. But that is misleading - a lot of trucks are going out of the UK empty (having brought in imports). Truck movements is not relevant to what the actual exports are. The government needs to stop denying the obvious and instead focus on how EU exports can recover.

The UK, though, delayed them to give UK hauliers and businesses more time to adapt -- and yesterday pushed them back again, delaying SPS checks until January 2022. That should cut the risk of empty supermarket shelves. It also means EU food and animal exporters will avoid Brexit red tape for longer, when selling goods to the UK.....

They also flag up the slump in food exports due to fresh red tape at the border:  The largest decline in exports to the EU was in food products, which have been hit hard by manufacturers having new layers of bureaucracy imposed on them now the UK is no longer in the EU single market. These plunged 63.6 per cent in January. There was a 56.6 per cent decline in exports in the chemicals sector as manufacturers raced to export products ahead of the UK falling out of the EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Reach) regulations.

Photograph: House of Commons/PA    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, says the 2.9% drop in UK GDP in January shows the economic impact of Covid-19:  \u201cToday\u2019s figures highlight the impact the pandemic continued to have on our economy at the start of the year as we tackled the new variant of the virus- and I know this is a cause of concern for many. \u201cBut we also have reasons to be hopeful- we have set out a clear roadmap out of the pandemic, the NHS has vaccinated over 23 million people and my Budget last week set out our three part plan to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people. \u201cWe will continue to protect jobs and businesses as long as this crisis lasts, we will be honest with people and put the public finances on a more sustainable path, and we will begin the work of building our future economy.\u201d  But his Labour opposite number, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds, say that the Budget will undermine the recovery.  \u201cRather than securing the recovery, Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget last week risked weakening it through a combination of pay cuts and tax rises, and a looming cut to social security just as unemployment is set to spike.  \u201cThe Chancellor\u2019s mask has slipped. He\u2019s making irresponsible choices now and has no long-term plan for the future.

Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, calls the slump in UK exports to the EU \u2018staggering\u2019 - caused by problems at the border as well as stockpiling, and the pandemic.    The manufacturing sector, and in particular the automotive industry, suffered from initial border glitches, while the transport sector was also affected.   \u201cJanuary saw a staggering 40.7% fall in exports to the EU as the Brexit related disruption coincided with restrictions caused by new COVID variants. In comparison, trade with non-EU countries grew by 1.7% pointing to Brexit as the likely culprit, as intense stockpiling in December 2020 brought some trade flows ahead of the Brexit deadline.  \u201cLatest data points at stronger trade flows with the EU since February and we expect production to gradually recover. Although the longer term impact on supply chains will depend on how attractive the UK remains and the competition from other locations within the EU.   Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, says the trade figures will worry the City:  Some of this decline can be put down to lockdown, stockpiling and teething troubles. But it\u2019s clear that the Brexit transition has been far from smooth and markets will be paying close attention to whether current frictions mean long-term changes.\u201d   ING developed markets economist James Smith points out that some UK firms are still struggling to get to grips with Brexit:  Among other things, the fall will be linked to a) stockpiling in late 2020, allowing businesses to avoid the need to trade in early January, and b) some ripple effects from the Covid-related closure of the ports back in December.  Still, there can be little doubt that some of this damage is down to disruption. Some things have probably improved in the weeks since, given that, for example, major haulage firms have largely resumed deliveries between the UK and the continent (some had paused given the high percentage of wrongly filled-in paperwork). But there are also signs that firms are still struggling. Recent ONS business surveys show that there is still a small chunk of manufacturers who haven\u2019t been able to export recently, while many are reporting fewer shipments than usual. Unsurprisingly input prices have also been rising more than normal, though some of this will be down to international shipping issues. What\u2019s also telling is that a small - but clearly rising - number of firms in affected sectors are saying they are making changes to their supply chains.

A government spokesperson explains:   \u201cA unique combination of factors, including stockpiling last year, Covid lockdowns across Europe, and businesses adjusting to our new trading relationship, made it inevitable that exports to the EU would be lower this January than last. \u201cThis data does not reflect the overall EU \u2013 UK trading relationship post Brexit and, thanks to the hard work of hauliers and traders, overall freight volumes between the UK and the EU have been back to their normal levels since the start of February. \u201cMany businesses have adapted well, and our focus now is on making sure that any business that is still facing challenges gets the support they need to trade effectively with the EU.\u201d         8.31am GMT    Food and animal exports to EU slump 63%       Staff at Loch Fyne Seafarms, fishing for scallops, lobsters and lagoustines in Tarbert, Argyllshire, Scotland. Photograph: Jeremy Sutton-Hibbert/Alamy    Exports of food and live animals from UK farms and the fishing industry to the EU tumbled by 63% in January (or \u00a3700m). That\u2019s another clear sign of Brexit disruption, following many warnings from the seafood sector that red tape at the border is disrupting exports of their fresh goods to the EU.  The ONS says:  This is potentially because of stricter checks and certifications implemented by the EU at the end of the transition period. The Scottish Seafood Association says exports to the EU are being hit by \u201cred tape\u201d delays between Scotland and France. The consignment sign off is reportedly taking six times longer, and previously overnight transit of goods to France is reportedly now taking three days.

The slump in trade with the EU, excluding gold and other precious metals, is a reflection of disruption at UK borders. January saw the biggest monthly fall in imports and exports since Office for National Statistics records on trade began in 1997.

Related: Exports to EU plunge by \u00a35.6bn in first month since Brexit         8.04am GMT    UK trade with EU plunges after Brexit    Trade between the UK and the European Union has plunged in January, according to the latest data. According to the Office for National Statistics, UK exports of goods to the EU slumped by 40.7% in January, a truly precipitous decline Imports from the EU into the UK also tumbled, falling by 28.8% in the first month of the new trade relationship, driven by a drop in imports of cars and pharmaceuticals. As a result, UK goods imports and exports fell at the largest monthly rate since records began in 1997. The ONS reports that:  Exports of goods, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, fell by \u00a35.3 billion (19.3%) in January 2021, because of a \u00a35.6 billion (40.7%) fall in exports to the EU. Imports of goods, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, fell by \u00a38.9 billion (21.6%) in January 2021, driven by a \u00a36.6 billion (28.8%) fall in imports from the EU. Falling imports of goods, excluding non-monetary gold and other precious metals, were largely seen in machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals from the EU in January 2021, particularly in imports of cars and medicinal and pharmaceutical products.      UK trade with EU Photograph: ONS    The ONS says there are several potential contributing factors to this slump in trade - including Brexit disruption....  External evidence suggests some of the slower trade for goods in early January 2021 could be attributable to disruption caused by the end of the transition period.   .... the impact of stockpiling ahead of the Brexit deadline...  November and December 2020 saw increasing imports and exports of goods, particularly in machinery and transport equipment and chemicals. These increases were consistent with potential stockpiling of goods from the EU in preparation for the end of the EU exit transition period. UK goods imports from the EU also peaked in the weeks approaching previous Brexit deadlines in March and October 2019.   ...and also the current lockdown. One caveat: The way the UK collects export data has changed since Brexit (a ONS research note explains all here), so it could take longer to record some UK goods shipped to the EU. The ONS says this is \u2018unlikely\u2019 to change the trend in today\u2019s data, though:  Some of the EU export data will become available slightly more slowly under the new system. There will be small difference in January export estimates although this is unlikely to influence the trend of the movements in January.      In January, Brexit finally happened and UK imports and exports slumped (by value and by volume). Imports from the EU fell by 28%, exports fell by 40%.

After a record slump in 2020, we\u2019re about to discover how the UK economy fared at the start of 2021.  January was a tough month economically, with England entering its third national lockdown and tight restrictions in other parts of the country too. Businesses also had to get to grips with the UK-EU free trade deal, agreed just before Christmas.  Economists predict that the UK economy shrank by almost 5% during January, having returned to growth in December. A sharp decline, but not as severe as the 20% plunge suffered back in April. Most of the damage was probably suffered by services sector companies, with industry and construction managing to keep operating despite the lockdowns.  We also get new UK trade data, which is expected to show a decline in imports and exports in January following a burst of stockpiling late last year. Germany reported earlier this week that its trade with the UK plummeted in January, with imports from Britain more than halving.

So little has changed over the years | Catherine Mayer", "full_article": "Years ago, on an early morning furred with frost, something caught my attention as I passed the local churchyard: a mannequin sprawled on a gravestone. It took a moment for me to realise what I was seeing, a body, naked from the waist down. The police took a statement. This should have been the extent of my involvement. I couldn\u2019t identify the murder victim or add any other useful detail. Nevertheless, during the following week an officer dropped by my flat several times unannounced to \u201cupdate me on the case\u201d. On his last visit, he showed me a card he\u2019d made for a colleague as a joke, a post-mortem headshot of the victim with helmet and moustache added, transforming the dead woman, he said, into the spitting image of his boss. As horror robbed me of speech, he asked me out on a date. I thought about that encounter after the gut-punch news about Sarah Everard\u2019s disappearance, and that a suspect, Wayne Couzens, an officer of the Metropolitan police, was being held for questioning about her kidnap and killing. I thought about it when I read of the \u201creassurance patrols\u201d deployed in the area from which Everard was snatched, the visible presence of Couzens\u2019 colleagues supposed, somehow, to make women feel safer. Should the Met be investigating or investigated? This question gained urgency with reports that the force faces an inquiry into whether it properly looked into the claim that Couzens had exposed himself at a restaurant, days before Everard\u2019s disappearance. I thought about it when the Today programme responded to the outpouring of rage and sorrow for Everard by booking an interview with a criminologist called Prof Marian FitzGerald. Many women had taken to social media with their own stories of assault and intimidation. The broadcaster Shelagh Fogarty, for example, tweeted a list of bad things that had happened to her, starting with a man following her home from school when she was 10 and culminating four decades later with a stalker terrorising her for three years.   Related: Family of Sarah Everard pay tribute to 'bright and beautiful' woman    FitzGerald\u2019s response to similar testimonies, some of which were read at the beginning of the segment, was dismissive: \u201cPerhaps I\u2019m entitled to say as a woman we should not pander to stereotypes and get hysterical,\u201d she said. She advised \u201cthe sort of precautions I\u2019ve always taken walking about London late at night, knowing where to walk, where not to walk, how to hold yourself\u201d and rounded off her appearance with the observation that the risk to women \u201chasn\u2019t changed in a long time\u201d. This last point was true, but not in the way she meant it. The reason I cannot shake the memory of a police officer\u2019s unwanted attentions and grotesque misuse of a victim\u2019s image is precisely because so little has changed in the intervening years. Back then, in my 20s, I assumed progress just happened without us doing anything to prod it along. Equality shimmered on the near horizon. I understood violence purely as an interaction between individuals rather than grasping its systemic and cultural dimensions and the ways in which the institutions that should combat it too often harbour and enable it. Learning about these dimensions came at a personal cost that underscores my activism and helped propel Sandi Toksvig and me into creating the Women\u2019s Equality party in 2015. Yes, there are psychopaths, born not socially constructed, but even rotten apples take their cues from their surroundings, with studies suggesting that the behaviours of male psychopaths may differ from female psychopaths along gendered lines dictated by their upbringing and environment. Violence is rarely random, despite the frequency with which this phrase appears. Its targets are predetermined by hatreds that are learned, not inherent. The ordinary everyday sexism I knew in my youth, the routine sexualisation and dehumanisation of women, hasn\u2019t gone away, any more than have the other ideologies that start from the idea that some humans are worth less than others. On the contrary, these things have found amplifying channels and platforms online and are enjoying a terrible resurgence. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently evaluating charges against two Met police officers accused of taking selfies in front of the bodies of murdered sisters Nicole Smallman and Bibaa Henry, then sharing those images on WhatsApp. These days women still walk home with keys threaded through anxious knuckles, only to switch on their computers to find death and rape threats. We are supposed to shrug these things off, treat them as normal, rather than normalised. Well I\u2019m not prepared to do so. Plans for distanced vigils and protests and the continuing tidal wave of personal testimonies suggest that many, many others feel as I do. This is in the face of opposition from the Metropolitan police, which is banning the Reclaim These Streets vigil planned on Clapham Common on Saturday night despite the organisers\u2019 care to ensure adherence to Covid safety. I joined more than 200 women, MPs, party colleagues, charity workers and others to sign a letter pushing for action to tackle violence against women and girls. And such action is long overdue. Women are leading the calls, but it is way past time that men stepped up to the plate. We can best honour the victims of violence not only by demanding their assailants face justice, but by challenging the systems and cultures that enable violence and pin the blame on victims. I\u2019m looking at Westminster with its failure to tackle its own culture of abusive behaviour \u2013 its own 2018 investigation found that one in five people working there had suffered harassment. I\u2019m looking at the media, reflexively denying its own culpability while pumping out stories that diminish, divide and dehumanise. And I\u2019m looking at those tasked with protecting us. I\u2019m remembering a winter morning and all these years later, I still feel the cold.

Is it too soon to have a child?", "full_article": "Since I started dating my girlfriend six months ago, I\u2019ve had this feeling that something just fits, in a way I\u2019ve never felt before. In past relationships I\u2019ve had periods of insecurity and mismatches in energy or expectations. Here, so far, there has been none of that. The few misunderstandings we\u2019ve had have been worked out in a way that left us feeling better than before. There\u2019s a lot of warmth and affection; we trust and respect each other, and the sex is very good. I don\u2019t feel like anything is missing. Sometimes, I suppose a bit more passion or excitement could be nice, but I attribute some of this to the stress of pandemic times. Given our healthy sex life, I\u2019m not hung up on it. Here\u2019s the issue: I\u2019ve always imagined dating someone for at least two years before considering next steps (marriage, children). Both of us are on the same page about wanting these things one day. When I first met my girlfriend, she had come to terms with the possibility of not having children biologically, as she is nearing 40. I should mention that I am 30, also a woman, and would like to have children biologically if I can, though presumably I have more time. However, as we have become closer, she has made a few comments suggesting she would like the experience of having a child biologically, if possible. I am sure she would never pressure me about it. Of course, I can\u2019t make this decision entirely on my own, but my question is: if the gut feeling is good, if the relationship feels right, is it worth jumping in? Should we take the steps to have a child together this early on in our relationship? Or at least, propose the option? It seems you have a really good feeling about this relationship, but it\u2019s great you are being so thoughtful, because this is about having children and that deserves contemplation. I consulted relationship psychotherapist Jo Coker (cosrt.org). She thought your relationship sounded \u201creally refreshing, really attuned\u201d and there were lots of good signs, not least being able to work on things together, and finding a positive solution for both of you when things have gone wrong. But we both wondered where the idea of waiting for two years comes from, and whether you could challenge this? \u201cIs it,\u201d asked Coker, \u201csomething you\u2019ve seen in peer groups, or in your parental history? What have you seen magically happen after two years?\u201d \u201cSometimes, when we are younger,\u201d explains Coker, \u201cit can take longer to reach the established stage.\u201d As we grow older, and know ourselves better, we can often reach this stage sooner. \u201cA relationship,\u201d says Coker, who has sat in with many couples over her 20 years as a therapist, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to be long term to be good\u2026 relationships tend to be as good as the day they\u2019re on.\u201d Perhaps your girlfriend had shelved the idea of motherhood until you came along, and something about the solidity and promise of your relationship has allowed her to look at the prospect anew. You also say you\u2019d like a child, so these are all things you need to talk about. \u201cYour relationship,\u201d says Coker, \u201cis functioning well and is solid in terms of your communication skills. The bit that needs consideration is whether you agree about how the pregnancy would happen. Who has the baby, and what impact would it have on your relationship at this stage?\u201d   Related: My relationship is not quite perfect: if we get married, is it doomed?    To my mind, this is where your energies need to go next: the logistics and practicalities of having a baby. It\u2019s often only when we talk about how we feel and what we want, and see other\u2019s reactions, that we acknowledge those feelings ourselves. And of course, it\u2019s the only way to find out whether you\u2019re on the same page in terms of outcome and timing. You both seem able to talk very well, which is a very big plus point. Can you talk to others who have gone through a similar journey? Which bits did they find challenging? What many new parents find tricky is working out not only how physical tasks are shared, but also who carries the emotional load. You talk about jumping in, which sounds reckless, but you don\u2019t seem reckless. Jumping in with a bit of thought and knowledge sounds sensible.

A tiny germ of controversy or rebellion can spread across parliament, through Whitehall and into the prime minister\u2019s office within hours. The windowless offices are cramped, MPs sit elbow to elbow in a Commons chamber that can only squeeze just over 400 MPs into its seats, two-thirds of the number in parliament. \nIt is also a place of macho presenteeism, where the Greggs in Westminster tube station often serves as a nightly dinner spot for some of the most senior office-holders in the land. \nThis was the situation when Covid-19 arrived in the UK. The Guardian has spoken to a number of people who were there at the time. They revealed that the virus spread far more widely than has been reported, and spoke about the sense of panic across Whitehall as Covid threatened to paralyse government. \n \n  \n  \n  A member of staff sticks a poster of a rainbow on a window at 10 Downing Street last April, while Boris Johnson was in hospital with coronavirus. \n  Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP via Getty Images \n  \n \nHorrified staff and ministers, dealing with the worst crisis in decades, had to reckon with how the country could be run when everyone in charge was getting ill. \nFamously, Boris Johnson, Matt Hancock and Dominic Cummings contracted the virus. So did England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, and the then cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Ministers and their staff had it. Almost all the staff in Downing Street, too. \nIt spread to special advisers across Whitehall and to parliamentary lobby journalists. Although the Palace of Westminster escaped any mass outbreaks among staff, several MPs caught Covid. Many in the office of the Labour leader, including Seumas Milne, had it. Jeremy Corbyn may have had it, although he was never tested and so has never been sure. \n \n  Related: How Covid spread through Westminster's corridors of power \u2013 timeline  \n \nBut the situation was at its worst at the heart of Downing Street. For a number of days aides looked almost entirely to the then director of communications, Lee Cain, for direction. \n\u201cNo 10 was a plague pit,\u201d one adviser recalls. \u201cNo one outside the postcode quite knows how bad it got in there.\u201d \nAnother said: \u201cLee was running the country, genuinely, for quite some time.\u201d \nAccording to many of those present, almost the entire staff team in Downing Street caught Covid-19 at some point during those weeks, with James Slack, the prime minister\u2019s spokesperson, a notable exception. \n\u201cYou\u2019d got to a meeting expecting to see someone important and they were gone \u2013 and you knew why,\u201d another adviser said. \u201cIt started off more surreal than scary, but it became very scary once the PM was so ill.\u201d \nThere are fewer workplaces less suited to social distancing than Westminster. High security means much business is conducted in person. MPs vote in packed and sweaty corridors. Staffers share desks. Most windows can only be heaved open a crack with brute force. \nDowning Street is far from opulent when compared with the palaces of most heads of government. Staff use small entrances and corridors with flaking paint and decorated only with laminated health and safety notices. In the weeks leading up to lockdown, staff acknowledge there was no social distancing to speak of, only jokes about how to most respectfully sing God Save the Queen while hand-washing. \nStaffers working in political and civil service roles during that time, who spoke on condition of anonymity as some are still in post, admit the pandemic took time to appear on the radar of a government preoccupied with a great election victory, Brexit and, closer to home, a purge of special advisers under Cummings\u2019 iron fist. \nThere were concerns, but there was also a lightheartedness. One aide held a birthday party for fellow Tories and served Corona beer. Johnson was sufficiently unconcerned to miss five Cobra meetings in January and February. It seems clear the UK was deeply unprepared for the pandemic \u2013 from out-of-date PPE to delayed preparedness training \u2013 while contingency planning was diverted to a no-deal Brexit. \nLindsay Hoyle, the newly elected Speaker of the House of Commons, said the whole of government did not see until quite late the extent to which Covid-19 would radically alter everyone\u2019s lives. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think we got a picture [for a while] for how big of scale this was, or how it was going to affect the house. Like everybody else, we were underestimating how bad it was going to be. I\u2019ll be very open, very honest about that. It was lack of understanding of what we were facing.\u201d \nOne of the few people still working in a high-profile job in Westminster who had experience of tackling a pandemic was the shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth. \n\u201cI was actually in Downing Street for swine flu 10 years ago,\u201d the Labour MP said. \u201cI remember when I first heard of the virus in Wuhan I thought: I wonder if that\u2019s going to be like swine flu. But I obviously didn\u2019t appreciate at that point it would be off the scale.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n  Johnson hosts a panel event and reception to mark International Women\u2019s Day on 5 March 2020, an event that Nadine Dorries also attended. \n  Photograph: Reuters \n  \n \nAshworth asked for his first briefing with Whitty in January 2020. By February he was doing \u201cnothing else\u201d but studying the trajectory of the virus, he said. But it was when the health minister Nadine Dorries was confirmed to have Covid on 10 March that the magnitude of the crisis fully dawned on some of those in government.  \n\u201cThe moment we realised this is probably more widespread in the country than we thought is when Nadine Dorries tested positive,\u201d one health official said. \nAt the time, people were only meant to get tested if they had been to one of the affected areas. \u201cSo the original assumption was, she hasn\u2019t been to Italy or China so she hasn\u2019t got Covid, even if she\u2019s got some symptoms. And then she tested positive and I remember thinking: hang on, is this thing spreading much more widely than the people realise?\u201d \nOn 11 March, the day after Dorries tested positive, Liverpool played Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in front of a crowd of tens of thousands at Anfield. It was also the day of Rishi Sunak\u2019s first budget.  \n \n  \n  \n  Pats on the back for the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, after delivering his budget in the House of Commons on 11 March. \n  Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA \n  \n \n\u201cFootage in the House of Commons for Rishi Sunak\u2019s budget showed Tories slapping him on the back. It was a terrible look,\u201d said Ashworth, who started advising staff to stay at home the week before lockdown. \u201c[The government] should not have been doing that. I think there was definitely a feeling of British exceptionalism in Downing Street.\u201d \nMany of those at the heart of the story who caught the virus admit they were slow to realise how fast it was spreading. One special adviser recalled starting to experience symptoms in the middle of a meeting with a national newspaper\u2019s political editor. \n \n  \n  \n  Lee Cain, second right, and Dominic Cummings, right, at a news conference inside 10 Downing Street on 12 March 2020. \n  Photograph: Simon Dawson/PA \n  \n \n\u201cEveryone was getting ill, it was quite striking how obvious it was,\u201d one senior Labour official said. \n\u201cIt felt like a cold,\u201d said another senior party official. \u201cAnd you wouldn\u2019t normally go home because you had a slight cough. But then I was eating something and it tasted like metal. And the inside of my nose felt weird. And that\u2019s when I realised.\u201d \nOne political journalist who started feeling ill described being gripped by horror later in the afternoon when they remembered that the MP they had met earlier for coffee had breezily announced she was off to a meeting with her entire parliamentary party \u2013 and wondered how many they might have unwittingly infected. \n\u201cIt was so different because it directly affected everyone, I got so many calls from journalists or MPs asking for personal advice, what happens if I\u2019ve had dinner here or I\u2019ve met this person, or if I\u2019ve been to see my 80-year-old mother,\u201d one health official said. \n \n  \n  \n  Chris Whitty, Boris Johnson and Sir Patrick Vallance give a press conference on the pandemic on 16 March 2020. \n  Photograph: Richard Pohle/EPA \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  Dominic Cummings listens to Johnson during the news conference on 16 March. \n  Photograph: Reuters \n  \n \nOn 16 March, Johnson convened a meeting with Corbyn, Ashworth and staffers including Cummings and Milne, as well as Whitty, in Downing Street. It was intended to shore up Labour support for the coronavirus bill, introduced three days later. \u201cEveryone was crowded around one desk,\u201d one observer said. \u201cIt was insane if you think about it.\u201d \nThe Labour group argued forcefully for more economic intervention, given the spontaneous lockdown many people in the country were already beginning to observe. Two sources in the room said Johnson agreed with Corbyn and Ashworth that some form of full national lockdown would be inevitable. The meeting was cordial; Milne and Johnson even shared a joke about their time as journalists. \nThe meeting\u2019s significance might have been passed over had it not been for what followed.  \nMilne told friends he came down with a temperature that night \u2013 and was subsequently featured on the front page of the Mail on Sunday as the man who might have given the virus to the prime minister. Sources close to Corbyn said the then Labour leader also had some cold-like symptoms. Ashworth, who was also in the room, did not catch it. \nNo one can say for sure who spread Covid to whom, because the virus was already rampant in Westminster. \nThat evening Johnson advised people to avoid all unnecessary contact and travel and to stay away from pubs and theatres \n \n  \n  \n  Matt Hancock watches Boris Johnson speaking during prime minister\u2019s questions on 25 March. \n  Photograph: House of Commons/PA \n  \n \nOn Wednesday 18 March, PMQs was quieter than usual but MPs still dribbled into the chamber. Sunak and Hancock, the health secretary, sat close to Johnson on the frontbench. Corbyn, despite being over 70, attended in person, with his spokesperson saying the government advice on shielding was still not clear. \nOn the Friday evening, Johnson said pubs and restaurants should close and Sunak announced a furlough scheme. On Monday 23 March, in a ministerial broadcast from Downing Street, Johnson ordered the entire nation to stay at home. \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe first indication that officials outside Downing Street had that something was wrong with Johnson was a quiet inquiry by a No 10 special adviser to speak with Whitty on Wednesday. The chief medical officer advised the prime minister to get a test, which came back positive. \nHancock began experiencing symptoms on 26 March, and rang his staff to say he had a temperature and was getting tested, prompting panic in the department about how to handle the media frenzy they anticipated should they have to announce the health secretary was ill with coronavirus. But within hours the prime minister tested positive, and that was the story. \n \n  \n  \n  Matt Hancock making the announcement that he has tested positive for coronavirus via Twitter. \n  Photograph: @MattHancock/PA \n  \n \nJohnson\u2019s office realised in horror that one key person he might have infected was Hoyle, who has type 1 diabetes. \n\u201cI got a phone call immediately. They were very worried about me, because the footage on the television was Boris six inches away speaking to me. And Hancock had also done the same in the same week,\u201d Hoyle said. \u201cI was very lucky, I didn\u2019t get infected, but nobody could have got closer to either of them. I don\u2019t believe it was caught in the house. Far from it. My worry was about them bringing it into the house.\u201d \nMany of those staffers who fell ill like dominoes over the coming days tried to keep working. Hancock was isolating when he got a positive test but carried on issuing directions from home. \u201cIf anything he was almost more manic,\u201d one official said. \nAnother senior party insider said they and many others just worked through the virus, taking short naps in between calls. \u201cEven though I was ill, I\u2019d worked every day from home for a week and I just used to get very tired in the afternoon and go to bed for two hours. And then I kept on working.\u201d \n\u201cSo much was happening by video and you could not always tell if people were at home because they were ill,\u201d one aide said, describing it as \u201clike playing wink murder\u201d to spot who was trying to struggle through, or who was missing. \nWhitty was forced into self-isolation by Johnson\u2019s diagnosis, as were many other staffers. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s all-seeing chief of staff, departed London for Durham with his young family, his wife already sick and knowing he was likely to develop the illness. \nIn the week after Johnson was diagnosed, it was not taken too seriously by staff, or the prime minister himself. He worked in isolation in Downing Street and would thump himself on the chest and say \u201cstrong as a bull!\u201d and aides would laugh. \nBut it was quietly becoming evident it was taking him a long time to shake off the virus. \n \n  \n  \n  Boris Johnson chairing a remote session with his cabinet while self-isolating on 31 March 2020. \n  Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP/Getty Images \n  \n \nAfter making his daily joke, he would cough. Then cough for longer. Johnson was working in a small office connected by a stairwell to his No 11 flat next to another used by his private secretary and senior aides, who would toss paperwork and media scripts through the open door.  \nJohnson chaired cabinet on 28 March by video link, \u201ccoughing and spluttering his way through conference calls\u201d, according to sources, which leaked into newspapers. Public questions were starting to be asked about the prime minister\u2019s condition. \nOn Friday 3 April it was clear that Johnson\u2019s symptoms were lingering and aides took a video in which an unkempt and clearly struggling prime minister said he \u201cstill has one of the symptoms, a minor symptom, I still have a temperature\u201d. \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe video was recorded on Johnson\u2019s phone and took multiple different takes to record because he was coughing so much. Aides had to keep politely finding different ways to say: \u201cI\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve quite nailed that there, boss.\u201d \nEven then, Johnson was joking about trying to look well on camera and \u201cuplift the nation\u201d. Many felt at the time \u2013 and more now do in hindsight \u2013 that more should have been done that week to persuade him to rest. \nAdvisers were getting worried. Discreet preparations were being made that week for Johnson\u2019s admission to St Thomas\u2019 hospital, should it be necessary. The Guardian got wind of this but it was denied by officials. \nBy Sunday, it was necessary. Johnson phoned his senior staff before he left for hospital confirming Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, should take charge in his absence. Cummings was also out of the picture, ill in Durham. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t actually scary \u2013 personally scary \u2013 until the PM almost died,\u201d one senior official said. \u201cFrom that moment you go from it being just a manic effort to get everything done to the consequences of it all hitting you so hard.\u201d \nThere was still a persistent attempt, outwardly, to pretend Johnson remained in charge. At the daily press briefing on Monday 6 April, Raab kept repeating that the prime minister was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d. In fact, neither was true. \nThat night Johnson was moved to ICU. He had told the nation he hoped to turn the tide in 12 weeks and that restrictions would be reviewed in three weeks. In that third week, he was in intensive care. \n \n  \n  \n  Police officers outside St Thomas\u2019 hospital after Boris Johnson was moved to intensive care. \n  Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  Dominic Raab during a media briefing in Downing Street on 6 April 2020. \n  Photograph: Pippa Fowles/Crown Copyright/10 Downing Street/PA \n  \n \nThe symbolism was not lost on many working closely with him. Johnson\u2019s private secretary, Martin Reynolds, phoned Downing Street and said there was a \u201c50/50\u201d chance the prime minister would be put on a ventilator.

Sedwill was in charge of drawing up a plan for succession if Johnson died \u2013 approved by the prime minister himself. \nNo 10 at that point was like \u201ca ghost ship\u201d, as one aide put it. Cummings was in Durham, Cain was on his last day of self-isolation. \n\u201cLee came in like a bullet the next day,\u201d one colleague recalls. \u201cThere was a meeting he turned up to with Raab, Sedwill and other civil servants and he was like: \u2018Hello, I\u2019m back, I\u2019m in charge of the politics now.\u2019\u201d \nThe political staff in No 10, particularly those with a background in Conservative internecine politics, were also starting to think about the nightmare scenario of the death of the prime minister. \u201cYou knew the party would have forced some awful leadership election, it would have been carnage,\u201d one said. \u201cIt was about confronting the utter horror of that \u2013 in a pandemic \u2013 and feeling pretty overwhelmed with emotion, too.\u201d \nRepresenting one of the flaws of the British political system, Downing Street resembles the court of a medieval king. What matters is the prime minister, and who matters are those who have the ear of the prime minister. Advisers fall in and out of favour and only a few are known to be directly speaking for the prime minister \u2013 those who can therefore be taken seriously. When the prime minister is suddenly absent, the system no longer works. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a gap, like physically, in the building, and there was a bit of a gap politically,\u201d one former adviser said. \n\u201cThe two main characters \u2013 Johnson and Cummings \u2013 were absent,\u201d one No 10 insider said. \n\u201cWhen the court doesn\u2019t have a king, it\u2019s just a massive vacuum,\u201d another former staffer said. \u201cThe only reason senior people had authority is because they spoke with his voice. So when you remove him, it becomes very, very difficult to keep that authority.\u201d \n\u201cBoris in particular, his presence is really felt, he takes up space,\u201d another ex-staffer said. \u201cAnd the other person who had that presence was Dom. And he was gone as well.\u201d \n\u201cThat week was hell,\u201d another official said. \u201cThere were all these meetings where it was never completely clear who was driving things or in charge. Who was actually going to be there if you had a meeting?\u201d \nThose who recovered were desperate to get back into work. \u201cI remember saying I have to be there, I\u2019m going mad at home,\u201d a Whitehall source said. At the time, civil servants were ordered to work from home but many in No 10 wanted to be in the building. Cain told them they could come in if they wanted and he would take the flak. \n\u201cLee did end up running the country for about two weeks, I\u2019d say,\u201d one adviser said. \u201cThere was no one else any sort of senior level who had any sort of authority on behalf of the PM to be doing stuff or making decisions.\u201d \nMinisters\u2019 aides were buddied up and told to get to grips with a different department so they could shadow each other if another fell sick. \nCain had been at the prime minister\u2019s side for years, through his time at Vote Leave, to the Foreign Office, to his time on the backbenches and through his leadership campaign. Even more than Cummings, Cain was seen by people in Whitehall as speaking with his boss\u2019s voice. \u201cIt was a bit like a very long marriage,\u201d one close friend said. \n \n  \n  \n  Dominic Raab, centre, arrives at 10 Downing Street on 7 April. \n  Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA \n  \n \nRaab, the \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d, as he was nicknamed, took charge of the day-to-day business as part of a quad of ministers with Sunak, Hancock and Michael Gove. Hancock was often the target in those meetings as the government struggled with PPE shortages, deep concerns over ventilator capacity and what many felt were wildly optimistic promises by the health secretary on testing. \nRaab felt his role was to be a stabilising force, one aide said. \u201cHe was a good manager, he didn\u2019t push his own agenda. It was just a holding position. But he didn\u2019t step up in the way Rishi stepped up. You\u2019d hardly say it was a moment for Dom Raab.\u201d \nOthers described Raab\u2019s understated attitude to the role as a strength. \u201cHe had a lot of big jostling egos to manage in the cabinet and he managed it,\u201d an aide said. \nA senior Downing Street source said it was like \u201cchalk and cheese\u201d working with Raab versus working with Johnson. The prime minister would hand out jobs from his red box, happy to delegate \u2013 \u201ca bit more loosey-goosey\u201d as one insider put it. Raab was extremely strict with protocol and insisted everything went through Cain. \n \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nIn the prime minister\u2019s absence, battle lines were also starting to be drawn between those who believed opening the economy was imperative and those who believed a long lockdown was necessary. \nCummings spent much of his isolation reading about the Spanish flu pandemic and told advisers after he returned that he had been convinced of the need for tougher measures and slower reopenings. There was some political calculation at play as well: Cain and the Tory adviser Isaac Levido believed the party would be annihilated at the next election if there was a catastrophic death toll, whereas voters would be more forgiving of economic turmoil. \nAmong those in favour of \u201crunning in hot\u201d, which one characterised as \u201ctrying to allow desperate business owners to salvage their livelihoods\u201d, were Sunak and the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, Edward Lister, who was shielding at home for much of the period. Newspapers were constantly briefed about the rows between \u201cdoves and hawks\u201d. \nGove was someone who \u201cjumped from one camp to the other\u201d, one adviser said, though in latter months he has been a more predictable voice of caution, alongside Hancock. In those early weeks, it was drily observed in Whitehall that Gove always seemed to be characterised as a hawk, whatever his position. \n \n  \n  \n  Media wait outside 10 Downing Street on 9 April 2020. \n  Photograph: Peter Summers/Getty Images \n  \n \nNo 10 and Whitehall were beset by leaks during that period, on the very biggest issues. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking Zoom,\u201d a special adviser said. \u201cYou\u2019d log on to a sensitive meeting and you think it\u2019s going to be five key people and then you\u2019re like, hang on, why are there 80 people here and who the hell are they? We may as well broadcast this thing live to the world.\u201d \nThe daily 9.15am call between Raab, Sunak, Gove and Hancock would constantly leak. \u201cRish just got to the point where he wouldn\u2019t even say anything in the meeting,\u201d one insider said. \nWith Johnson temporarily out of the picture, political aides suggested there were some attempts by ministers or civil servants to quietly discard unpopular issues. An adviser recalls a suggestion that a legal signoff connected with HS2 was needed \u2013 and that it be delayed until the prime minister\u2019s return. \u201cOne of the first things the PM said when he got back was: \u2018I can\u2019t believe they tried to delay HS2 while I was in the ICU.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cPeople really pushed their luck during that time \u2013 cabinet ministers, civil servants,\u201d a senior aide said. \u201cPeople delivered statements for approval by No 10 just 10 minutes before they were supposed to deliver them at the press conference and we had to be like: hang the fuck on!\u201d \nAll the actions of staff during that period are likely to be the subject of a public inquiry \u2013 perhaps the most important undertaking in living memory. Many believe the mistakes that were made were not a direct result of the way the virus ripped through the heart of Westminster and hobbled the operations of the government, but predictable consequences of a decade of deliberate policy. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t in government. So I don\u2019t know the extent that people being off ill hindered the decision-making on a day-to-day basis,\u201d Ashworth said. \u201cBut the reason our response has been so disappointing and why we\u2019ve been so exposed is because of decisions made over many years. The absolute scandal about the way in which we allowed the virus to rip through social care, not giving their staff sick pay, which meant that staff had to go to work. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve built an economy which is characterised by zero-hours contracts, temporary work. These are all a reflection of the type of economy that the Tories have built over the last 10 years.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n  Boris Johnson records an Easter Sunday video message at No 10 after his release from hospital. \n  Photograph: Getty Images \n  \n \nJohnson returned to Downing Street on 12 April to a team that felt \u201coverwhelmed with relief\u201d, according to one staffer.

They said: \u201cIt\u2019s been used by lecturers and, historically, has been ignored when students have raised it, and now you have just used it in a public meeting with students. \u201cLike many students have been saying, I find it unacceptable myself that you have used that word in a meeting. Absolutely unacceptable.\u201d Another student added: \u201cI\u2019m sorry but you are not a black man, you can\u2019t use that word.\u201d In response, Habib, who is originally from South Africa and has been the director of the university since the new year, defended his use of the word by saying: \u201cYou do [find it unacceptable], I don\u2019t actually. I come from a part of the world where we actually do use the word.\u201d Habib then said, in response to a black student saying he shouldn\u2019t use the word: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I offended you. I come from a part of the world when somebody uses it, the context matters. What I was trying to simply say is that if you find it offensive I\u2019m sorry.\u201d After the meeting, discussions among parts of the student community raised the issue of Habib potentially resigning after his comments.

Well, because context matters and I was arguing for taking punitive action. You cannot impute maligned intention without understanding context. Do I believe that only blacks can verbalise the word. No, I don\u2019t. \u201cI am aware that this is a common view among activists committed to an identitarian politics. I don\u2019t identify with this political tradition. I grew up in a political tradition that is more cosmopolitan oriented and more focused on the class dimensions of structural problems.\u201d Hisham Pryce-Parchment, the student union\u2019s anti-racism officer who was present at the meeting, said many students posted on social media afterwards saying Habib should resign, and that an apology would not be enough. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t actually grasp, and seems incapable of grasping the violence of the words, particularly for black students,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole thing was shocking from start to finish.\u201d He added: \u201cI know that many black students quit the call and didn\u2019t wait for the end of it when he said that.

So obviously him answering that question in that way and saying that word is absolutely shocking.\u201d Habib told the Guardian: \u201cA student did indeed pose a question that Soas was not responsive to anti-black racism and suggested that a staff member who used the word is still on the payroll. I did indeed use the word and said the following: \u2018If someone used the word against another staff member, then it would violate our policy and the case should be brought to my attention.\u2019 I also said that this is the first that I had heard of the incident. \u201cI then did apologise saying that no offence was intended, and I again said that if the word was used by a staff against another human being, then it would be a disciplinary offence as it would violate our policies. \u201cI am not sure why I should resign.

Wayne Pivac (centre) has made Wales a more nuanced side since taking over from Warren Gatland. Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Shutterstock    What they have retained is the conditioning that enables them to play hard to the end, exemplified by their captain, Alun Wyn Jones, who continues to defy time and the battering his body has taken over 15 years of international rugby. It looked in the autumn as if Wales needed even more than their leader as they slumped to defeats against Scotland, Ireland and England and some of their experienced hardcore looked as if they had reached the Dad\u2019s Army phase of their careers. Pivac needed results this year with a break clause in his contract at the end of it, and rather than invest in the future he coaxed more out of the likes of George North and Jonathan Davies by playing them out of position: the former at 13 and the latter at inside-centre. \u201cIt brings a bit of life back into boys who have been there a long time,\u201d said the head coach, who looked as if he was not so much running out of road but had taken the wrong one when results meant he moved on his defence coach Byron Hayward last November.     The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.   Just as Wales were not as poor as their position suggested then, neither are they now the best around. They have captured the moment and, praise be, they are focusing on this Six Nations rather than a World Cup which is more than two years away. The oldest squad in the tournament may need an overhaul, but not in a rush if Pivac can coax more out of players who thought they had experienced it all. And they have Louis Rees-Zammit on the wing, a latterday JJ Williams who did not sleep for two days after the victory over England in the last round having been denied a try by the bounce of the ball.

Not since Vladimir Putin shared those topless holiday pics, perfecting the butterfly stroke and breaking actual twigs with the simple power of his legs, have there been such strangely intimate insights into those who rule over us. There are rules to the vaxxie: you must have Viking-level chest hair, you must let your shirt hang like Morrissey in his first appearance on Top of The Pops, and you must cut a straight to camera look that suggests Dr Ross-era George Clooney. The twinkle in your eyes should make clear that you are absolutely not going to wince when that needle comes near you.     Johnny Mercer gets his Covid vaccine. \u2018The look in the nurse\u2019s eyes can only be read as utter glee.\u2019 Photograph: Twitter    In January, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the prime minister of Greece, showed us how to do it with the gritted determination of Kirk Douglas in Spartacus. Masked up and wearing a silver pendant that he surely picked up in Camden Market in 1993, Mitsotakis had a casually opened baby-blue work shirt which revealed an unapologetic garden of chest hair \u2013 and upper body that has clearly seen the HITT benefits of whoever the Greek Joe Wicks is. Vaccinations as domain of the Alpha heart-throb was not a pivot we could have imagined, even in the depths of our own corona\u2019d-out fug. But it wasn\u2019t just Mitsotakis, other politicians have been blue-steeling it too. The Conservative MP Johnny Mercer, who looks like a video of Giles Coren being played backwards, had a vaxxie that was as slick as Mitsotakis\u2019s (although the look in the nurse\u2019s eyes can only be read as utter glee at administering something sharp into the arm of someone who tweets things like: \u201cWe tried with the shirt on but I simply couldn\u2019t get the sleeves over my muscles\u201d). While Dr Dan Poulter, another Tory MP, revealed a hairy torso and sported a pose that could double as an 8x10 headshot for the reboot of ITV\u2019s Gladiators. We\u2019ve had variations too: Zdravko Mari\u0107, the minister of finance in Croatia, had his in a ridiculously tight white T-shirt, which was a not-so-humble body brag, while Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, coyly pulled his white shirt over his left breast while he was having his, like some office Christmas party version of Botticelli\u2019s The Birth of Venus.     \u2018Olivier V\u00e9ran coyly pulled his white shirt over his left breast, like some office Christmas party version of Botticelli\u2019s The Birth of Venus.\u2019 Photograph: Jeanne Accorsini/DICOM/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock    By baring their naked humanity, the politicians behind these vaxxies have reminded us that we\u2019re all in it together. Not really, though. Mitsotakis got into trouble for breaking Covid restrictions and V\u00e9ran\u2019s house was searched  by the French police following legal complaints about the government\u2019s handling of the pandemic. And thanks to Poulter and Mercer\u2019s government, the NHS workers who jabbed them will be receiving a mere 1% pay rise as a thank you. So what has the vaxxie taught us about the modern man?

You\u2019re not supposed to have snot, and yet I had much snot.\u201d \u201cNo, but I had a pain in my eyebrow.\u201d \u201cWas it on the eyebrow or behind the eyebrow?\u201d Last time I overshared my health status, I had tested positive but Mr Z hadn\u2019t, and shortly afterwards, he did too.

Obviously Meghan is right). No one day was worse than a bad hangover, but you would never get a hangover for 10 days straight, so in aggregate it was worse. On the plus side, it wasn\u2019t self-inflicted. I\u2019m more or less certain Mr Z brought the virus home from the shop, and he was definitely getting something necessary, not a snacking chorizo and some banana milk. My friend T mulled this over. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had any disease that\u2019s worse than a bad hangover.\u201d I ruminated on this for ages. What is worse than the worst hangover? Maybe childbirth? It\u2019s not a symptom, as such, but it is impossible to overstate how annoying my family was.

I couldn\u2019t reply \u201cIt is no big deal,\u201d since it was still \u201cduring\u201d. I couldn\u2019t reply \u201cIt is a big deal,\u201d because it wasn\u2019t. It reminded me of the time he beat me at hangman with the word \u201ctwo\u201d. I was so sure that he just didn\u2019t realise \u201ctoo\u201d had two Os that I couldn\u2019t see past it. He was four, and I was 14. My mother, whom I had seen while I was probably infectious, became convinced that she also had Covid but was blissfully asymptomatic, which struck me as pretty unlikely, considering she just has to see someone with a cold from across a motorway to end up in hospital with pneumonia. I ordered her a test anyway. I explained in quite close detail how you had to register it before you took it, and in the peculiar way of families that you can hear what they\u2019re thinking down a phone line, she thought: \u201cBlah blah, how much more of this customer service nonsense do I have to listen to?\u201d Duly, she didn\u2019t register it properly and waited 10 more days for her negative result. \u201cCumbersome system,\u201d she complained, and I agreed that yes, having to attach your name and address to a barcode before anyone could contact you was indeed a ludicrous thing, and I blamed Tory cronyism.

It was mad. I could just about exist if I was always walking, but as soon as I sat down, it could take me anything up to 37 minutes to get up again. I walked so much I broke my Fitbit.

Gressoney-Saint-Jean, which lies at the bottom of Monte Rosa, was the first location in Italy for the filming of Ridley Scott\u2019s House of Gucci, based on the true story of the killing of the former chief of the fashion house, Maurizio Gucci, by his ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani. As with all ski resorts in Italy, Gressoney-Saint-Jean, home to about 800 people, was forced to cut off its seasonal lifeline because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThe loss of the ski season has caused huge economic damage,\u201d Mattia Alliod, the mayor of Gressoney-Saint-Jean, said. \u201cFor months we have been closed and have had no visitors, apart from those who have been able to come to their second homes over the last few weeks. So as you can imagine, the arrival of the film crew was like a breath of fresh air.\u201d   Graphic     A behind-the-scenes photo of Lady Gaga, who plays Reggiani in the film, and Adam Driver, who portrays Maurizio Gucci, taken on the balcony of what appears to be a ski lodge overlooking the Alps, garnered much excitement when it was shared on Lady Gaga\u2019s Instagram account.

Photograph: Mairo Cinquetti/NurPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock    The crew has now moved on to Milan before eventually shooting in other locations in Italy including Rome, Florence and Lake Como. The film, due for release in October, is based on the book by Sara Gay Forden, The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour and Greed. It recounts the story of Reggiani, who hired a hitman to kill Gucci outside his office in Milan in 1995 after he went off with another woman. Reggiani, who was dubbed the \u201cBlack Widow\u201d by the Italian media during her high-profile trial, was released from prison in 2016 after serving 17 years of her 29-year sentence. Gucci, who was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, the founder of the fashion house, was 46 when he was shot dead. Reggiani said in a recent interview that she was so desperate to murder her estranged husband that she went around asking everyone if they could do it on her behalf, \u201ceven the local shopkeeper\u201d. She added that she needed a hitman as she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a good aim\u201d. Reggiani said on Thursday she was annoyed that Lady Gaga hadn\u2019t arranged to meet her before filming.

He was known for being charming and shrewd, had a talent for mimicry, and was once driven to Ascot to join the Queen because she was too busy enjoying the races to meet him at Buckingham Palace. Born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), Muttukumaru was the Queen\u2019s aide-de-camp in 1954. Now, almost 70 years on, and with the royal family caught in a race storm in the wake of the Oprah Winfrey interview with Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Muttukumaru\u2019s son Christopher spoke to the Guardian about his father\u2019s experiences. He described the friendship his father had with the Queen which endured for years beyond his time in service. \u201cYears later, whenever my father came to the UK to visit my family and me \u2013 long after he had any official position in the army or diplomatic service \u2013 the Queen would give him a private audience in Buckingham Palace,\u201d said Christopher, a former general counsel to the Department for Transport. \u201cThere was no need for her to do that \u2013 my father was just an ordinary member of the public by this time \u2013 but she made time in her diary for him from the 70s onwards.\u201d One year, when the Queen was at Ascot at the time of Muttukumaru\u2019s visit, her private secretary arranged for him and his wife to be driven to see her there. \u201cMy parents watched the races with the Queen in the royal box and my father won \u00a325 \u2013 which he was cock-a-hoop about because he didn\u2019t know the first thing about horse racing,\u201d Christopher said. The first Sri Lanka-born soldier to command his country\u2019s army, Muttukumaru read PPE at Jesus College, Oxford, in 1928 and became a lawyer at Gray\u2019s Inn before returning home in 1934. Muttukumaru joined the Ceylon Defence Force and at the outbreak of the second world war he was in charge of the South East Asia Command headquarters in Kandy.     Muttukumaru poses next to the Queen Mother in Canberra. The Australian PM, Harold Holt, and Muttukumaru\u2019s wife are to the left of the royal. Photograph: Family handout    After the war, Muttukumaru came to London to lead his soldiers in the victory parade. He returned six years later with his men for the funeral of George VI in 1952, and a third time a year later for the Queen\u2019s coronation. Hearing of his plan to attend her coronation, the soon-to-be Queen issued a personal invitation \u2013 couched as a command \u2013 to attend the service in Westminster Abbey. Muttukumaru, however, decided to march with his soldiers instead. According to his 2001 obituary in the Telegraph, the Queen forgave his refusal and, after later seeing his men mounting guard at Buckingham Palace along with her own guardsmen, congratulated him on the smartness of his men. \u201cRegarding the controversy over a member of the royal family asking (if true) about the colour of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s son, my point is that if she was somebody who harboured views about coloured or black people, it certainly didn\u2019t come through in her treatment of my father,\u201d Christopher said. Muttukumaru went on to become his country\u2019s high commissioner to Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan. In 1966 he became ambassador to Egypt. Four years previously he had hosted lunch for the Queen Mother in Canberra with his wife, Peggy, and the then Australian prime minister, Harold Holt.

For breakfast, we each had one doughnut. Then, throughout the morning, I popped into the kitchen a couple of times while I was working and helped myself to one. So far, so enjoyable. A little later, I walked into the kitchen to be greeted by an intervention. The concerned party, which comprised the rest of my family, informed me that they went to get a doughnut and saw that I had in fact eaten six of them. Before lunch! They were horrified. Immediately I knew two things: 1) I have a problem and 2) I definitely shouldn\u2019t tell them that I was going to the kitchen to get a seventh doughnut. I decided I needed to give up sugar. I realise this seems extreme, but I had read somewhere that if you stop eating sugar for a few weeks, the next time you eat a tangerine it will taste like a meringue. Or something. Basically, I wanted to reset my tastebuds. Some scientists have claimed sugar is as addictive as cocaine, and the more of it you get used to having, the more you need. I grew up in a house, and a time, where the true evils of sugar had not been realised. Instead, parents marvelled at sugar\u2019s incredible power to get children to eat stuff. We put it on cereal, we put it on fruit, we put it on bread and had sugar sandwiches. My mum saw it as a miracle ingredient. We used to have a fizzy drinks man who would come round and deliver various bottles, pretending not to notice how increasingly obese the kids of the house were getting every week. So I have always been aware that I eat too much sugar. But it took the Day Of Six (With Intent For Seven) Doughnuts to really shake me into taking action. I sought advice from a friend who told me he had given up through sheer willpower and a desire to get healthier. I asked him how he had managed to cut out cakes and biscuits, and he told me he still ate them all the time; he just meant he\u2019d stopped having sugar in coffee and tea. I realised he was a fraud who was wasting my time. Hardcore sugar abstainers give up not just sugar, but simple carbs, which turn into sugar, as well as processed food that has added sugar. They also immediately spit out anything that they start to enjoy, because that probably means it has sugar in it, too. I went for a more intermediate option: to avoid any added sugar, and to not have white bread, pasta or rice. My strategy was to keep it up for 10 days and then tuck into a piece of toast that would by then taste like gateau.   Related: I've become a serial takeaway eater. No shame. No guilt.

I started my day with water, chopped banana and porridge with no sugar (I usually add a half-litre of agave). Absolutely disgusting. For a mid-morning snack I had a sliced apple with some chilli powder (sounds crazy, but it\u2019s incredible) before a lunch of fairly plain vegetables. By late afternoon, I was absolutely battered. My head was thumping and I felt completely exhausted. My wife suggested I just cut down rather than go cold turkey. She offered me an Oreo. I ate it. I promise you, it was like a magic potion.

Admittedly, it wouldn\u2019t be part of your average Master of Wine\u2019s lexicon, but if someone tells me a wine is lush, I want to try it. And not just because I live in Bristol, where \u201cgert lush\u201d is the ultimate term of approbation. Anyway, having recently tasted a lot of whites I regarded as lush, I thought it might be an appropriate topic to return to for Mother\u2019s Day. Not that I am suggesting for a second that your mother is a lush, even if she does have a glass every night \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t blame her, given the unremitting tedium of the past 12 months. What makes a wine lush? It\u2019s a question of texture as much as anything: smoothness, richness, roundness, and no harsh edges. White wines such as pinot grigio and picpoul may be refreshing, but they\u2019re not lush. Nor, to my mind, are heavily oaked cabernets or the sort of light reds you can chill, much as I like them. As I thought more about this, it dawned on me that the grape varieties that are used to make sweet wines are often lush in their drier incarnations \u2013 semillon and sauvignon, the grapes that produce sauternes, for instance. In fact, sauvignon on its own can be, too, especially if it\u2019s packed with passionfruit and other tropical fruits, as it tends to be in New Zealand. Chenin blanc, the backbone of sweet Loire whites such as Quarts de Chaume and C\u00f4teaux du Layon, can be glorious \u2013 particularly as it ages. Aromatic wines such as riesling, pinot gris and gew\u00fcrztraminer, ditto. And I\u2019m a big fan of furmint, the grape used to make Hungary\u2019s famous sweet wine tokaji, although I admit \u201cHave a glass of furmint, Mum\u201d doesn\u2019t have quite the same ring as \u201cHave a glass of prosecco\u201d. Nonetheless, I suspect many mothers would enjoy a glass of F\u00fcleky Tokaji Furmint 2014 (13%), a delightfully exotic wine you can get for \u00a316.49 from Borders Wines in Coldstream. The downside is that lushness tends to come at a price. It\u2019s generally achieved through low-yielding vines and expensive oak barrels, but put that in context: you can easily pay \u00a330 for a bottle of champagne and, were we able to go to restaurants right now, you\u2019d likely be spending a similar amount on a house favourite.

Richards\u2019s first match as a fan was no ordinary one. It was the derby between Lanus and Banfield, Buenos Aires\u2019s Clasico del Sur, and it was always going to be an eye-opener; an assault on the senses. Thanks to a measure of naivety in the travelling American party, it would go further than that. \u201cOur colours for the US team were green and white and the away team for that game [Banfield] was green and white,\u201d Richards says. \u201cSo we pulled up in our big charter bus in our jackets and everyone was throwing stuff at our bus.

Richards would sign a four-and-a-half year contract with Bayern in January 2019. There have been numerous moments when Richards has needed to pinch himself, beginning with his involvement in the club\u2019s pre-season tour of the US in the summer of 2018; he featured against Juventus in Philadelphia and Manchester City in Miami. Richards played for the under-19s and Bayern II before he made his competitive first-team debut in the Bundesliga against Freiburg at the end of last season. This time out, there was a first medal when he came on in the German Super Cup victory over Borussia Dortmund while he mentions his first Champions League start against Red Bull Salzburg and his involvement against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. How could he fail to have been a little star-struck, particularly when he trained with the seniors for the first time in October 2018 and found himself up against Arjen Robben? \u201cYou know he\u2019s going to go left, you\u2019ve seen him through his whole career so I think: \u2018OK, let me push him to his right\u2019,\u201d Richards says. \u201cSo he makes one move to his right and back to his left and he\u2019s past you. You think: \u2018Ah, I\u2019ve just got chopped up by Arjen Robben,\u2019 and then you think that he\u2019s done this to the best defenders in the world for years. \u201cYou can\u2019t look at it in awe.

The competition makes everybody better so you try not to take it personally if there\u2019s a rough challenge. You want that spot, too, so you try to do it. Tempers do fray, definitely. If it\u2019s a younger player making a tackle on an older player, it\u2019s going to ruffle some feathers but, if it\u2019s the other way around, there\u2019s usually not too much said.\u201d Richards smiles his easy smile when it is put to him that US sports fans tend to live their stadium experiences differently to football fans in Europe and South America. \u201cFor the most part, there isn\u2019t this type of insanity with sports in the US,\u201d he says, although he does point out that American Football at college level is an \u201cobsession\u201d. It is sometimes said that Americans do not get football and Richards says he \u201ccould definitely agree with that\u201d. But things are changing, partly because of the success of the US Women\u2019s National Team and also because of the high number of young American players who have transitioned to clubs in Europe, many of them big ones. It has meant that matches are now more readily accessible on US television. Richards is not alone in the Bundesliga.

After eleventy billion days of locked down home schooling, the nine-year-old and his father went like lightning. The only thing faster was me shutting the door behind them. Back pressed firmly against it, I gazed about me in disbelief. A strange roaring filled my ears. It took me a moment to identify. It was actually the sound of silence. There was no shouting. No groans of boredom or despair. No exhortations to \u201cConcentrate!\u201d or \u201cJust do it!\u201d There was no weeping, child or adult. Just silence. I had a coffee. Quietly. I went up the stairs to my office, unencumbered. I did six hours\u2019 work uninterrupted.

I don\u2019t know why, at the age of 46, ringing any kind of authority to make any kind of request or complaint fills me with apprehension, stress and tearful anxiety, but it does. I have tried to unpack my own root issue here in the hope of addressing it, but whatever psychological blockage there is remains unyielding. All I can say is that I know I am not alone. My mother, sister and several friends suffer the same handicap. There\u2019s a fear of being told off mixed in there somewhere, a feeling that we\u2019re transgressing some unspoken law that we don\u2019t deserve help and should be able to manage without it.

I used to think holding the hands of children, tightly, would exempt you from the consideration of street abusers, but I\u2019ve long noticed that for some guys, it simply makes it more special. \u201cWhy was he doing it if you didn\u2019t say anything to him?\u201d wonders my son. I know! It does seem very irrational, doesn\u2019t it. What a silly man. \u201cHe\u2019s like The Angry Man,\u201d notes my son, which is what my children called some other guy who followed us down our own road screaming about something to do with their bikes.

In a tender falsetto, he calls for his \u201ctrumpet\u201d before unleashing a series of rhythmic vowel sounds: a fanfaring instrumental solo with only his own voice over a minimal backing. To those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, this is scat singing. And to hear it amid a loved-up ballad in 2021 begs the question: is scatting back?   Related: The Guide: Staying In  \u2013 sign up for our home entertainment tips    Loosely defined as vocal improvisations with a wordless melody, scatting is a term perhaps most readily associated with cartoonish imaginings of zoot-suited men snapping their fingers in smoky jazz bars. While it might seem like a lost musical artform, it has always existed in popular music beyond its native genre, jazz. Rapper Eazy-E channelled a horn-like scat in his 1990 track Eazy Street, while Busta Rhymes and Twista\u2019s hyperspeed flows often veer into scatting territory. In pop, Beyonc\u00e9 overlayed an electric guitar solo with a scat on 2011\u2019s I Care, while Amy Winehouse laced 2003\u2019s Frank with it. In R&amp;B, scatting finds its ultimate expression in Lalah Hathaway, who has pioneered a remarkable chordal voicing of the form. Of course, there was also the vocal acrobatics of Scatman John, whose novelty track Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop) conquered the charts in 1994. It could be argued that even the infernal ringtone-revving of the Crazy Frog owes its influence to scat singing.              Historically a cornerstone of the jazz singer\u2019s repertoire, the earliest recorded examples are thought to be found in a scratchy 1911 portion of the ragtime singer Gene Greene\u2019s King of the Bungaloos \u2013 a chaotic segment that veers from bouncy monosyllables to a gravelly Popeye impression \u2013 or Al Jolson\u2019s That Haunting Melody, which gives the scat a more languorous tone. It was not until the godfather of New Orleans jazz, Louis Armstrong, came along that scatting became a popular pursuit. His 1926 recording of the tune Heebie Jeebies saw Armstrong employ his signature baritone growl for a vocal improvisation. The song\u2019s ensuing popularity saw scatting incorporated into Armstrong\u2019s performances, while contemporaries such as Duke Ellington used scat sections as the core for compositions such as his Creole Love Call. Vocal powerhouses Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan transitioned from verse to scat solos in their songs, employing their liquid vocal skill to rival their backing bands. It is a tradition that has been continued by the likes of Al Jarreau and Don\u2019t Worry Be Happy singer Bobby McFerrin. In fact, the scat has never really left us: it lies dormant in the \u201c-ella\u2019\u2019 of Rihanna\u2019s Umbrella, in Jessie J\u2019s chaotic, meme-ready vocal freestyles, and in the nightmarish refrain of Baby Shark.

Ask Macron's ministers | Didier Fassin", "full_article": "Amid the crises of the last year, certain members of Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government have managed to identify a new threat to French society: \u201cIslamo-leftism\u201d. During a recent interview, the French minister of higher education, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Vidal, declared that \u201cIslamo-leftism corrupts all of society, and universities are not impervious\u201d. She criticised \u201cradical\u201d academics for always \u201clooking at everything through the prism of their will to divide\u201d, and announced that she would be requesting an investigation into university research on these subjects. While the meaning of the term is elusive, the political intent behind Vidal\u2019s statement was clear. \u201cIslamo-leftism\u201d, which Vidal has associated with research on race, gender and social class, is indicative of a broader culture war that is sweeping both the political and academic establishment in France. Vidal is not the only politician in Macron\u2019s government to have recently used the term. In a radio interview about the tragic beheading of a high-school teacher who had shown his class the Charlie Hebdo cartoons ridiculing the Prophet, Jean-Michel Blanquer, the minister of education, declared that \u201cIslamo-leftism wreaks havoc in universities\u201d, and blamed France\u2019s oldest national student union for being \u201cthe intellectual perpetrator of the assassination\u201d. In France\u2019s heated political climate, the ill-defined neologism has found an audience among mainstream politicians. The growing public presence of minorities demanding that their rights be respected, together with a burgeoning interest (particularly among younger scholars) in ideas and theories that help analyse religious prejudice, racial discrimination and social injustice, have disturbed a comfortable belief in the supposedly universalist values of the French republic. In response, a reactionary movement has emerged in France that crosses ideological lines between left and right, combining anxiety about an envisioned future with nostalgia for an imagined past. Although Macron distanced himself from Vidal after a scathing backlash to her proposed investigation, his apparent disapproval seems feigned; indeed, the French president has also singled out scholars working on racial discrimination and the stigmatisation of Muslims. Days before huge demonstrations took place against police violence and racism that resulted in multiple unpunished deaths of Arab and Black men across France, Macron accused universities of encouraging \u201cthe ethnicisation of the social question\u201d and \u201cbreaking the republic in two\u201d. Three months later, he announced a new law against Islamist \u201cseparatism\u201d that is designed to exercise greater control over Muslim schools and mosques. Although an Elys\u00e9e official said the bill is \u201cnot against Islam\u201d, but rather \u201cagainst people who in the name of a wrong or reconstructed vision of a religion behave in a way contrary to the republic\u201d, many French Muslims feel the new law will unfairly target them. It has been clear for some time that Macron\u2019s machiavellian calculation (the French president wrote his undergraduate dissertation on the author of The Prince) is that leading his party on the tails of the far-right will help him win against Marine Le Pen\u2019s Rassemblement National in the second round of the 2022 presidential election, which polls predict to be very close. Yet a narrowly political reading of terms such as Islamo-leftism misses the broader picture. The term is a signal not only to conservatives, but to an influential segment of French intellectuals. In recent years, a lively reactionary movement has taken off among French intellectuals, targeting research in a long list of fields \u2013 from ethnicity, race, gender and intersectionality to colonialism, decoloniality and Islamophobia. This movement is best understood as a rejection of the evolution of society, politics and ideas, and an endeavour to re-establish the old social and political order of things. It has rallied mostly senior or retired scholars, and while their targets are distinct, all are concerned with the same menace: the advent of what is often called \u201cidentity politics\u201d. From their perspective, race studies, research on racial discrimination and the idea of white privilege all pose a threat to the universalist values of the French republic. Some even see these ideas as forms of anti-white racism. They regard analyses of France\u2019s colonial past (which has long been a blind spot in French history and sociology) as divisive and ideological. Meanwhile, organisations such as the influential La Manif pour tous, which was founded in 2012 to oppose France\u2019s gay marriage bill, have taken a strong stance against education programmes covering gender studies. Curiously, France\u2019s culture warriors believe that these new ideas and critical theories are imported from US campuses. Yet race relations were initially studied in Britain, while the concept of \u201cdecoloniality\u201d was created in Latin America. And, ironically, many of the ideas that have been developed in North America were influenced by French theorists. A remarkable feature of this movement is its disregard for the international literature nourishing these new ideas. Instead of understanding them, it appears more interested in caricaturing them. A revealing example of this intellectual moment is the recently published book Race et Sciences Sociales by the sociologist St\u00e9phane Beaud and the historian G\u00e9rard Noiriel. These two respected scholars lament what they see as the substitution of \u201cclass struggle\u201d with \u201crace struggle\u201d. They scorn the \u201cgender bandwagon\u201d, are dismissive of intersectionality and criticise the \u201cracialisation\u201d of social problems and public discourse. Their book begins and concludes with the death of George Floyd. Of Black Lives Matter, they write that the movement obscures \u201cthe power relations structuring our societies\u201d,and therefore accentuates divisions among working-class people (a remarkable argument, given that Black Lives Matter has been more involved in deconstructing and denouncing power relations than any other social movement in past decades). By asserting the primacy of class, and an idealised account of republican values, France\u2019s culture warriors devalue the ideas and movements that help to better understand \u2013 and act against \u2013 current social injustices. Allegations of a menacing Islamo-leftism have revealed an improbable convergence between Macron\u2019s En Marche and Le Pen\u2019s Rassemblement National, on the one hand, and a reactionary segment of France\u2019s intellectual world on the other. Comparisons have been drawn by some between the term Islamo-leftism and Judeo-Bolshevism; both identify the leftwing followers of a particular religion. The latter term was however used in the 1930s to cast European Jews as dangerous subversives. Although history never repeats itself, witch hunts are never a good sign for democracy.

The song, performed by the five-piece group Galasy ZMesta, was chosen by Belarus\u2019s national broadcaster to compete in the Netherlands in May, rather than by a public vote as other entries have been in recent years. Galasy ZMesta have been vocal supporters of the Lukashenko regime, writing on their website that they \u201ccannot remain indifferent\u201d while protesters were \u201ctrying to break up the country we love and in which we live\u201d. The frontman, Dmitry Butakov, a former military translator, has said he has a \u201cSoviet\u201d mentality and still finds it hard to accept the collapse of the USSR.   Related: Belarus jails two journalists who covered Lukashenko protest    Mass protests broke out in the former Soviet state last summer when Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for 26 years, claimed victory in a rigged election. At one point the demonstrations seemed set to topple the regime, but police responded with a violent crackdown, torturing arrested demonstrators and forcing opposition figures into exile. Butakov described the Russian-language song as satirical and said it did not address the protest movement openly. But the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs the competition, said there was a political undertone to lyrics such as \u201cI\u2019ll teach you to walk on a string / You will be happy and glad about everything \u2026 I will teach you toe the line\u201d. In a statement, the EBU said it had \u201ccarefully scrutinised\u201d the entry to ensure it complied with the rules of the rules of the competition, which bans political statements. \u201cIt was concluded that the song puts the non-political nature of the contest into question.\u201d The EBU said Belarus would have to rewrite the song, find another entry, or face disqualification. The statement came as Belarusian officials said they had completed their investigation into Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of the opposition leader-in-exile Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who was jailed last May after he announced his intention to stand against Lukashenko for the presidency. He faces up to 15 years behind bars on charges of inciting mass unrest, following the jailing of a number of other activists and journalists. I\u2019ll Teach You is not the only entry to this year\u2019s Eurovision Song Contest to have caused controversy. In Cyprus, the Orthodox church has demanded the country withdraw the song El Diablo by Elena Tsagrinou, which it said promoted Satanic worship. Russia\u2019s selection of the Tajik-born singer Manizha to represent the country with Russian Woman, meanwhile, provoked a xenophobic backlash online, with some claiming a television vote had been rigged. Other conservative elements in Russia criticised Manizha\u2019s support for LGBTQ rights. Songs have banned from Eurovision before because of political content. In 2009, shortly after a war with Russia, Georgia was blocked from entering We Don\u2019t Wanna Put In, a barely veiled reference to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.

She said in a statement this week that the extraordinarily damaging allegations from the Sussexes \u2013 of racism and of emotional neglect that Meghan said had left her feeling suicidal \u2013 would be dealt with privately. \u201cThat should be a holding statement,\u201d said the royal historian and author Robert Lacey. \u201cThe next step is to say: yes, with regard to the personal family issues, we are working on that in private. But, we acknowledge there are issues of public accountability here.\u201d It\u2019s not just the aftermath of the Oprah Winfrey interview, Lacey said. Allegations that Meghan bullied staff are also in play. \u201cThis is about how this major institution of state, funded by the taxpayer, is actually organised. They should acknowledge: we have questions about HR policy. We have questions about our diversity. And we are going to handle those now, openly, in the way that any government department would. \u201cThis is an agency of the British government. It\u2019s more than people or a family. It\u2019s about an institution. If you look at Buckingham Palace\u2019s website, at its HR pages, they go into ecstasy about their wonderful human resources policy, and what you can expect if you join, and how much they care for their staff. It sounds like any modern American corporation on paper. But in practice it\u2019s just run in the old-fashioned way.\u201d The phrase \u201cthe firm\u201d has come to apply to the royal family and the institution around it \u2013 the \u201cmen in grey suits\u201d, as Diana, Princess of Wales coined it. The power behind the royals include Sir Edward Young, the Queen\u2019s private secretary, and Clive Alderton, a former diplomat and Prince Charles\u2019s private secretary at Clarence House. Following the Sussexes\u2019 claims of being marginalised within the institution, the spotlight is now on these figures as much as on the Queen, Charles and William \u2013 the latter making his thoughts clearly known when he told journalists: \u201cWe\u2019re very much not a racist family.\u201d How could they have failed to harness the potential of the campaigning, feminist Hollywood celebrity that was Meghan Markle, Lacey questioned. And now, it seems, according to another royal expert of longstanding, the narrative is set. \u201cIn a sense they have set the trajectory by not keeping the door ajar, not offering a way back in.\u201d The couple were stung by the way Buckingham Palace framed their permanent departure last month, especially with its statement that by stepping away from the work of the royal family \u201cit is not possible to continue with the responsibilities and duties that come with a life of public service\u201d. It was badly worded, suggesting they could only do public service within the royal family, said Lacey. Yet Harry and Meghan had spent the last year trying to undertake public service. \u2018That\u2019s what the argument\u2019s been all about,\u201d said Lacey. \u201cThose words seemed to misunderstand and misrepresent everything they had been trying to do in the best way.\u201d The couple\u2019s response was pointed and terse: \u201cWe can all live a life of service. Service is universal.\u201d Friends of the Sussexes indicate they will have no more to say, that nothing was left unsaid. \u201cI doubt there will be more, once you\u2019ve had that level of interview,\u2019 said one who knows them. They are \u201cfeeling free\u201d, the actor Janina Gavankar, a close friend of Meghan, has said. She watched the Oprah interview. \u201cNow they can get back to what they really were focused on,\u201d she said of their humanitarian and environmental work through their Archewell charitable foundation. Both are expected, throughout this month, to promote their International Women\u2019s Day campaign, which aims to \u201cunleash a groundswell of real acts of compassion for the women in your life and in your community\u201d, their website states. There is said to be relief \u2013 at having unburdened themselves, at getting it \u201cover and done with\u201d before they welcome their new daughter and become a family of four. Their profile in the US could not be higher. Support from celebrity friends has boosted the Meghan and Harry brand right across North America. Beyonc\u00e9 posted: \u201cThank you Meghan for your courage and leadership. We are all strengthened and inspired by you.\u201d Serena Williams wrote: \u201cMeghan Markle, my selfless friend, lives her life \u2013 and leads by example \u2013 with empathy and compassion. She teaches me every day what it means to be truly noble.\u201d \u201cThey [the Sussexes] should clearly shut up now,\u201d Lacey said. \u201cThey have said that\u2019s the end of it. Archewell is a positive innovation. They should get on with the doing, with less of the talking.\u201d The tit-for-tat media briefings should cease, critics say. Media leaking between rival royals was on a scale not witnessed since the \u201cwar of the Waleses\u201d between Charles and Diana. The fallout, however, is ongoing. \u201cI think their biggest unexploded bomb is their bullying investigation,\u201d said a royal watcher of long standing, referring to Buckingham Palace\u2019s inquiry into the handling of claims of alleged bullying of staff by Meghan, the results of which it has said will be made public. \u201cWhat are they going to do if people come forward and say \u2018I was bullied by X royal, or X senior member of staff\u2019? They will be desperate to keep as narrow a focus as possible. The risk is that it\u2019s not a discrete matter about Meghan and Harry, but also about how staff reacted at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House. And why are they doing it in-house? Why is an independent person not doing it?\u201d This crisis must jolt the institution towards change, said Lacey. Referring to the Queen\u2019s words that \u201crecollections may vary\u201d, which implied questions over the couple\u2019s account, was pointless, he said. \u201cHarry and Meghan have created a new and disturbing truth, and one that the monarchy now has to live with,\u201d he said.", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Women's Champions League: Man City take on Barcelona and Chelsea face Wolfsburg", "full_article": "Chelsea will play Wolfsburg and Manchester City will face Barcelona \u2013 the holders of the German and Spanish titles, respectively \u2013 in the quarter-finals of the Women\u2019s Champions League.

The property group, which also owns the Bicester Village designer outlet, said the closure of non-essential shops during lockdowns and the suspension of rent payments for struggling retailers in 2020 fuelled the biggest annual fall in rental income in company history. Annual losses more than doubled from \u00a3781m in 2019 to \u00a31.7bn last year. \u201cAs our results show, Hammerson was hit hard,\u201d said Rita-Rose Gagne, the Hammerson chief executive. \u201cOur immediate focus in 2021 is leading Hammerson through Covid-19 to safety. This means further disposals to strengthen the balance sheet, managing refinancing, and sharpening our operations to maximise income.\u201d The value of its property portfolio plunged by almost \u00a32bn, another record fall \u2013 from \u00a38.32bn to \u00a36.33bn \u2013 including a 36% decline across its flagship UK retail destinations. The company said part of the decline in the value of its portfolio was also due to the sale of some assets. Net rental income fell 41% to \u00a3157.6m, prompted by store closures, tenant restructuring deals and higher provisions for bad debt and tenant incentives. So far Hammerson has collected 76% of 2020 rent due. Earlier this week, the government extended a ban on evicting commercial tenants until the end of June, which landlords have said makes it harder to collect rent from those that can pay but do not.

It\u2019s empowering, and shows the genuine need for connection that people have at this point of isolation.\u201d The gallery had been mulling over the robot idea for some time; pre-pandemic, they had been thinking about how they could connect with children in a local hospice. \u201cOne of our trustees, Esther Fox, an incredible artist and a wheelchair user, wondered if we might offer robot tours,\u201d says Gilmore. \u201cShe knew the benefits of being transported somewhere you wouldn\u2019t physically be able to get to.\u201d When the pandemic hit, they pressed fast-forward on the project. Fast-track adaptation has also been the watchword for artists Ruth Gibson and Bruno Martelli. Producing multidisciplinary art under the name Gibson/Martelli, the London-based duo have worked together for more than 20 years, exhibiting at the likes of the Barbican Centre, the Venice Biennale and the Detroit Institute of Arts. \u201cWe were lucky in some ways, as our studio space is in our house, so we were able to keep working,\u201d says Martelli. The pandemic did, however, force them to make changes to a big project they had been working on for some time. Dazzle \u2013 inspired by the Dazzle ball, thrown in 1919 at the Royal Albert Hall \u2013 was meant to combine moving images, dance, sound art, fashion and virtual reality. Audience members, wearing virtual reality (VR) headsets, would be immersed in the event; while alongside avatars of performers, they would then feel a dancer \u2013 present in the physical space \u2013 touch them. But, despite the heavy use of digital technology, the project also relied on people occupying the same space, and costumes and headsets being worn by multiple attendees. Although Gibson/Martelli hope to create Dazzle in full in the future, they have meanwhile found a pandemic-ready solution: art show as computer game. \u201cIt\u2019s similar technology to a multiplayer first-person shooter game,\u201d says Martelli. \u201cIf you are the audience member at home, you get a ticket, download the software, put the headset on, go into VR \u2013 where you could also meet your friends \u2013 and have the experience.\u201d     Ruth Gibson and Bruno Martelli Photograph: No Credit     Ruth Gibson and Bruno Martelli  Partly funded by UK Research and Innovation, the Dazzle project was conceived as part of CreativeXR, a programme developed by Arts Council England and tech innovation centre Digital Catapult to support the creation of cultural experiences using immersive technology. But the reality of the pandemic also means the two artists needed to consider the human element more than ever. \u201cWe\u2019ve been really conscious of keeping everyone that\u2019s working on the project. It\u2019s hard for people like dancers, there\u2019s not a tonne of work around,\u201d says Martelli. They have also had performers help out in other areas, such as dealing with administration. For Hastings Contemporary, the robot and the attention it has generated has also provided a boost. Gilmore notes she\u2019s very grateful to be able to offer something to members who have continued paying their subscription fees throughout the pandemic. \u201cBecause the robot was partially funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council, we weren\u2019t in a position where we wanted to charge for the tours at this pilot stage,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we are interested in how all galleries might be able to monetise this and develop an income stream.\u201d     Gibson/Martelli\u2019s Dazzle project is available in VR Photograph: Courtesy of THAYAHT (6)     Gibson/Martelli\u2019s Dazzle project is available in virtual reality  Gilmore hopes that robot tours could be a fun experience for families or friends who can\u2019t be together physically, but also that, post-pandemic, they will be a way for people who can\u2019t get to the gallery for reasons of physical or mental health to be able to experience art. Both Hastings Contemporary and Gibson/Martelli have created ways of interacting with art that will outlast lockdown. At this stage, though, there is still a need for one member of the gallery\u2019s staff to accompany the robot. \u201cIt can glide on a flat surface, but not exactly with balletic grace,\u201d says Gilmore. \u201cAnd it still can\u2019t use the lift. We need a human to press the button.\u201d The British Business Bank is a government-owned economic development bank, helping thousands of businesses across the UK access the financial information and support that they need to get back on track.

But redesigning the interior of a home isn\u2019t just about changing the colour of the walls or moving furniture into new positions. It\u2019s also about the finer details \u2013 the grain in wood, the feeling when you sit down in a chair, how fabric feels under your fingers or how light falls through a window. Interior designers have to take into consideration a whole range of factors that make all the difference when it comes to spending time in a room. Given this, the digital video meetings we\u2019ve all become used to can only take a designer so far. Nonetheless, the sector itself is proving resilient; eight out of 10 people, according to a survey conducted by the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) in October, wanted to change their homes as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe impact of Covid-19 will affect how and where we choose to live for years to come,\u201d says Riba president Alan Jones. \u201cFor many of us, our homes are our sanctuaries, and this research indicates that many people are keener than ever to adapt and improve their homes.\u201d Many interior designers across the UK report an increase in the number of new clients they have taken on. But as the process relies so heavily on being physically present in a space, they have had to adapt.     Zoe Hewett Photograph: Emli Bendixen             Bristol-based designer Zoe Hewett: \u2018Creating nice places is what drives me\u2019  Zoe Hewett is no stranger to finding creative ways around problems. When she first started her interior design business, Stylemongers of Bristol, the former set designer for theatre and TV productions lacked the funds to make over her own home to serve as a showcase \u2013 so instead she built a doll\u2019s house to demonstrate her style. As a result of the pandemic, Hewett scaled back her face-to-face work, but has still found ways of expanding her business \u2013 one of which is a range of interior design kits to help people design their own homes. \u201cAt first, I was thinking about making my services accessible,\u201d she says. \u201cA one-to-one design consultation is worth doing for a bespoke service, but it\u2019s always going to be out of reach for some people, so I wanted to offer something affordable, at a price point more people could afford.\u201d The pandemic meant the project became a priority for her business, and the packs became a reality. \u201cI may have created an envelope-stuffing role for myself,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I love that people are getting something physical and tangible to work with.\u201d       Hewett\u2019s interior design kits have proved popular  The packs are made of recycled card and paper and are delivered in letterbox-sized packages. Hewett sees them as a way of sharing the information and techniques that she previously discussed in face-to-face workshops, where she would guide groups through the principles of interior design \u2013 from creating moodboards to where to place furniture. They contain, among other things, quizzes to help buyers explore design choices, advice on using colour and materials to create 2D-scale layouts of rooms, plus a link to an ebook with further information. Hewett says the take-up of the \u00a350 kits has been \u201cpretty good. I hope people find them fun as well as useful. One lady who bought one said she\u2019s using it again with her seven-year-old to reimagine their shed. Her daughter\u2019s got really into it, apparently.\u201d Hewett \u2013 who has recently taken part in a new BBC Two show, My Unique B&amp;B, where a team of designers make over glamping spaces \u2013 was able to move some of her consultation work online: \u201cBefore [the pandemic] hit, I had made a secret area of my website where people can download a questionnaire, to fill in and send back with photos,\u201d she says. \u201cI initially put it in place because I\u2019m a Send (special educational needs and disabilities) parent, so it was about being able to work around appointments or needing to do school pickups at the drop of a hat. In that way, I was already geared up to keep working when lockdown hit.\u201d From each commission, Hewett makes a donation to the homeless charity Crisis. \u201cCreating nice places is what drives me,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it makes sense to me to also help people who haven\u2019t got anywhere to live yet.\u201d     Liselle Milner. Photograph: Ben Mostyn/Guardian     Liselle Milner has a focus on using sustainable materials and secondhand or upcycled furniture  The community focus is also important to Liselle Milner of Zenterior Design, based in St Austell, Cornwall. She works with 12 others, including builders, carpenters and upholsterers, to create indoor and outdoor spaces and bespoke furniture, all with a focus on using sustainable materials. Much of her work involves second homes or holiday lets, so the owners have not been able to travel to meet her. \u201cWe\u2019ve always focused on the relationship with the client, getting an idea of exactly what it is they want and then making that happen, so to never meet someone face-to-face has been very odd,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough, if you are talking to someone via Zoom, there is the advantage of seeing their house in the background, so it\u2019s a very quick way of seeing what they already like.\u201d Milner uses a lot of secondhand or upcycled furniture \u2013 \u201cI want the space to look as amazing as possible for the budget we have\u201d \u2013 but her pre-pandemic visits to charity shops and auctions have been replaced by Facebook Marketplace, and ever-greater resourcefulness as a team.     The beach at St Austell. Photograph: Ben Mostyn/Guardian             Many of the properties Milner works on are second homes or holiday lets  \u201cWe\u2019re looking at things we would usually outsource, like quilting, for example, and thinking: \u2018Can we do that ourselves?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s good creatively, and it also means we can keep to a schedule. Big furniture retailers have set specifics they work to. If a piece is made of oak, and if the oak isn\u2019t there, then that sofa won\u2019t be with you in 12 weeks\u2019 time. But if we are making it, then we can use beech or another suitable wood that we can actually get hold of.\u201d Besides changing their ways of working to comply with pandemic-related restrictions, such as visiting sites individually instead of together, the Zenterior team have also adapted some of the other physical parts of their jobs, finding ways to keep to social distancing rules, and have stopped working on occupied domestic properties. Milner has also doubled down on Zenterior\u2019s commitment to using local suppliers, not only to avoid delays with supply chains but also from a sense of local responsibility, as the regional tourism sector has been hit especially hard by restrictions on movement. \u201cAnd there\u2019s also the fact that Cornwall has always been a hub for artists and creative people. It makes sense to work with people who are here,\u201d says Milner. The pandemic may have affected their traditional ways of working for now, but both Milner and Hewett are determined that its lasting effects on our homes are sustainably positive.

The Irish actor, famous for his neckchain and his leading role in Normal People, was in Sydney, Australia, for a new film, and the word was spreading. He was photographed running in Centennial Park. He was sighted at Tamarama Beach. He popped into an inner-city pub. But on the list of stars now working in Australia, Mescal \u2013 in Sydney for a musical film adaptation of Carmen \u2013 is comfortably mid-level. Thanks to its relative freedom from Covid-19 and associated restrictions, Australia \u2013 blessed with diverse locations, sunny weather and a ready-made film infrastructure \u2013 has become Hollywood Down Under. Here for the latest instalment of Marvel\u2019s Thor franchise are Natalie Portman, Matt Damon, Tessa Thompson, Chris Pratt, Christian Bale, the New Zealand director Taika Waititi and the Australian star Chris Hemsworth. Fellow Australian Isla Fisher and her husband, Sacha Baron Cohen, have relocated their family to Sydney, where the pair first met 20 years ago. Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban came back too. Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton were in the country earlier in the year to film Three Thousand Years of Longing. Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson just wrapped in Queensland for the sitcom Young Rock. Zac Efron moved for the lifestyle first, then let the projects follow. When the news came on Wednesday that George Clooney and Julia Roberts would soon be joining their peers in the sun, the film\u2019s title was as apt as A Star is Born, as subtle as Sharknado. It\u2019s called Ticket to Paradise. \u2018Like a time machine\u2019 The areas that these stars flock to \u2013 Byron Bay, Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, Sydney \u2013 are beach-fringed and beautiful. They are also Covid-free. New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia, has gone 54 days without a community-acquired case of the virus, and Queensland has racked up 64. California, meanwhile, recorded 3,518 new cases on Thursday and 268 deaths.      Byron Bay, New South Wales. Photograph: Peter Harrison/Getty Images    Many of the stars have quarantined in luxury mansions or rolling country estates, with special exemptions that let them skip the hotels and state police and instead hire private security to enforce their isolation. As of this month, Efron was living in a \u201cluxurious yet dated\u201d four-bedroom property in the \u201cSpanish-mission style\u201d in Sydney, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Damon, when he arrived in January, reportedly spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on private doctors, hospital-grade cleaning and guards, and issued a public statement saying he was determined to help keep Covid out and maintain Australia\u2019s reputation as \u201cthe lucky country\u201d. As Broadway shows shuttered and the studios of Hollywood lay under lock and key, filming in Australia has been a surreal experience for both sides of the equation. Portman told the chatshow host Jimmy Kimmel that Australia was \u201clike a time-machine\u201d, an alien, upside down world where \u201call the trees are different\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s multicoloured parrots flying around like pigeons\u201d.

In Sydney, Waititi has been filming the Marvel epic seemingly everywhere \u2013 at Fox Studios, at Centennial Park and on golf courses. For many residents, the frenzy has focused on the mundanity of faraway stars caught in the middle of everyday Australian life. A shot of the cast of Thor holding an umbrella from Bunnings Warehouse, a beloved Australian home and garden emporium, sent many minds into overdrive. Paparazzi shots of Portman wielding a trolley on an escalator at a shopping centre were treated like modern art.

The possible challenge comes at a time of mounting concern about the police and the government using the pandemic to curtail the right to protest. In normal times, what is the right to protest? Assembling with other people for a common purpose is considered a cornerstone of democracy. This right to protest is protected by the Human Rights Act under articles on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. The police have a duty to uphold these individual rights and must take steps to enable peaceful protests. But the right to protest is a qualified right not an absolute one, which means the authorities can restrict it if they can show their action is proportionate and in the public interest. Do the coronavirus rules ban protests? The ban on meeting up with more than one other person outside, and previous limits on the numbers allowed to gather, appears to represent a blanket ban on organising or taking part in protests. This has never been tested in court, so the law is unclear. What powers can the police use to stop protests? Under the coronavirus regulations, the police can issue a fine of \u00a310,000 for anyone organising a gathering of more than 30 people in a public place. Dozens of such fines have been issued in the past few months for people organising parties, raves and protests. The police can also issue fixed-penalty notices to anyone taking part in such gatherings. What happened during last summer\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests? The killing of George Floyd by American police prompted tens of thousands of people to take to the streets in the UK in support of black people\u2019s rights. Hundreds of people were arrested during the demonstrations and many were subjected to police tactics such as kettling. The home secretary, Priti Patel, claimed many people taking part were \u201cthugs and criminals\u201d, and she told parliament that the demonstrations were illegal. What is Reclaim These Streets? It is a campaign group that wants to hold a gathering on Clapham Common and a minute of silence to remember Sarah Everard and all women lost to violence. It describes itself as a \u201cgroup of women who wanted to channel the collective grief, outrage and sadness in our community\u201d. Is it allowed to hold the vigil? Initially the Met told the group it was \u201ctrying to navigate a way\u201d to allow the vigil to take place. But on Thursday the police said the planned gathering would be unlawful and their \u201chands [were] tied\u201d by Covid regulations. After a crowdfunding campaign, human rights lawyers acting for the group challenged this interpretation of the rules. They are seeking a high court order confirming that the Met\u2019s understanding of the law is wrong. Does the government want to curtail the right to protests? Human rights campaigners say yes. They are concerned that ministers are using the pandemic as a pretext to severely weaken the right to protest. They are particularly alarmed by this week\u2019s police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, which would give the home secretary power to create laws to define \u201cserious disruption\u201d that police could then use to impose conditions on protests. These fears were underlined when plans for policing protests outlined the \u201cneed to develop\u201d covert intelligence methods, and cited the use of facial recognition technology \u2013 despite a ruling that this breached privacy rights.", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Robin Wendt obituary", "full_article": "My father, Robin Wendt, who has died aged 80, had a long and distinguished career in central and local government, including as a senior civil servant, chief executive of a county council and head of two bodies representing local authorities.He was born in Preston into a Methodist family. His father, Bill, was a local government accountant and his mother, Doris (nee Glover), was a schoolteacher. Educated at Hutton Grammar school and Wadham College, Oxford, where he studied PPE, in 1962 Robin joined the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, which later became the Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS). During those early days in London, he met Prue Dalby, a photographer, at Hinde Street Methodist church in Marylebone, and they married in 1965. Robin became principal private secretary to the Labour social services secretary Richard Crossman and, in the civil service tradition, also to his Conservative successor, Keith Joseph, after the 1970 general election. He subsequently rose to be assistant secretary at the DHSS. In 1975 he moved to become deputy secretary at Cheshire county council, taking promotion to chief executive four years later at the age of 38 and skilfully helping to guide the authority during a period when no party had overall control. When he returned to work in London in 1989 as secretary and de facto chief executive of the Association of County Councils, he steered the ACC through a turbulent period, helping to counter suggestions in a local authority review that county councils should be abolished in favour of creating smaller unitary authorities.  He was appointed CBE in 1996, and when the ACC merged with its counterparts for metropolitan and district councils to form the new Local Government Association in 1997, Robin joined the National Association of Local Councils \u2013 representing parish and town councils \u2013 as its chief executive for two years before taking early retirement. Settling back in Cheshire, where he had been appointed deputy lieutenant in 1990, Robin threw himself into a host of local causes, and chaired the Chester summer music festival for eight years to 2008. He also served as a member of the Royal Commission on Long-term Care for the Elderly at the end of the 1990s, as a board member of the charity Action for Children (1997 to 2008) and as a member of the Social Security Advisory Committee for 20 years to 2002.  Robin and Prue enjoyed travel to far-flung destinations, including Antarctica, but he was never happier than when at home, reading political biographies while listening to classical music and following the fortunes of Preston North End football club and Lancashire\u2019s county cricketers. He was also a frequent contributor to the Guardian letters page, often on the subject of the values of public service.

Some of the women sobbed as they embraced the bemused toddlers, who stared at them blankly not recognising their mothers, or understanding what the fuss was about. One mother stood motionless with her head in her hands, while another stared intently into her tiny daughter\u2019s eyes. The nine mothers, all members of the Yazidi community, and their children, all born to the terrorists who enslaved them, had been reunited for the first time since the collapse of Islamic State in early 2019. And after two years of preparing for such a moment, the women were about to make the most momentous decisions of their lives. The extraordinary scenes at the Iraq-Syria border crossing last Thursday were the culmination of months of lobbying by officials, including from the Biden administration, protracted debates among the Yazidi community and the determination of young mothers cruelly stripped of the children born to them to reclaim what was theirs, no matter the price.     A Yazidi woman who decided to reunite with her daughter in defiance of her community shows a necklace she bought the previous day as a gift for her. Photograph: Achilleas Zavallis/The Guardian    Each of the women had used an excuse to slip away from their family. The last time most of them had been at Samalka, they had been rescued from the giant al-Hol refugee camp in eastern Syria where the remnants of Isis\u2019s collapsed so-called caliphate were collected. The Yazidi were allowed to return to Iraq, but their children were seized from them before the border and taken to an orphanage. Yazidi elders had since refused to allow the children to join their mothers. To the community, the children were outcasts who ccould never be assimilated into Yazidi society. The unwritten reckoning was that if the mothers chose their children, they would need to forgo their community. Until last week, it appeared unlikely that the women, all aged between 19 and 26, would ever be able to make such a decision. The children had been banned from entering Iraq and only a few mothers had been able to enter Syria on day passes to visit the orphanage. Then came a convergence of people and circumstances, which made the seemingly impossible suddenly doable. Nemam Ghafouri, an organiser of the Yazidi mothers and the founder of Joint Help for Kurdistan, an NGO, received a phone call from the former US diplomat and long-term contact of Kurds on both sides of the border, Peter Galbraith. The Syrian Kurds were prepared to do a deal, he told her, and he was flying to Erbil to make it happen. Galbraith had worked on the Senate foreign relations committee for 14 years and has been a friend of Joe Biden since 1980. Like him, the new US president had taken an interest in Kurdish issues. The calculation on both sides of the border was that doing business on an issue such as this might pave the way for more extensive reengagement after the turmoil of the Trump years.   map   \u201cI asked Nechirvan Barzani [the president of the Kurdish regional government] to talk to Mazloum Abdi [the commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces] and he agreed,\u201d he said. After fraught discussions throughout Wednesday during which Galbraith called the White House to secure the transfer, Syrian Kurdish officials bundled the 12 children \u2013 who could all be definitively linked to the nine mothers waiting for them \u2013 into a minibus, and headed for the border. Ghafouri, who had been waiting with the mothers in a hotel, brought them to the border, and waited. In the following hours, officials in Kurdish Iraq demanded to know the provenance of the children, before clearing the mothers to reclaim them.  The women had been enslaved in their early teens from the community of Sinjar, which bore the brunt of the Isis genocide, and had stayed with the group throughout its rise and fall. Some of the mothers did not know who the fathers of their children were. \u201cPeople need to realise why some of these women have such bonds with their babies,\u201d said Ghafouri. \u201cWhen they got pregnant, it meant the end of selling and raping by new men. This child brought an end to part of their suffering. Once being pregnant and giving birth, it was the end of it. The mother stayed with one man until he was killed.\u201d By midnight last Thursday, the mothers were on their way to a prearranged safe house.     One of the children who was reunited with her mother. Photograph: Family Handout    But news of the reunions has been met with anger by leaders of the Yazidi community. \u201cWe don\u2019t accept this. This should be a Yazidi nation decision,\u201d said Prince Herman, a representative of the senior Yazidi leader Prince Hazem. \u201cThe mothers are always welcome to come back home, but the children are not accepted. They can give their children to whomever they want, but they cannot live with us. \u201cThose people who brought back those children without asking Yazidis, or Yazidi leaders, will pay the price for what they did. There is no difference between those missionary NGOs and Isis, because they are playing with our girls and taking them from us. The Yazidi spiritual leader, Sheikh Ali Ilyas, otherwise known as Bab Sheikh, said the women were now exiled. \u201cNeither me or the Yazidi community will accept those children,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are free to go wherever they want, except our community. They are no longer our issue and are free to make their own decisions.\u201d In the safehouse, raucous sounds of children playing echo over two floors. Eight mothers have moved into the house, with one returning to her family in a refugee camp. Those who stayed have crossed the Rubicon, and are now looking for relocation to Europe or Australia. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure what I\u2019d do until I saw my daughter again,\u201d said one of the mothers. \u201cI love my mother a lot and know what this means for me. But I love my daughter too. I want a new start.\u201d A second mother said she was overwhelmed by the support she had felt over the past week and now realised she needed to cut ties with her society. \u201cI have family living abroad, and even they won\u2019t accept me. This has to change, and we\u2019re going to make it happen. When I told my parents, they said \u2018you are no longer a member of our family\u2019. \u201cI am very happy that I am with her. At first she didn\u2019t recognise me, but it\u2019s getting better day by day. When I came back after being separated, and I realised the community wasn\u2019t accepting us, I decided to make my life my daughter. Children are innocent. They haven\u2019t made any mistakes.\u201d Yazidis have been granted resettlement in Europe and elsewhere, but the issue of children born to Isis remains vexed for governments. \u201cThey have no safe place not only in Iraq but in the entire Middle East,\u201d said Ghafouri. \u201cThe only thing they want is to be resettled as a group in a third country. This has been an infected wound for the Yazidi community. The only healing is reuniting those mothers who want their children and resettle them. \u201cWe need to find solutions now. I don\u2019t necessarily blame Yazidi communities or Kurdish communities in either Iraq or Syria, but I do blame the UN and the international community. They are victims again being victimised by those people saying they are supporting them, but not doing anything.\u201d Additional reporting by Barzan Salam", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Anne Suddick obituary", "full_article": "My friend Anne Suddick, who has died aged 72 of heart failure, was a passionate coordinator of support for miners\u2019 families in County Durham during the 1984-85 national miners\u2019 strike. She worked hard to make sure families did not go hungry during the strike, was a founder member of Women Against Pit Closures in 1984, and was active in the National Justice for Mineworkers campaign for many years. Anne was born in East Hedley Hope, County Durham, to John Suddick, a labourer, and his wife, Violet (nee Goodliff). Anne\u2019s childhood was shaped by her father\u2019s ill health from a respiratory illness. Cast as the main breadwinner, her mother became housekeeper to a GP in Cornsay Colliery, Durham. Living in the doctor\u2019s home, with access to an extensive library, Anne developed a love of learning that stayed with her. She left school at 15 and took a secretarial course at Durham Technical College. Initially she went to work as a clerk at a local garage but in 1969 she became PA to the union officials of the Durham Colliery Mechanics\u2019 Association, part of the National Union of Mineworkers. Following the death of her sister, Jean, after childbirth in 1983, Anne looked after Jean\u2019s two children for several years until their father remarried.  When the miners\u2019 strike began in March 1984, she decided to try to make sure no family in Durham\u2019s former scattered mining communities was left without support. That May, Anne organised a meeting at Durham Miners\u2019 Hall, Redhills, to bring together activists, launching the county-wide Miners\u2019 Support Group. A powerhouse of an organiser and natural leader, she made an effective coordinator. Anne drew people together and engendered feelings of solidarity. One of her many projects was a \u201ctoy and turkey\u201d appeal, which provided the families of striking miners with food and a present that difficult Christmas. The support group became a well-oiled machine, raising and fairly distributing enormous amounts of money. Following the strike Anne continued her activism locally and nationally, forming links with campaigners from a range of causes, including at the women\u2019s peace camp at Greenham Common, which she visited frequently.  She remained in her job until made redundant in 1987. Following this, her health deteriorated but she acted as an informal welfare rights worker in her community.  She took a degree in sociology at Durham University, graduating in 1990. She was part of a local heritage group and visited schools encouraging children to understand the local mining heritage. She was also a member of the women and mining research group at Northumbria University, and wrote poetry. In 2007 she organised an exhibition in the village of Langley Park called Mining Memories, involving the local community and schools. She is survived by her nephew, David, and niece, Helen.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "From Soul Train to Beyonc\u00e9: the joy of black performance in America", "full_article": "When I began A Little Devil in America, I was thinking about Josephine Baker. The title of the book comes from Baker, from her speech at the March on Washington in 1963. It is a speech that is often overlooked. The legacy of the march so often centres on its male speakers (Martin Luther King Jr, A Philip Randolph), and Baker was well past her most notable prime. At 57, she chose to return to the US from France and make a small speech \u2013 but also to confront the country she\u2019d left and vowed to not return to. The speech is at times tender, at times funny, at times teeming with rage. There was a fullness to it; Baker considering the vastness of her life and the many lives she\u2019d lived. Her speech is defiant and brilliant, punctuated by Baker aligning her experiences with the national plight of black people in America:  You know, friends, that I do not lie to you when I tell you I have walked into the palaces of kings and queens and into the houses of presidents. And much more. But I could not walk into a hotel in America and get a cup of coffee, and that made me mad. And when I get mad, you know that I open my big mouth. And then look out, \u2019cause when Josephine opens her mouth, they hear it all over the world.      Josephine Baker, 1925. Photograph: Estate of Emil Bieber/Klaus Niermann/Getty Images    Baker was important for me when thinking about this book, because what is it to honour a life, if you do not attempt to honour the completeness of a life? What is a life \u2013 particularly a black life \u2013 in a moment that is not desirable to the constructs of whiteness, or a life that must exist and live on even when the limited imagination of whiteness is done with it. What was most gratifying about Baker\u2019s speech, looking back on it now, is how it uses her personal history to clarify for the crowd that the America they\u2019re living in isn\u2019t that different from the America she felt compelled to escape. The America where she was kicked out of hotels she was later asked to perform in; the America where she would light up a stage but not be able to get a drink at the bar. Because Little Devil centres on black performance as it relates to America and the American memory, it felt vital to understand Baker\u2019s Washington speech as an indictment of the US\u2019s obsession with forgetting and reframing its histories, in the hopes that it will never be found out. But the thing is that a great many of us have found it out already. The spirit of Toni Morrison hovers over the book, even though she is not in it. My first impulse was to write a different book. I was interested in the appropriation and transformation of legacies. I had spent some time in Memphis in 2015, and while there, I\u2019d been in the old Stax building, now a soul music museum. I saw the custom Cadillac Eldorado that Isaac Hayes loved so much. He had received it as part of a deal in 1972, but then went bankrupt and lost it years later. And now it sits in a museum, detached from the artist who loved it, a somewhat comical artefact. I began to think about the legacy and treatment of black artists in a place like Memphis, where people line up to get into Graceland, to revel in the safe and sanitised legacy of Elvis Presley. And so I set out to write an account that was initially propelled by a rageful curiosity. About what can be taken, and what was owed. Americans love to ask questions about the separation of artists from their art, as though it is the great complex inquiry of our time, but the country has extracted black art from black artists without honouring the humanity of the artmakers for years. I thought, initially, that if I set out on a scorching path to unearth the core discomforts I had with this dynamic, something would be revealed to me that might allow me to make peace \u2013 with what, or whom, I wasn\u2019t sure. I was seeking a broad, vague comfort. And then Morrison died, when I had pretty much a draft of the book that I felt fine with, but wasn\u2019t entirely in love with. It was a book of inquiries that felt braided together in a kind of infinity loop of noise, and when I came out the other side of it, I was hungry for more noise. It was occurring to me that all of the answers I needed were already embedded in America\u2019s history and relationship to black people, and that all of my digging, while not entirely futile, was not serving my actual interests.    The book is a catalogue of excitements \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Super Bowl show, Dave Chapelle\u2019s standup    Morrison often spoke of black writers detaching themselves from an investment in whiteness, and the ideas of whiteness; to ask the question of how the work might be better served if it was not catering to even the presence and potential presence of whiteness. I\u2019d realised that so much of the book, then, was operating in fear. It was using the ominous nature of what could be uprooted and repurposed as a tool of propulsion, and that isn\u2019t what I thought was most fascinating about my pursuits in the moment.           The Soul Train line dance to Jungle Boogie (1973).    What also happened around this time was that I had been sent a hard drive from an old pal. It had an immense archive of Soul Train episodes from the 1970s and 80s. I hadn\u2019t asked for this, I\u2019d just told my friend that I thought I needed to take the work in a more celebratory direction, and this is what he sent. For weeks, I spent hours watching clips. The ecstasy that poured over a room when a performer hit a good groove, or when an interview went in an especially salacious direction. And yes, of course, the beauty of the Soul Train line in all of its glory \u2013 dancers showing off their moves as they strut towards the camera - specifically in the 70s, when the construct of the line could be overburdened with joy and come apart, despite itself, flowing bodies on top of bodies for the sake of fighting for a little dance floor to move upon. It was there, my nightly baptism in the glow of a television screen carrying me back to a place of pleasure, that I decided what I was actually aching for was a book about celebration, about revelling in the many revelations I came towards while watching black people move. Or when thinking about the joy in black people throwing down playing cards on a flat surface. Or when thinking about the moment during \u201cGimme Shelter\u201d when Merry Clayton must have felt touched by God, entirely invincible. This was what my actual interests were reaching towards. The idea of celebration without consequence. The type of small performances that, even if they could be mimicked, could never be rightfully done by anyone but us. It was good, for example, to also consider the funeral. A point of grief that I had known many black people to turn into a celebration. To manipulate the idea of loss into something immensely fluorescent and immediately joyous. I had so loved witnessing Aretha Franklin\u2019s funeral and this idea that love means fighting to keep someone alive. The funeral that turns into a concert, into a dance party, into a revelation.     Beyonc\u00e9 performs during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2016. Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images    There are those who might call this book an archival project, and I think that is generous but also would maybe do a disservice to archivists, who dedicate entire lifetimes to this type of work. I think, instead, the book is a catalogue of excitements \u2013 Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Super Bowl show, Dave Chapelle\u2019s standup. I allowed myself the freedom to jump from place to place, from idea to idea, from emotion to emotion. I wanted to populate these essays with as many people as I could, as many images, as many magazine covers and songs and music videos and dance moves as I could. In the end, I return to Josephine Baker, as I did when I\u2019d changed the direction of the book and had to decide how to shift the tone of some of the pieces I\u2019d already written. I thought the best story to tell about Baker was the story of her coming home, which to me also is the story of what it is to love a place that was not constructed with the interests of serving you. Some might say there is a triumph in overcoming that set of circumstances. But I came to understand the triumph in losing interest in the serving of circumstantial geographies, and instead finding some ground on which you can perform in whatever way serves you, serves your people, serves the terms you wish to engage with.  \u2022 A Little Devil in America: Notes in Praise of Black Performance is published by Allen Lane (\u00a318.99).

The novel grips from the start, exploring with deceptive simplicity issues ranging from the difficulties of communicating with the people we love to colonisation on a planetary scale. It opens in a traditional English village pub, run by Jem, who has returned home from a 10-year posting to the planet Qita with a Qitan called Isley. Although there is a spaceport nearby, the villagers have nothing to do with it; they belong to the Western Protectorate, a region of Britain that chose to divorce itself from the complications of the modern world and adopt a simpler way of life. But even they cannot escape the consequences of humanity\u2019s contact with aliens who only appear to be human, as the truth about the Qitan lifecycle, and the imported psychedelic brew served by Jem from under the bar, is gradually revealed. I was reminded of the authors who first got me hooked on science fiction with their combination of deep humanity, brilliant storytelling and wild imagination: writers such as Theodore Sturgeon, Kate Wilhelm and Ursula Le Guin. Skyward Inn feels like an instant classic of the genre.     Birds of Paradise  Photograph: PR    Adam, the biblical first man, \u201ccreated before death\u201d and therefore immortal, is the hero of Birds of Paradise by Oliver K Langmead (Titan, \u00a38.99). By the 21st century, he has little affection for his many descendants, preferring to spend his time with other immortals: the original creatures he had the privilege of naming. Crow, Magpie, Raven, Owl, Butterfly and Pig generally hang out with him in human form, but occasionally find it useful to revert to type. He thinks about Eve, but not until the end of the book does he remember why she is no longer beside him. There is a plot about the search for immortal plants, and competing attempts to recreate the original Garden in present-day Britain, and it is all very vividly written \u2013 but I couldn\u2019t help feeling it would make more sense as a graphic novel: fantastic and colourful, but lacking depth. I could also have done without Adam\u2019s shooting spree: the old western trope of the good man driven to pick up his guns should have been put to rest long before now.     The Echo Wife Photograph: PR    Sarah Gailey has been nominated for Hugo and Nebula awards; their domestic thriller The Echo Wife (Hodder, \u00a317.99) begins as scientific superstar Evelyn discovers that her husband has been cheating on her \u2026 with her own clone. Evelyn has come up with a way to grow adult clones from a DNA sample, capable of speech and understanding, the original\u2019s personality imprinted on their brains. Legally they are not people, merely disposable tools. The horror of a society that would allow this is never touched upon, nor are there any moral or economic arguments made for their use. The plot is even more full of holes: Evelyn is a genius, yet her husband (a mere academic) not only runs with her idea, he manages to secretly produce her clone in his spare time. Gailey\u2019s main concern is showing how people are shaped by others, so Evelyn often recalls her cold, brutal father, and hates her clone for being the softer, gentler version her husband wanted, but the novel doesn\u2019t rise above the banal.      Sylvain Neuvel\u2019s A History of What Comes Next (Michael Joseph, \u00a314.99) is alt-history with a difference. It basically traces the true story of the development of rocket science, namechecking the real people involved in the days before the space race, but adds an alien-conspiracy-theory edge in the shape of a fictional team of mother-daughter clones, reborn through the ages with three imperatives: \u201cPreserve the knowledge; survive at all costs; take them to the stars\u201d. Along with the usual problems faced by women trying to change the world (or at least get men to listen to them), they are threatened by a mysterious \u201cTracker\u201d who has spent centuries trying to kill them. All good fun, and since this book takes us only up to 1961, we can expect more to come.     A Desolation Called Peace Photograph: PR    Arkady Martine\u2019s debut, A Memory Called Empire, won the Hugo award for best novel last year; A Desolation Called Peace (Tor, \u00a316.99) is the sequel \u2013 and obviously not the best place to start. I had no idea what the hugely significant events were that had taken place in the Teixcalaan Empire three months earlier, causing all the characters to be sad, or traumatised, or simply reflective, so it took quite a while for the story to take off. At the same time, new readers will be plunged, unprepared, into the strangeness of a space-faring empire somehow grown out of the ancient Aztec culture \u2013 a fascinating creation that soon had me hooked.

And to good effect. Deprived of crowds, staging or a wider emotional palette, that basic outline \u2013 38 points down on last year; 68 home games unbeaten versus six defeats in six \u2013 has captured the starkness of a complete sporting immolation. This is a train that has simply stopped. Better to burn out than fade away, and it has to be said no one has ever won and then lost the Premier League title quite like this. It is easy to forget that 14 games and nine wins into the current season Liverpool were five points clear at the top of the table.   Related: Fabinho back in his rightful midfield role and all is well for Liverpool | Jonathan Liew    After which, the meltdown. The next 14 have brought three wins and eight losses. Thirty-six goals in the first 14 games has shrunk to just 11 in the second. Jordan Henderson hadn\u2019t lost in the league at Anfield since January 2017. In February he played in three defeats in three weeks. What kind of team does this? And more to the point, why? Over time the wider details of exactly what happened here will emerge. Our 12-volume Warren report awaits. What we have so far are ground-zero stills, our own live rolling Zapruder footage. One thing does stand out. A brilliant team built out of J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s own restless energy have come to resemble a band of hollow men limping from stage to stage, but the manager has been more or less silent on the causes. Instead he has looked uneasy, an ancient mariner stalking the fringes \u2013 a little haunted and hollow-eyed, but passing for now on the discharge of blame. This is significant in its own right. Klopp analyses, and overanalyses. He will have his own very clear version of events. But right now he just isn\u2019t telling.     J\u00fcrgen Klopp is not inclined to cast blame on others in order to preserve his own reputation. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters    With good reason, too. Not just because Klopp is a fundamentally decent man, not naturally inclined to burn it all down in the hope of preserving his own reputation. But this is also a story that points into some difficult areas. It has been tempting to look for intangible causes, some kind of dark magic at play. In dank corners of the internet it has been suggested that ending that 30-year wait for a title has brought its own ill wind, strange humours, some kind of avenging emotional payback. In reality this has been a matter of structure and planning, of cause and effect. This was always a project built on the finest margins, a pared-back punkish setup, a team built to play in a way that would eventually stretch them to the edge of their own capacities. Not to mention a team built to feed on the synergy with their home crowd, and to chase the grail of another league title. What happens when both those things are wiped away at a stroke? This is why Klopp gets a pass here. What this season\u2019s collapse tells us is that this model has built-in limits and brutally fine margins for error. In many ways it casts an even more favourable light on Klopp\u2019s achievement in building that team in the first place.    An unspoken truth about Klopp\u2019s title-winning Liverpool is that they don\u2019t contain many obviously great individuals    To get the clearest view it is worth going back to where this began. Klopp\u2019s team found their definitive shape in the spring of 2018, not long after the departure of Philippe Coutinho and the arrival of Virgil van Dijk. That February Liverpool went to Porto and won 5-0, a giddy, gleeful kind of game where suddenly the front three, the full-backs, the midfield axis were all in place and it all looked thrillingly slick, a team fizzing with possibilities. A month later Mohamed Salah scored four in the 5-0 defeat of Watford. A month after that Liverpool went 3-0 up in half an hour against Manchester City, the acme of that attacking blitz style. From there a 97-point league season in 2018-19, with the Champions League won, bled straight into the title-winning year. A peak arrived with the World Club Cup victory and the breathless return, crown slung over one shoulder, to thrash Leicester City 4-0 on Boxing Day 2019. This was a team playing with a kind of light around them.     Liverpool at their peak: James Milner is congratulated after scoring at Leicester in the swaggering 4-0 win at Leicester on Boxing Day 2019. Photograph: PA Wire/PA    The real stutters and stumbles arrived just after Christmas this season. Injuries were the catalyst. The real issue is the lack of cover, those fine margins again. Liverpool began the season with three battle-hardened centre-backs, two of them prone to injury. Most teams at their level have four, or in Manchester City\u2019s case six. Even Arsenal have five. What happens when your own three are suddenly unavailable? This is where Klopp blinked, where he will draw criticism for dismantling his champion midfield to fix his defence. What could he have done differently? Klopp saw the future in the draws against West Brom and Newcastle, in the FA Cup defeat by Manchester United when Rhys Williams, a non-league footballer the year before, was traumatised by Marcus Rashford. He was right to be spooked. The truth was out. Liverpool\u2019s replacements are a very obvious step down. These are not players ready to chase the best in Europe. No planning, no succession had been laid down. Eight out of 10 starting outfield players in the 2018 Champions League final are still in Liverpool\u2019s best team now. With Henderson and Fabinho jiggled into the centre-back roles, with Diogo Jota injured \u2013 a rare high-grade reinforcement \u2013 there was nowhere to go, no room to wriggle. The bizarro world arrived at the start of February with the current run of six defeats in seven league games. Klopp may be keeping his counsel, bruised by events beyond football, a little sad and tender on his touchline, with the sense that someone has shaved Aslan\u2019s mane. But the peaks of the last two years are not diminished by this. The opposite, in fact. An unspoken truth about Klopp\u2019s title-winning Liverpool is that they don\u2019t contain many obviously great individuals. Only three players in the squad \u2013 Van Dijk, Salah and Alisson \u2013 possess the kind of gal\u00e1ctico chops that might make them standalone stars at one of Europe\u2019s mega-clubs. This is instead a feat of high-end coaching, shared commitment and a system perfectly geared to these parts. Very good footballers have been encouraged to reach out into the far limits of their talent. But the system also requires rest and reinforcement to sustain its levels. Neither of these came. Last season Van Dijk, Roberto Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold played in every league game. Georginio Wijnaldum played 37, Andrew Robertson 36, Sadio Man\u00e9 35, Salah 34. The entire first XI played at least 10 midweek games. The same happened the year before \u2013 and this in a team where the tempo is always superheated. Opponents found being on a pitch with those red shirts a horribly draining experience. Liverpool had to be Liverpool every week.     Despair for Naby Ke\u00efta and teammates as Liverpool lose to Fulham. A relatively callow squad have struggled this season. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Shutterstock    Signings have been made in moments of need. But the fact remains Liverpool have spent \u00a312m net in the past two seasons. Net spend on transfer fees \u2013 not wages and bonuses \u2013 in the last four years is \u00a360m. This is excellent business. But it isn\u2019t a recipe for resilience. In the long term you need more space to fail. Pep Guardiola has regeared his team brilliantly. He also has the resources to do this, because City spend around \u00a3100m net on new players every year, with the freedom to buy the ones you want, not just the ones you need because the red light that says panic is flashing.     The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.   And so we have this, a fine-margins project that reached a rare pitch because of the brilliance of the system, the first XI, the shared energy from the stands. But which has, in the past 14 league games, found its own edges. This can hardly come as shock to Liverpool\u2019s owners, or indeed to Klopp. The refusal to gorge in the good times, to splurge on Timo Werner, is not neglect or poor husbandry. This is hard-nosed financial management. Assets will be sweated. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. There will be no waste, no sop to chasing glory. If the team burn themselves out while creating one glorious, low-cost brand-burnishing mini-era, well, so be it. Plus, of course, that first XI is still on site. There was a glimpse of that power with Fabinho returned to midfield against RB Leipzig in midweek. The pieces could quite easily fall into their slots once again, the tempo resurrect itself, the habit of winning replace the habit of losing. But there can be no illusions now over what Klopp achieved with that high-functioning, high-wire group of fellow travellers; or what will be required to build it again.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "HuffPost UK staff face redundancy as national news operation closes down", "full_article": "BuzzFeed has told the UK staff of its recently acquired HuffPost website that it is shutting down its national news operation, leaving more than half its editorial staff at risk of redundancy and confirming the end of a digital journalism era. After the BuzzFeed chief executive, Jonah Peretti, told staff that 47 HuffPost employees were being made redundant immediately in the US, 16 of 29 full-time journalists at its London-based office received emails this week informing them that they also face losing their jobs. Of the existing news staff, only the site\u2019s separate politics team will be retained, while the video desk is also to be cut. It is understood that the editor-in-chief, Jess Brammar, is among those at risk. Every mother on the UK editorial staff has been told they face losing their job, including one person on maternity leave. Four jobs are available to the 16, 11 of whom are women. One member of staff said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they have deliberately targeted women and mothers \u2013 but it is striking that their decisions have played out this way and they don\u2019t seem to have even noticed.\u201d Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, a charity that campaigns to stop discrimination against pregnant women and mothers in the workplace, said HuffPost would be \u201closing valuable life experience, and this will have an impact on content\u201d.  BuzzFeed would not confirm numbers, saying it was constrained by the conditions of a consultation period, but acknowledged HuffPost would be going forward \u201cwith a smaller team, while exploring new commercial partnerships in the market\u201d. Some staff have been angered by the way the move has been handled, with complaints that communication \u2013 via an email from a California-based HR representative which came during a staff meeting about what Peretti\u2019s announcement would mean in the UK \u2013 had been \u201cthoughtless at best, callous at worst\u201d. Another staffer said: \u201cWe have had to add all [the numbers at risk] up ourselves because they haven\u2019t told anyone anything. The people staying have no idea when their editor is leaving or who they now report to.\u201d The password for the international meeting hosted by Peretti setting out the wider cost-cutting moves was \u201cspr!ngisH3r3\u201d, or \u201cspring is here\u201d. BuzzFeed subsequently said the company regretted the password\u2019s tone. BuzzFeed\u2019s acquisition of HuffPost last year came after Peretti announced drastic cuts to BuzzFeed\u2019s own highly respected US news division in 2019. It closed its UK and Australia news operations a year later, effectively signalling the end of its challenge to the traditional news media in both countries. The two brands had been at the forefront of the group of digital native startups competing with legacy news outlets and had once seemed likely to become permanent players. Those precedents led many at HuffPost UK to fear the worst when the deal was announced. \u201cBut I actually thought they would recognise that our news stuff is our strongest brand here,\u201d one at-risk staffer said. \u201cOur news coverage gets viewed most.\u201d While HuffPost \u2013 founded as the Huffington Post by Arianna Huffington in 2005 and swiftly becoming an early phenomenon of a social media-dominated news era \u2013 had a relatively small team in the UK, it has frequently punched above its weight, with particular strengths in coverage outside of London and on issues facing minority ethnic communities. This week, it published a data-driven story revealing that Met police press releases highlight a disproportionate number of violent crimes committed by black people. Brammar was the first editor of a major news site to publicly criticise the Society of Editors\u2019 controversial claim after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s interview with Oprah Winfrey that there was no racism in the British media. Other notable stories include a piece revealing how racists in Leicester were capitalising on the city\u2019s lockdown to spread misinformation about the city\u2019s minority ethnic communities and coverage of SPAC Nation, a London church that faced allegations of fraud and physical abuse of young people. BuzzFeed said in a statement: \u201cBuzzFeed has announced that it\u2019s begun a restructuring of HuffPost in order to break even this year and fast-track its path to profitability. As part of these changes, we have begun a consultation process in the UK to propose focusing on local coverage of politics, entertainment and Life (HuffPost\u2019s lifestyle vertical) with a smaller team, while exploring new commercial partnerships in the market.\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Massive drop in UK trade shows extent of Boris Johnson's Brexit own goal", "full_article": "While most UK consumers found a way to weather the third lockdown, manufacturers were not so lucky after the government\u2019s last-minute deal with the EU plunged British ports into chaos and sent trade plummeting by 40%. Without a smooth route across the Channel, the manufacturing sector was always going to struggle. That trade dropped by the most in more than 20 years illustrates how dependent on trade the UK is and has always been. As an act of self-sabotage, Boris Johnson\u2019s willingness to negotiate the thinnest of Brexit deals was always going to rank alongside the major economic debacles of the past century. Up and down the country, businesses report edging towards the brink of collapse as hold-ups at the border prevent their goods making it to customers in the EU.   Related: UK forced to delay checks on imports from EU by six months    Manufacturers, many of which are basically assembly points for components sourced from across the world, have struggled to keep production lines moving. The Office for National Statistics said manufacturing output contracted by 2.3% month on month in January, with output falling in nine out of 13 subsectors. Worst affected was the car industry, which has already taken a battering over the past year and been denied almost any meaningful investment for four years while the mostly foreign-owned industry waited to see what life outside the EU would be like. Agriculture and fishing fared even worse, suffering huge falls in exports. The 60% slump in food and live animal exports is a startling figure, especially when the UK is so reliant on food as a source of income. It is, after all, the largest segment of the manufacturing industry, dwarfing cars, aerospace and telecoms. The government will rely on the more buoyant services sector to show the UK is doing better than expected after a year of Covid. There was a consensus among City economists polled by Reuters that GDP growth would fall by 4.9% in January but it slid by only 2.9% after consumer spending proved more resilient than in previous lockdowns. Next week the Bank of England will probably react by upgrading its forecast for growth for 2021, citing the smaller dip in activity during January as a signal of a shallower fall in first-quarter GDP.   UK exports fell 40% in January   Ministers will also argue that the trade figures were skewed by firms stockpiling in November and December in anticipation of a much-feared no-deal Brexit. That trend no doubt accounts for some of the fall in January. However, looking out over longer time horizons, a 16.7% slump in exports in 2020 is likely to be offset by not much more than a 7% rise 2021. With many economists forecasting imports will rise at an even faster rate than exports as the economy is released from lockdown restrictions, the trade balance will deteriorate yet again. Overall, it is clear the impact of Brexit will be felt for years to come in the trade sector.

Photograph: Michael Probst/AP    Seven months before the chancellor\u2019s 16-year stint comes to an end with federal elections on 26 September, state votes in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate could teach the German public a surprising lesson: that they can vote for a continuation of Merkelism not just without Merkel, but also without the CDU. Since winning the leadership mandate in Germany\u2019s top export state in 2011, Kretschmann has pursued an ambitious agenda on biodiversity while keeping local carmakers on side with the kind of pragmatic approach usually associated with the country\u2019s famously consensual chancellor. As journalist Ulrich Schulte puts it in a new book on the ecological party, Kretschmann\u2019s south-western Greens have managed to become what the CDU once used to be and what the national Green party dreams of becoming: \u201can indispensable political force that represents and shapes the state like no other\u201d. While the latest polls in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg give the Green party a 10-point lead, his Christian Democrat coalition partners could on Sunday not just face a historic defeat in their former stronghold, but also the possibility of being pushed out of office in favour of a \u201ctraffic-light coalition\u201d between the Greens, the Social Democratic party (SPD) and the pro-business Free Democrats.

Here too, the Christian Democrats could be left out in the cold as a result of their polling lead having disappeared in the wake of kickback allegations over mask procurement deals and a growing frustration with a sluggish vaccination rollout overseen by CDU ministers.   Related: Corruption claims threaten to damage Germany's CDU party    For leader Armin Laschet, who has led the conservative outfit for less than two months but hopes to take Merkel\u2019s mantle in September, the two state elections could provide a sobering reality check. \u201cThe danger for Laschet is that his leadership qualities will come into question before he has fully settled in his job\u201d, said Thorsten Faas, a political scientist at Berlin\u2019s Free University. \u201cAfter the votes on Sunday there will be strategic attempts to blame the mask affair and weak candidates\u201d, Faas said. \u201cBut one thing is quite clear: the government\u2019s ratings, and especially those of the CDU, only shot up because of the pandemic \u2013 and now they are going down again\u201d. How low the hegemon of German postwar politics can fall remains the great unknown. Recent polls still show the CDU as the strongest force in the country, at roughly the same share of the vote it received in 2017. And whether the second-placed Green party under leadership duo Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck can simply take its place on the national stage by copying their success story in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is questionable.

Kretschmann\u2019s consensual approach has involved compromises that have made the more leftwing quarters of his party wince, such as a proposal for a scrappage scheme to incentivise the purchase of new diesel and petrol cars, designed to support automobile companies struggling during the pandemic. It has also created space for the foundation of a small new ecological party, Klimaliste Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which will compete for Green seats at Sunday\u2019s vote. Signalling too much of Kretschmann\u2019s flexibility in the run-up to the September vote, some Green supporters fear, could damage the party\u2019s standing just as they limber up to play a role in the next government. They point a warning finger at Austria, where the Greens entered a power-sharing deal with chancellor Sebastian Kurz\u2019s conservatives in 2020 but have been outmuscled in a symbolic battle over the country\u2019s asylum policy.

Algorithms would ease congestion on heated roads. Autonomous vehicles would shuttle residents past towering wooden skyscrapers. And by closely studying millions of residents, computers could learn how to make the city more livable. Sidewalk Labs pledged to make Toronto one of the world\u2019s first \u201csmart\u201d cities.

In announcing its new vision this week for Quayside, Toronto has backed away from many of the previous plan\u2019s most futuristic promises, a move experts say reflects growing skepticism over technology\u2019s role in urban planning decisions. \u201cQuayside will usher in a new chapter in Toronto development. It will remind people of everything they want from living in the city and demonstrate what is possible when vision, passion and design excellence are brought together,\u201d Waterfront Toronto said in a statement. The call for new development proposals comes nearly a year after the city and Google-affiliated Sidewalk Labs parted ways \u2013 a stinging defeat for a project championed by the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and Eric Schmidt of Google, who had promised a community built \u201cfrom the internet up\u201d. Before the partnership was called off, the project had come under sharp criticism, amid questions over privacy and fears of \u201csurveillance capitalism\u201d. \u201cThe initial plans were definitely scary for a lot of people \u2026 it felt like [Quayside] was going to become a technology-based gated community, where everything was monitored behaviour, personal data is collected by thousands of cameras,\u201d said Jasmine Mohamed, a Toronto resident completing her graduate degree in urban planning. \u201cI\u2019m glad that\u2019s no longer a priority for the new vision.\u201d Instead, the new plan centres on affordability, low-carbon design and an emphasis on local and minority-owned businesses. While it retains a number of elements from the initial glossy renderings \u2013 such as wooden skyscrapers \u2013 the new plan focuses more on integrating elements of Lake Ontario into parks and recreational amenities. For a city already grappling with a housing shortage and affordability crisis, the plans need to be ambitious if Toronto hopes to achieve any degree of equity, warns Mohamed. \u201cThe pandemic has brought disparities in the city to the forefront. It\u2019s hit low-income areas so hard.

But the idea, she says, was premised both on the notion that weather systems that caused the worst damage could be predicted \u2013 and that the city wouldn\u2019t lose power during a severe storm.

The next day, I told him I\u2019d changed my mind. We\u2019ve been ridiculously happily married for 27 years. Rebecca Hough, teacher, Italy Have a glass of water My mum has had lots of advice for her children over the years, but whenever we\u2019re ill, stressed, tired or panicking (sometimes all of the above), she tells us to \u201chave a glass of water\u201d. It fixes everything \u2013 or at least gives you a minute to pause and collect yourself. Sometimes, it can feel like the least useful advice at that moment, but it works. These days, it\u2019s become a family joke, but we\u2019ve all found ourselves at some point telling friends or partners to \u201chave a glass of water\u201d. Mum knows best!

Get up, walk, do some gardening, vacuum or play golf and then you feel like doing more. Graham McKenzie, publisher, West Sussex Eat breakfast When camping, my mum always taught me to make sure everyone gets a proper breakfast. She also advised me to save a little bit of money each month that you can cash in from time to time, whenever you need to.

She said that when children come out of school, they want to talk about what\u2019s happened there and then \u2013 if you wait to get home after a day\u2019s work then children tend to have forgotten any small niggles or concerns they had. I actually listened to her on this occasion, so my husband, my mum and my sister worked around various jobs to make sure one of us could always meet the children after school.

However, the one that sticks with me is: \u201cAn ounce of practicality is better than a pound of pity.\u201d My mum was an intensely practical Irish woman so, because of her, I have sent a practical gift each month to friends, to cheer them up during the pandemic: hand-knitted socks for friends getting chemo, food parcels with treats for friends on furlough or those who were made redundant, chocolate for one friend who was feeling down and a craft class to distract another friend. It doesn\u2019t need to be a grand gesture, just something that says you care, and you have thought about what they really need. Ros Coffey, executive assistant, London Don\u2019t follow the crowd My mum advised me against learning the flute or the clarinet \u2013 \u201ceveryone plays them\u201d \u2013 so, as a child I learned to play the oboe and, once I had grown bigger, the bassoon. The choice led to so many opportunities: I was competing against far fewer people for orchestral places and, in time, I won a place at the Royal College of Music Junior Department and then the National Youth Orchestra (where there were 13 bassoonists competing for eight places rather than 300-plus clarinettists). I travelled to many countries and developed a deep knowledge and love of music which has enriched my life immeasurably. My mum died three years ago, and I miss her wisdom. It was never just about which instrument to play; at the heart of her advice was the message \u201cdon\u2019t do what everyone else does\u201d. It\u2019s the best advice anyone ever gave me. Katy Astley, fundraiser, Cambridgeshire \u2018Will it matter tomorrow?\u2019 Growing up, when I was worried about something, my mum would ask me: \u201cWill it matter tomorrow? Will it matter next week? Next month? Next year?\u201d It was and still is a good way to put life\u2019s turmoil into perspective. It doesn\u2019t prevent worrying, but it does make me realise how pointless it often is. Cabi Grosvenor, teacher, Bath     Sarah Luty\u2019s youngest son and her mum just before her 90th birthday.

In 2019, he presented a documentary for Channel 4 on empire, looking at the Amritsar massacre, and got \u201chundreds, if not thousands of messages and letters and complaints about that. So I got a small taste of it then. I knew it would be insane. But it\u2019s escalated. It\u2019s been vicious.\u201d Sanghera has shared some of the messages and letters he has received on his Twitter account, describing the abuse as \u201cproof we need to have this conversation\u201d. The attacks, he says, are a fraction of those directed at David Olusoga, the historian and broadcaster whose last book Black and British examined the relationship between the British Isles and the people of Africa and the Caribbean.

You\u2019re talking about white people conquering brown people. And so when you have brown people like David or me talking about empire, it triggers people in a really deep way. David challenges the hierarchy of empire. But he also challenges the way the imperial story has always been told, which is a 50-year-old white man on TV, often getting off a train in India; a nostalgic view. Suddenly there\u2019s brown people taking ownership of this story and it\u2019s really triggering for so many people.\u201d By contrast, William Dalrymple, a historian who writes on similar topics to Sanghera and Olusoga in his books and has been scathing about Britain\u2019s \u201cvast ignorance of everything that is most uncomfortable about our imperial past\u201d, says he has not received a single piece of hate mail from a British person.

We need answers | Fiona Lowenstein", "full_article": "Since the earliest days of the pandemic, members of disability and chronic illness communities have warned that Covid-19 could be a mass-disabling event. Yet media stories and policy decisions have continued to focus on hospitalizations and deaths, largely ignoring \u201clong Covid\u201d \u2013 the patient-preferred term for the long-term symptoms that some patients have experienced following what can begin as a mild Covid infection. Pharmaceutical companies, health agencies and governments are confident that vaccines can decrease hospitalization and death rates, eventually ending the pandemic. But few are discussing long Covid within the context of vaccines or the pandemic\u2019s resolution. Those of us who have experienced the long-term symptoms of Covid-19 find ourselves erased from the narrative once again, and wondering: can the vaccine prevent long Covid, and to what extent?   Related: People with long Covid urgently need help. Why can't we access it? | Joanna Herman    Discussions of Covid vaccine efficacy have focused on the vaccine\u2019s ability to prevent severe illness, death and hospitalization. On 24 February, the New York Times reported that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine \u201cstrongly protects against severe illness\u201d. Earlier this week, the Times\u2019 David Leonhardt wrote of J&amp;J\u2019s vaccine: \u201cThe picture is murkier for mild cases, but they are not particularly worrisome.\u201d (Full disclosure: I have done work as a video producer for a Covid news show produced by Johnson &amp; Johnson.) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website states that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appears to protect against \u201cmore serious outcomes\u201d such as hospitalization or death. In a recent New York Times op-ed, the Georgetown University virologist Dr Angela Rasmussen explains that the purpose of the vaccines \u201cis to prevent death and serious health complications that strain our overburdened healthcare system. This is undeniably good news, but it does not account for long-term outcomes from asymptomatic or mild infections. A recent study from the University of Washington found that 30% of Covid patients surveyed still had persistent symptoms at nine months. The study is unique in that a majority of the patients surveyed (84.7%) \u201cwere outpatients with mild illness\u201d as compared with past studies that have focused only on hospitalized patients. \u201cOur research indicates that the health consequences of Covid-19 extend far beyond acute infection, even among those who experience mild illness,\u201d the University of Washington researchers write. Paola Garcia, 39, in New York, told me that her initial Covid symptoms mimicked those of a mild cold or flu; she dealt with a low fever, fatigue and mild shortness of breath, among other initially manageable issues. But those symptoms never went away. Garcia got sick on 20 March last year, and in addition to the symptoms she experienced at first, she has developed more serious symptoms, such as tremors, pericarditis, temperature dysregulation, hair loss, weight loss, nausea, fatigue and cognitive functioning issues. Garcia is one of many long Covid patients who recall the early days of their virus as initially mild. Donn Seidholz, 67, in Omaha, told me that he tested positive for Covid-19 on 12 August after experiencing migraines, fatigue, brain fog, loss of taste and smell, and a racing heart. Seven months later, he still has not regained his sense of smell or taste, says his brain fog has become \u201cdebilitating\u201d and reports ongoing and intermittent fatigue. Seidholz\u2019s experience is common to many long Covid patients, and in some cases, mild symptoms can even lead to death. Given the lasting potential impact of a mild Covid infection, the conversation around vaccine efficacy must consider whether the vaccine can prevent mild disease and infection. That being said, when trying to determine the prevalence of long Covid among non-severe cases, it is important to distinguish between non-hospitalized or \u201coutpatient\u201d cases and patients with initially \u201cmild\u201d symptoms. While some Covid patients weren\u2019t hospitalized because their symptoms were mild, others were turned away due to overwhelmed healthcare systems, medical bias, or both.    We cannot ignore the potential long-term impact of mild Covid cases    \u201cMy symptoms were not mild,\u201d says Leigh W Jerome, who sought care for Covid in New York in March and was sent home without a PCR test or medication. \u201cI was told that in normal times I would be admitted, but these were not normal times.\u201d She went on to develop bilateral pneumonia the following week, but remained untreated until September, when she began connecting with clinicians who had been recommended by other long Covid patients in the support group I run. Because long Covid is new and widespread awareness is still limited, it\u2019s unsurprising that discussions about vaccine efficacy and the pandemic\u2019s resolution are failing to consider long-term illness and disability. But there are scientific and historical precedents for the idea that viruses can have long-term effects, and in some past disease outbreaks, these outcomes have been considered more seriously. During the race to the polio vaccine in 1954, disability was front and center in conversations about ending the outbreak. \u201cThere was a lot of demand for the vaccine from parents who were concerned that their children would get polio and be paralyzed,\u201d explains Dr Ren\u00e9 Najera, an associate in the epidemiology department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who runs the History of Vaccines project at the College of Physicians in Philadelphia. Polio disables less than 1% of the population it infects, but Dr Najera says that the virus\u2019s impact on children \u2013 coupled with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s well-known polio disability \u2013 caused widespread public concern. The scientists developing the vaccine understood these fears, and the vaccine\u2019s efficacy was measured by looking at severe polio cases in children and determining whether the patient in question had been vaccinated for the virus before being infected. \u201cThere was no lab test for polio per se,\u201d Dr Najera told me. Unlike Covid-19, polio patients rarely received a diagnosis before experiencing severe symptoms and paralyzation. \u201cThey were not catching the asymptomatic, the less sick,\u201d Dr Najera said of the early polio vaccine trials. The Sars-Cov-2 virus poses a slightly trickier conundrum, since Covid cases that are initially diagnosed as mild can still have long-term or disabling effects. Long Covid also appears to be more common than polio paralysis. The University of Washington estimate of 30% has been cited by the National Institutes of Health, but rates may be even higher since there have been no attempts to estimate long Covid prevalence beyond individual studies. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a while before we see completely the picture of Covid in the population,\u201d says Dr Najera. Because no governments are tracking long Covid along with rates of infections, death and hospitalization, it will be hard to measure how much these numbers decrease after more people are vaccinated. That being said, emerging research from Israel indicates that Covid vaccines could prevent both infection and disease, which scientists refer to as \u201csterilizing immunity\u201d. If vaccines can prevent infection, they can prevent mild cases and thus long Covid. Unfortunately, the Israeli findings are still new, and it is important to note that while infection rates in Israel have declined since vaccination began, infection rates there are still higher than they were in November, and scientists disagree on whether Israel can provide evidence of the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness against new Covid variants.   Related: Biden signs $1.9tn Covid relief ahead of first primetime address as president    The polio vaccine was hugely effective at preventing disability, death and eventually eradicating the virus from most of the world. (Polio still exists in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan, due in part to CIA actions that caused vaccine hesitancy among local populations), and the Covid vaccines will have an undeniable impact on our current pandemic, regardless of whether they provide sterilizing immunity. If the vaccines can provide sterilizing immunity, we may be looking at our last wave of long Covid patients. In the meantime, we cannot ignore the potential long-term impact of mild Covid cases. We need more research into whether the vaccine can prevent mild disease and infection entirely; until then, public health guidelines must consider mild infections as a potential threat to society and the economy. A study from the Patient-Led Research Collaborative that surveyed almost 4,000 long Covid patients who became sick in the first waves of the pandemic, found that most still have not been able to make a full return to work, and many are struggling to access necessary disability benefits. Just as clinicians and employers should not write off patients with initially mild cases who report debilitating long-term symptoms, the media and policymakers should not write off mild cases as having no effect on society or human health. Furthermore, we must consider long Covid in the vaccine rollout and in discussions about the pandemic\u2019s end. Early anecdotes from long Covid patients who have received the vaccine demonstrate that responses may be varied, with some patients reporting an alleviation of symptoms and others experiencing more intense side-effects. These reactions need to be studied, understood, and recommendations about the vaccine need to take long Covid patients into account.

The group has come together to help others honour the life of the 33-year-old, whose body was confirmed to have been found on 12 March, and push for societal and political change to tackle widespread violence against women and girls in the UK.\n    The group has formed five asks to achieve this aim:\n    Value women: Under new legislation going through parliament, a person can get 10 years in prison if they deface or bring down a statue. Statues are offered more protection than women. Women have a right to live without fear. Their safety must be prioritised. \n    Overhaul the criminal justice system: Only 1.4% of rapes recorded by police in England and Wales result in a charge or a summons. Violent sexual offenders must be held to account and victims put at the heart of the process. Only one in 7 victims of rape believe they will get justice reporting to the police. Victims' experience should shape our criminal justice system \u2013 they need to be consulted at every stage on how we can make changes to ensure justice. The government should consult with victims as part of its ongoing Rape Review, which it has as yet failed to do.\n    Count dead women: We count what we care about. And we can\u2019t tackle something until we understand it. The government needs to&nbsp; centrally collect data on women killed by men, including demographic and social factors.\n    Education on consent and boundaries: We must teach boys and men, from childhood, about consent and boundaries. We must focus on men\u2019s actions and behaviours.

It was just after Christmas got cancelled, shortly before lockdown 3.0. I\u2019d bought tickets for the family to visit Glow Wild, a winter lantern trail on the Wakehurst estate in Sussex. In line with the season of disappointments, I had been fully expecting an email telling me that it would not be going ahead, but somehow \u2013 because it was an outdoor, socially distanced event \u2013 it opened as planned. On an ordinary year, this would have been one in a whole array of Christmas outings, to the panto, to grownup theatre, exhibitions, maybe a gig. But this year it was the only one, and as a result the lanterns we saw that evening glow brightly in my memory. The trail is put together every year by the local community arts group Same Sky, and involves thousands of paper lights hung from the trees, light and sound installations, and projections on to the walls of the stately home. We made our way past illuminated bumblebees and butterflies, past a lake dotted with dozens of flaming lanterns. After weeks of seeing very little but the inside of our house, it felt almost impossibly bright and colourful. When we reached a magical glade hung with giant, sparkling thistledown, my eight-year-old tugged on my hand. \u201cArtists are so clever,\u201d he said, his eyes like saucers. I would like to bottle that moment and send it to every artist who has spent the last year feeling completely useless. This has been such a demoralising time for the whole cultural sector, and the impact is not just financial. It has felt existential: what are the arts actually for? Are they really just a bit of trivial fun around the edges of life? When the chips are down, can we just get by without them? At a time when the whole of society is \u2013 quite rightly \u2013 aware of the contribution of health and social care staff, teachers, delivery drivers and supermarket staff, there hasn\u2019t been a role in this crisis for those who work in the arts. (Remember that awful government advert about Fatima, the ballet dancer whose next job was in cyber?) Of course nobody has the right to earn a living making art; and of course, artists have always had to do other jobs. But there is a special kind of despondency in finding that, at a critical moment, your long-honed skills just aren\u2019t required. In a recent article about musicians who have become delivery drivers, a common sentiment was that it wasn\u2019t merely a financial decision, but also a deep human need to feel useful, to make a contribution. In one recent survey, a third of musicians said they were considering giving up their careers as a result of the pandemic. My friend Joe Buirski, a folk music promoter whose festival has been cancelled two years in a row, and who is currently working in construction, sums up the complex emotions involved when he tells me: \u201cThe last year has made me both question all my life choices, and also love and value what I do more than ever.\u201d It is a sentiment many artists surely share. The author Sarah Perry has written about her response to the pandemic being \u201cthat literature was useless and I\u2019d wasted my life in its pursuit\u201d. I recognised that one. Having completed my second novel last year, fulfilling a dream held since childhood, I spent several months convincing myself that I should retrain as a doctor. (NB: I don\u2019t even have a science A-level.) And yet, even as artists have been fantasising about more useful careers, haven\u2019t we all also had an object lesson in how much we need art? We\u2019ve had so little to elevate us beyond the boundaries of ourselves. Some friends and I got bored of moaning about the pandemic, so we started a film club to give us something else to talk about. Sometimes exhaustion and home schooling have got in the way, but when I\u2019ve managed to watch the films, it has lifted my whole week. They have seemed to carry a new kind of emotional weight \u2013 Richard Linklater\u2019s Before trilogy, with its carefree, sun-kissed socialising and globetrotting, nearly undid me. Now, as we begin what will hopefully be a gradual return to a more rounded kind of life, is when art and artists will come into their own. The lightness, colour and feeling of wonder my son experienced at Glow Wild \u2013 that\u2019s what these last bleak months have been so sorely lacking. We are craving it as never before, just witness the festivals selling out as soon as they are announced. Turns out that a society stripped back to the \u201cbasics\u201d of food and healthcare is not one in which many of us want to live.

But three years later, the housing market crashed, neighborhood renewal stalled, and the home that was going to be a rental became her full-time residence. Owens fell into what she describes as a \u201cmajor depressive episode\u201d that would last for the better part of a decade.   Related: The life-altering effects heat is having on American children    That\u2019s when Owens, an IT developer for the state of Maryland, began to notice a pattern. During her workdays in the leafy suburbs of a nearby county, her mood would lift. \u201cEven though I was still dealing with stuff, I felt a sense of calm, of comfort,\u201d she remembers. On the commute back to the nearly treeless neighborhood she called home, that feeling would evaporate. \u201cThe closer I got to my house, the more depressed I would feel,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was just this overwhelming sense of heaviness.\u201d Owens\u2019s experience demonstrates the very real influence of tree inequity. In many cities, a map of urban tree cover reflects the geography of race and income, just as it does in Oliver, where 97% of residents are African American. This holds true across Baltimore, which still bears the scars of redlining, policies that denied mortgages and other financial services to entire communities of color. Black residents were essentially barred from purchasing homes in so-called greenlined neighborhoods, forced instead to choose among inner-city redlined areas.     A Baltimore neighborhood is lined with brick houses and trees. Photograph: Sergey Novikov/Alamy Stock Photo    Today, according to the US Forest Service, previously redlined areas have an average of 23% tree cover, while once-greenlined neighborhoods, living up to their old label, have an average of 43% tree cover. When Owens moved to Oliver, only about 10% of the neighborhood was tree-covered, according to Justin Bowers, associate director of the Baltimore Tree Trust, an organization that works to restore the city\u2019s urban canopy. In a dense neighborhood without lawns, this meant a stark lack of green space.   series links   The adverse effects of treeless neighborhoods are well-known and many. Bowers says that summer days in East Baltimore neighborhoods can be four to 16 degrees hotter than other parts of the city. In addition to heat-related illnesses, residents who lack tree cover consume more energy to stay cool, endure poorer air quality and \u2013 like Owens \u2013 report diminished mental health, he explains. Trees have long been suspected to have a positive effect on city-dwellers\u2019 overall happiness. But for many years, the correlation between urban trees and mental health remained difficult to prove. Researchers in Germany have now provided concrete evidence of the link between trees and mental health, by studying the correlation between prescription antidepressants and tree cover across a range of neighborhoods. This allowed researchers to avoid the shortcomings of previous studies, which have taken various approaches to the question of: how do you define and measure mental health? Even if a group of scientists chose to zoom in on a single mental illness, such as depression, there are still \u201ca variety of self-reported questionnaires one can use to measure it\u201d, says Melissa Marselle, an environmental psychologist and lecturer at De Montfort University who led the Germany study. \u201cThis made comparing the results [across studies] difficult, as each questionnaire may be measuring depression differently.\u201d     Kwamel Couther, foreman for Baltimore Tree Trust, unloads wheel barrows outside a school in East Baltimore. Photograph: Baltimore Tree Trust    Past studies also failed to determine how close a tree needs to be to someone\u2019s home to make a difference. Does simply looking out the window and seeing foliage have the same effect on mental health as visiting a city park? No one could say for sure. To isolate the relationship between everyday green space and mental health, Marselle and a team of interdisciplinary researchers from the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research and Leipzig University designed a study to figure out how the number, type and proximity of trees correlated to the number of antidepressants prescribed in a given neighborhood. The researchers analyzed data collected from 10,000 Leipzig residents during the University of Leipzig\u2019s Life-Adult Health Study, an exhaustive study that took place between 2011 and 2014 in which participants reported a wide array of health metrics, including their prescriptions. By combining that data with the number and species of street trees throughout the city, researchers were able to demonstrate in more material terms than ever before the correlation between trees and mental wellness. They found that, regardless of species, more trees within 100 meters from the home was associated with a reduced risk of antidepressant use. \u201cThis everyday contact with nearby nature \u2013 either through a window view at the home or on the street \u2013 has been shown to be beneficial for mental health and wellbeing,\u201d the researchers reported. The association was especially pronounced in residents with low socioeconomic status. \u201cThis is important because those from social deprived groups are most likely to be prescribed antidepressants,\u201d says Marselle. Though the study has several limitations (some individuals with depression are not prescribed medication as part of their treatment; some don\u2019t have access to treatment at all), it can serve as an important directive to urban planners. \u201cWhile planning, guidance for urban green space is mostly based on intentional, purposeful visits for recreation,\u201d the researchers wrote, \u201cwe suggest that such \u2018unintentional\u2019 everyday contact may reach more people and that such easily accessible urban green space can contribute to public health.\u201d This study comes on the heels of another that found that during Covid-19 lockdowns, people who could see trees and greenery outside their window reported lower rates of anxiety and depression, further demonstrating the importance of trees near the home.

Related: Surge in migrants seeking to cross Mexico border poses challenge for Biden    On Biden\u2019s first day in office, the president began reversing the policies of Donald Trump, who sought to reduce all forms of migration. But more is needed to respond to the increase in unaccompanied children at the border \u2013 9,457 of whom were taken into US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) custody in February, the most since May 2019. This is what we know so far: Why is there an increase in children at the border? The issues driving families and children to the border in the past decade remain: the climate crisis, violence, unemployment and poverty. Two devastating hurricanes in Honduras in November and the coronavirus pandemic have added to the desperate conditions. And each year migration increases when the weather warms up. All of this is colliding with a change in the US approach to migration. For four years, Donald Trump introduced policies that made it much more difficult to migrate to the US and essentially brought asylum to a halt last year \u2013 but people kept coming. Biden has revoked some Trump-era asylum measures and children who were being turned away two months ago are now being processed because Biden stopped a rule known as Title 42 from being applied to children. Florence Chamberlin, managing attorney for the advocacy group Kids in Need of Defense, told the Guardian last week from Mexico: \u201cTitle 42 and other policies of the previous administration have created an artificial back-up at the border of these children that has compounded the danger and trauma that they fled.\u201d It is also believed that at least some of the unaccompanied children initially approached the border with parents or other family members and were turned away, leading some families to send their children alone to improve their chances of entering the US. The border patrol also separates many children who are with non-parents, even when those adults may be the child\u2019s primary guardian. What happens to children after they seek asylum? For children seeking asylum on their own, the first step is to contact a border patrol official either at a legal port of entry or while trying to cross the border outside those checkpoints. Those unaccompanied children are supposed to be moved within three days out of border patrol custody to the health department\u2019s office of refugee resettlement\u2019s (ORR) network of shelters. From there, they are placed with a sponsor, usually a family member or friend already living in the US while their legal cases play out. Child welfare experts say it is essential children are moved to a sponsor as quickly as possible - but it is not happening very efficiently. As of Monday, nearly 1,400 children had been in border patrol custody for more than three days, according to CBS News. In a call with reporters on Wednesday, CBP officials would not provide information on how many children were in its custody and concerns are growing about the number of children detained in border patrol facilities. Troy Miller, the acting CBP commissioner, said: \u201cWe\u2019re doing everything that is possible to move the children out of our custody as quickly as we should, in a safe and healthy manner.\u201d Why are children still being detained? Precisely because the process of getting children to sponsors is not moving quickly enough. The Biden administration has taken steps to improve its efficiency, and other changes are rumored to be on the way, but it is also inheriting the changes Trump made to shrink asylum and refugee processing. Leah Chavla, a senior policy adviser at the Women\u2019s Refugee Commission, said: \u201cWhat we saw under the last administration was, yes, there were times when there were a lot of unaccompanied children in government custody and those were really due to policies that were cruel and awful and on purpose. It wasn\u2019t because the system couldn\u2019t process the children.\u201d What is Biden doing about this? ORR shelters usually have capacity for 13,600 children, but this was reduced by 40% because of the pandemic. This week, Biden opened the shelters to full capacity. The administration has also introduced several measures to streamline the sponsor process, including improving information sharing between the many agencies involved and allowing shelter operators to pay for transportation of undocumented children if their sponsors couldn\u2019t \u2013 which previously only happened with special approval. Biden on Wednesday resurrected a program shuttered by Trump that allows children to apply for asylum from their home countries, instead of making the dangerous journey north. And it is expected that the Biden administration will act on a long-held request by advocates to send health department officials to work with the border patrol, which could expedite matching children with sponsors. Perhaps the most controversial change has been Biden\u2019s decision to reopen the remote Carrizo Springs influx facility in Texas for children aged 13 to 17. The administration is also considering opening additional influx shelters in California and Virginia. Why is the influx shelter controversial? Influx facilities are meant to be temporary and are not subject to the same licensing as permanent shelters. The news about Carrizo Springs prompted criticism of the administration returning to \u201ckids in cages\u201d, from prominent figures on the left and right. But many advocates have said despite their serious concerns these shelters are preferable to the alternative available today: keeping children at a border patrol facility while sponsors are vetted. What happens next? Independent advocates are monitoring what happens at the shelters, how long children are being kept at border patrol stations and how quickly children are safely placed with sponsors. There were 8,100 children in ORR custody as of Monday. A group of senior administration officials visited the border over the weekend and briefed Biden about their findings on Wednesday. Crucially, the border is still mostly closed to asylum seekers. Unaccompanied children are being allowed in, but most single adults are not. Some families and people in the Remain in Mexico program have also been admitted since Biden took office.

The county produces about 70% of the state\u2019s oil and more than 90% of its natural gas \u2013 and it has plans to ramp up production. This week the county approved an ordinance that would allow thousands of new wells to be drilled over the next 15 years. The decision comes despite deep opposition from local farmers and environmental groups, and it puts the county directly at odds with a state that has branded itself as a trailblazer on climate and set ambitious goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In doing so, Kern has become a microcosm of a debate happening across America \u2013 and around the world \u2013 about how to tackle the climate crisis in communities that are built on fossil fuels. \u201cKern county runs on oil,\u201d as the county chairman, Phillip Peters, concisely puts it. The debate has been going on for years, according to Ethan Elkind, a director at the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment at University of California, Berkeley, School of Law. \u201cWhat you are seeing here is the main oil and gas producing county in California is going one direction and the state is trying to go a different direction,\u201d he explains, \u201cand it\u2019s so far unwilling to override the county on the issue of local oil and gas production.\u201d It\u2019s a complicated problem. Kern is also a leader in renewable energy production, accounting for roughly 25% of California\u2019s supply, but officials argue there is not yet enough revenue from the new industries. For Kern, a county where nearly 20% live below the poverty line, expanding oil production means expanding the budget. \u201cThis is a fiscal imbalance that has to be resolved before you start talking about a just transition,\u201d said Lorelei Oviatt, the director of the Kern county planning and natural resources department, during Monday\u2019s vote to approve the new ordinance. \u201cWe are looking at the difference between $1.5m a year and $80m a year. Until that is resolved, the idea of banning fossil fuel extraction does not seem realistic.\u201d Roughly one in seven workers in Kern are employed by the industry or tied to it. A county analysis done last year found that the oil and gas industry funded the county to the tune of almost $200m a year. Roughly half of that, $103m, went to Kern county schools.

Photograph: Jae C Hong/AP    Health and environmental concerns The question over Kern county\u2019s future came to a head on Monday at a community meeting before the county\u2019s vote on the new drilling plans. Hundreds of people from the community and across California called in to speak. Mike Maggard, a county supervisor, called it the \u201clongest public hearing on a single issue\u201d he had seen in his long career. Farmers voiced concerns about how the land, water, and air would be affected, while justice advocates highlighted how increased pollution would take the harshest toll on the most vulnerable. Others shared their stories about how the oil industry had given them job opportunities that changed their lives. After a meeting that stretched across nearly 11 hours, it took the county board of supervisors minutes to vote unanimously to approve the new ordinance. The ordinance, a scaled-back version of one that originally passed in 2015 but was struck down after an environmental review, will allow for roughly 40,000 wells to be permitted through 2034. It also requires producers to take steps to soften their impact on the environment, including paying into funds to help mitigate some of the negative impacts.     The South Belridge oilfield in Kern county is the fourth-largest oil field in California and one of the most productive in the US. Photograph: David McNew/Getty Images    An environmental impact assessment conducted by the county found many problems could not be avoided, including more issues with air and water quality and increases in greenhouse gas emissions. The new projects will also put greater strain on the groundwater supply in an agricultural region that already struggles with drought, and where many lack access to clean drinking water. But there is a trove of recoverable reserves still left in the ground, according to reports from the US Energy Information Administration, including approximately 2bn barrels of oil and 1.5tn cubic feet of natural gas, and Kern county officials favor developing what is under their feet for as long as they can. The cash comes with a high cost. Each year, the American Lung Association ranks cities in the region among the worst in the US for air quality and gives the county an F rating for both ozone and particle pollution. More than 30% of kids under 17 are diagnosed with asthma in Kern, more than double the rate across the state. Dozens of peer-reviewed studies done in high oil-producing areas across the country have found that living close to a drilling site correlated with high rates of cancer and respiratory and cardiovascular disease. And close to 60% of those living within a mile of the current oil and gas wells are people of color, according to a 2014 report from the National Resources Defense Council. Juan Flores, a community organizer for the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment, has called the decision \u201cinexcusable and shameful\u201d. \u201cThe board of supervisors\u2019 vote to pass this ordinance shows they are willing to turn a blind eye to the chronic health problems, disastrous environmental impacts, and disruptions to already disadvantaged communities of color that adding tens of thousands of new wells would create,\u201d Flores said in a statement, vowing to keep fighting.     Fields of carrots are watered in Kern county. Farmers have raised concerns about the effects of new drilling on the water and air. Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty Images    Mercedes Macias, a senior organizer with the Sierra Club who lives and works in Kern county, says advocates will begin pushing the state to crack down on the county. \u201cBy passing this ordinance, the board of supervisors has made clear that they are willing to turn their backs on our community in favor of propping up the oil industry \u2013 and it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that people could die as a result,\u201d she says, emphasizing that the environmental and health risks take a disproportionate toll on communities of color. Calls for state intervention On Wednesday, community and environmental groups filed a lawsuit against the ordinance in Kern county superior court, naming the county, the board of supervisors, the California Independent Petroleum Association and the Western States Petroleum Association and arguing that the environmental review conducted was inadequate. The groups also claim that the new ordinance will fast-track oil and gas projects and inhibit public participation and environmental assessments going into the future.  Meanwhile, advocates are staking their hopes in part on a state bill that would ban new permits for fracking and several other methods of oil recovery and set stricter standards on how close wells can be from schools and homes. If passed, the bill would also create a program for oil and gas workers who are displaced, but so far the plan is scant on details. California is facing the effects of the climate crisis on multiple fronts \u2013 from drought to coastal erosion to record-setting wildfires. Meanwhile, the state has set some of the country\u2019s most ambitious goals to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, including a 40% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2030.   Related: 'California and Texas are warnings': blackouts show US deeply unprepared for the climate crisis    But state auditors have said that, at the current rate of reductions, California is not on track to hit its target. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has been outspoken on the issue but hesitant to intervene at the county level, or offer a clear plan for how to transition communities that are financially dependent on oil and gas. Most of the state\u2019s focus, though, has been on reducing transportation emissions and the demand for fossil fuels, which has increased since 2013. The state\u2019s housing crisis has pushed people to live farther from city centers, increasing commute times, and the market for quick deliveries and app-based rides has put more cars and trucks on the roads.     Gavin Newsom tours the Chevron oil field west of Bakersfield. Some are calling for the state to take a more interventionist approach to new development. Photograph: Irfan Khan/AP    Last year, in an attempt to reign in growing emissions from transportation, Newsom issued an executive order requiring all new passenger vehicles sold in the state after 2035 to be zero-emission, calling it the \u201cmost impactful step our state can take to fight climate change\u201d. Melissa Hurtado, a state senator whose district covers parts of Kern county, agrees that more needs to be done. \u201cOur climate change policies and goals have not been working; instead they have created inequities in our most vulnerable communities,\u201d she says. \u201cThe truth is climate change is here and we are in desperate need of a new vision on how to tackle the challenges of today, but also the challenges of tomorrow.\u201d Elkind, from the Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, says he would like to see the state plan for a more interventionist approach in places like Kern county. \u201cIf the state were really going to get serious about stopping oil and gas production, they would have to essentially step in and tell counties like Kern that we have to phase this out,\u201d Elkind says, adding that, so far, there have not been big attempts to get in the oil industry\u2019s way. \u201cWe need a managed, measured, multi-decade plan, with a clear signal that we are phasing things out,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe state should be the ones to say we are phasing it out in California and the state should be the ones to make sure the transition is done as equitably, humanely, and economically sustainable as possible.\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "The One review \u2013 algorithm-themed thriller is TV by numbers", "full_article": "There\u2019s something pleasingly spooky \u2013 or spookily pleasing \u2013 about watching a show on Netflix on the increasing power of algorithms to determine our lives.

It is a premise seen most recently in Amazon\u2019s six-part anthology series Soulmates, set in a near-future world in which computers run your DNA through a database to determine your, ah, soulmate, and Netflix\u2019s Gallic import Osmosis.

It\u2019s certainly a different choice, especially when you dispel much of the suspense by giving away too much information too early. Rebecca Webb (Hannah Ware, floundering with a script that cannot decide whether it wants her to be a magnificent virago or a vicious capitalist bitch) is a brilliant scientist and the ruthless CEO of the company behind the DNA-matching technology. She co-founded it with fellow brilliant scientist James (Dimitri Leonidas), but he walked away from the business \u2013 and a multi-kajillion dollar payday \u2013 for reasons unknown. Those reasons probably have something to do with the venture\u2019s shady origins, involving the hacking of a friend\u2019s work database, and that friend going missing a year ago. (Well, if he would go and work for a pharmaceutical company that just happened to have millions of DNA samples stored in its virtual vaults, what\u2019s a flatmate who\u2019s got a theory about chemical signatures to do?).

That\u2019s the most important thing men can do.\u201d Four decades after she first marched on the streets of Leeds to stand up for a woman\u2019s right to walk alone at night without fear, another is due to be held for Sarah Everard, who never made it home. A vigil, Reclaim These Streets, will take place at 6pm on Saturday on Clapham Common bandstand in south London, near where the 33-year-old marketing executive was last seen as she walked home last Wednesday.  As well as compelling hundreds of women to share their own experiences of feeling unsafe in public, Everard\u2019s disappearance spurred a discussion about what more men could do to be better allies, including addressing problematic behaviour from fellow men. Garthwaite highlights the White Ribbon charity, which works to end male violence against women and girls, as a good place for men to start. \u201cThere are plenty of opportunities in life where the subject will come up, for example at work. Men can show their support for women by raising awareness and trying to get through to other men,\u201d said Garthwaite, now a Labour councillor for Headingley and Hyde Park in Leeds. \u201cI\u2019m sad marches like this are still necessary, but they are.\u201d While attitudes have changed somewhat since the first Reclaim the Night marches in November 1977, the fact that women\u2019s choices are still picked apart when they go missing, are harassed or face violence shows how little has really changed when it comes to perceptions of their safety, she added. \u201cQuestions are asked about how late it was, why was she alone, what was she wearing, what did she expect \u2013 it\u2019s really depressing that these things are still being said in this day and age.\u201d It is not a far cry from what was then a general attitude in 1977: if a woman went out alone at night and something bad happened, either she was not believed or it was treated as her fault \u2013 she had \u201casked for it\u201d, so she should not expect sympathy, Garthwaite said. At a time when a serial killer \u2013 later known to be Peter Sutcliffe \u2013 was on the loose, there was still a pervasive view that \u201cnice girls don\u2019t get raped\u201d. Sexual harassment was viewed then as a part of life, she said, so when women marched through Leeds at 10.30pm chanting \u201cWherever we go, however we dress, yes means yes and no means no\u201d, Garthwaite said, \u201ca lot of people didn\u2019t understand what we were talking about\u201d. \u201cWe were marching for the right to be able to go out at night, as and when we please, to go to work or to an evening class, to meet friends \u2013 to just have freedom of movement.\u201d After the rally, they dispersed to their homes, in transport organised ahead of time so nobody was walking home alone. General education for males from school age about what is acceptable and respectful behaviour was fundamental, Garthwaite said. \u201cWe should be educating boys about what men should and shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d  Encouraging women to report to the police, designing safe public spaces, and criminalising all forms of sexual harassment \u2013 including making misogyny a hate crime \u2013 would all make predators think twice, she added, as would training in workplaces such as bars, clubs, hotels and taxis on how to effectively respond to reports or instances of sexual harassment or abusive behaviour. \u201cI\u2019m glad that women have not given up, that we\u2019re still asserting our right to have freedom,\u201d Garthwaite said. \u201cBut boys should grow up feeling ready to be held accountable, and girls should feel able to not have to think it\u2019s their fault.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Jeremy Bamber lawyers hopeful for release as fresh legal challenge launched", "full_article": "Jeremy Bamber, who has been imprisoned for more than 35 years for murdering five members of his family, has said he is \u201cfilled with hope\u201d of being released after submitting a fresh legal challenge against his conviction. Bamber\u2019s lawyers have compiled a dossier running to thousands of pages based on new evidence that challenges his 1986 conviction for the notorious White House Farm murders in Essex. On Wednesday the submission was made to Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which will now decide if the case should be referred to the court of appeal for a second time. Mark Newby, Bamber\u2019s solicitor who specialises in miscarriages of justice and helped overturn the wrongful conviction of Victor Nealon after nearly 17 years, said: \u201cMr Bamber is going back to the CCRC because he got a significant amount of fresh evidence to show the conviction is unsafe. It is now for the CCRC to decide.\u201d The challenge is based on 347,000 pages of evidence, including Essex police logs, that were originally withheld from Bamber under public interest immunity laws that no longer apply after 30 years. Bamber said he had \u201cmultiple grounds\u201d for an appeal. He told the Guardian: \u201cOur comprehensive submissions contain the evidence to prove that the jury at my trial were not provided with the full facts and that they were misled repeatedly. \u201cI am filled with hope and anticipation that the new submissions to the CCRC will achieve a speedy referral to the court of appeal.\u201d The CCRC has a duty to refer the case if it believes there is a reasonable chance the court of appeal will quash Bamber\u2019s conviction. Bamber\u2019s adoptive parents, Nevill and June Bamber, were shot dead inside their Essex farm in the early hours of 7 August 1985, along with their adopted daughter, Sheila Caffell, and her six-year-old twin boys. Bamber, then 24, phoned the police to say his father had called him at 3.26am, saying Caffell had \u201cgone crazy and has the gun\u201d. Initially, police believed Caffell, a 28-year-old model known as Bambi who had recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned the gun on herself. But then Bamber\u2019s relatives found a silencer in the farm that was said to contain blood belonging to Caffell. And in September 1985, Bamber\u2019s ex-girlfriend told police he had discussed killing his family. Days later Bamber was charged with the murders. At trial, the prosecution argued that, motivated by the prospect of inheriting the \u00a3436,000 family fortune and considerable land, he had killed all five then placed the rifle in his sister\u2019s hands to make it look like a murder-suicide. It claimed it was impossible for Caffell to have shot herself with the silencer on because her arms were not long enough to pull the trigger and that Nevill Bamber could not have called his son at 3.26am because by then he had been shot. At the end of the trial in October 1986, the jury was sent out to reach a verdict, but returned to ask the judge for clarification on the silencer and blood evidence. The judge said it contained only Caffell\u2019s blood, and instructed the jury that the silencer \u201ccould, on its own, lead them to believe that Bamber was guilty\u201d. The jury convicted Bamber by a 10 to two majority. He has always maintained his innocence. But the jury was not told of a letter from the head of biology at Huntingdon Forensic Science Laboratories saying the blood on the silencer could have come from Sheila Caffell or another relative, Robert Boutflour who has since died. Last year a high court judge denied Bamber access to documents that may have suggested a second silencer was found at the scene, but Mr Justice Knowles said new evidence in the case should be considered by the CCRC. Newby said the new submission contains a \u201cplethora of evidence\u201d from the previously withheld documents pointing to a second silencer. It also includes phone logs to show Nevill Bamber did call his son 10 minutes before Bamber called the police. \u201cIf as a result of the fresh evidence, it is accepted that there were two calls including one call from his father and one from Jeremy, then it is an impossibility for Jeremy Bamber to have been at the scene at the relevant time to have committed the offences.\u201d Newby said. In total Newby said there were eight grounds for appeal including new evidence that the scene had been tampered with by Essex police and that police had seen signs of life inside the house while Bamber was with officers outside. Newby was first approached by Bamber\u2019s supporters in late 2016. He said: \u201cWe would not have spent so much time pursuing this were we not convinced there is a significant evidence to suggest a miscarriage of justice.\u201d He added: \u201cThe evidence now supports the fact that every part of the reported case appears to be untrue, and there is now a new narrative to be told which if accepted by the commission and then in turn the court of appeal should lead to Jeremy Bamber being exonerated.\u201d The CCRC is expected to take several months to review the dossier. It has rejected two previous appeals by Bamber\u2019s former lawyers. \u201cThis is the most substantive submission by a mile,\u201d Newby said.

This would mean that Elliott is available to answer questions about specific horses, but \u201cin relation to the day-to-day training, [Foster] is responsible for everything that goes on up there and she\u2019s given a commitment to that effect\u201d. \nWhile it remains unclear if the IHRB has communicated this formally to its British counterpart, a BHA spokesperson said on Thursday: \u201cWe welcome the comments from the IHRB chief executive which have clarified the position to make clear that Denise Foster is now entirely responsible for the training of horses based at Cullentra. \n\u201cAs the licensing authority, it is now for the IHRB to enforce the suspension in line with the outcome of last Friday\u2019s hearing which placed the sanction clearly on Mr Elliott. Assurances have also been provided that Gordon Elliott Racing will not be promoted at Cheltenham or other courses in Great Britain whilst in the care of Denise Foster.\u201d \nThe IHRB, meanwhile, also published further details on Thursday of a referrals committee hearing on Wednesday into the case of Rob James, an amateur rider who steered Elliott\u2019s Native Milan to victory at last year\u2019s Cheltenham Festival. A video of James briefly climbing on to a horse which had died next to a gallop emerged two days after the picture of Elliott started to circulate on social media. \nJames, who lost his riders\u2019 licence for four months with a further eight months suspended at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, told the panel that he was 22 at the time of the incident in August 2016 and riding work for the trainer Colin Bowe. He had been asked to assist with the removal of the horse, Three Hail Marys, which had died of a heart attack while exercising, and that a \u201csenior member of staff\u201d encouraged him to jump on the horse. \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    Lingfield Park 12.30 Stopnsearch 1.00 Caribeno 1.30 Rafiki 2.05 Going Places (nap) 2.40 Say It As It Is 3.15 Axel Jacklin 3.50 Martineo\n    Sandown 1.55 Song Of The Hunter 2.30 Dostal Phil (nb) 3.05 Lecale\u2019s Article 3.40 Frero Banbou 4.15 Bard Of Brittany 4.45 Sexy Lot\n    Leicester 2.20 Espoir De Romay 2.55 Monsieur Lecoq 3.30 Lots Of Luck 4.05 Cobra Commander 4.35 Colonel Keating 5.10 Tango De Juilly\n    Wolverhampton 4.10 Miracle Garden 4.40 Andre Amar 5.15 Kath\u2019s Toyboy 5.45 Twice Adaay 6.15 Sea The Shells 6.45 Sky Bright 7.15 Star Ascending 7.45 Dawn Treader 8.15 Katheefa\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \nBeing \u201cyoung and naive\u201d, James said that he \u201creacted to the peer pressure and did so for a couple of seconds before patting the mare as he got off her\u201d.

On the same day, he killed himself. In suicide notes written in French and English, he explained that the burden of illness (he suffered from a neurological pain disorder) and his loss of hope for the future had led him to despair. After railing against the decline of western civilization and attacks on free speech, he wrote that he had decided to \u201cleave his modest wealth to certain causes and people\u201d. Allusions to the \u201c14 words\u201d slogan used by white supremacists offered a clue as to the causes he favored. The beneficiaries of Bachelier\u2019s largesse were all either prominent far-right agitators, or platforms offering them a home. The donations immediately attracted the attention of cybersecurity researchers, extremism watchers and law enforcement officers. Bachelier gave the video platform BitChute two bitcoins (in January, the price of a single bitcoin ranged between $30,000 and $40,000). The neo-Nazi website the Daily Stormer got one, the French Holocaust denier Vincent Reynouard got 1.5, and the US white nationalist celebrity Nick Fuentes, an attendee of the riots in Charlottesville and the rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol in Washington, received 13.5 \u2013 worth over $450,000. A Guardian investigation can now reveal that one of the lesser-known beneficiaries is a YouTube influencer of sorts \u2013 one with a history of promoting far-right political ideology. Luke Smith, now a Florida resident, maintains a monetized YouTube channel with 109,000 subscribers. He received at least one bitcoin from Bachelier, valued at the time of writing at just over $30,000. It\u2019s possible that Bachelier saw in Luke Smith a like mind and a shared purpose. Beyond their common ground in far-right politics, each saw technology as a weapon in their war against liberal, tolerant societies. Like Bachelier, Smith eschews so-called proprietary software \u2013 like MacOS or Microsoft Word \u2013 and communications tools like Facebook or Twitter, built and controlled by Silicon Valley firms. Instead, Smith is an advocate for so-called \u201copen source software\u201d \u2013 the kind that makes it possible to use, copy, redistribute and modify software legally. And recently, he has been promoting communications platforms that might help extremists to operate beyond the reach of censorship \u2013 and even the law. What Smith preaches: a war against the modern world The man being funded by Bachelier\u2019s donation likes to present himself as a latter-day Ted Kaczynski \u2013 the so-called Unabomber, whose infamous manifesto Smith has at times earnestly recommended to his followers. Kaczynski, a terrorist still imprisoned for a 17-year bombing campaign that killed three and injured 23, was motivated by a hatred of the modern technological world. In recent years, his apocalyptic account of an industrial civilization on the brink of collapse has resonated with rightwing extremists \u2013 including the Christchurch mosque murderer, Brenton Tarrant \u2013 who describe themselves as \u201ceco-fascists\u201d. In 2019, Smith said in a video he wanted to live in a \u201cUnabomber cabin\u201d to escape the surveillance and censorship which he believes is especially aimed at the far right. In a post on his blog in the same year \u2013 since deleted \u2013 he described the modern world as one \u201cwhere your every action is watched, if you use proprietary software and communicate only via social media services\u201d.    The fantasy of the US splintering along ethnic lines has long been entertained by white nationalists    Public records show that Smith moved to a rural property that year near Mayo, in northern Florida, whose title is held by a family member. Since then, most of his videos have been recorded in and around the property. In various videos and podcasts, Smith rehearses other ideas associated with the far right. He advocates breaking the US up \u2013 potentially into racial enclaves \u201cmaybe [by] dividing by states, maybe [by] dividing by ethnic groups\u201d. The fantasy of the US splintering along ethnic lines has long been entertained by white nationalists, who have taken to calling themselves the \u201cBalk Right\u201d. This is not the only place where Smith touches on ideas associated with white nationalism. In a 2018 podcast, he offers an account of human history that relies on arguments made in The 10,000 Year Explosion, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a white nationalist book. Smith also directed readers to websites like radishmag, where readers are asked to \u201creconsider\u201d slavery and lynching is painted in a positive light. Luke Smith did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Taken together, these beliefs come back to another far-right splinter ideology: the neoreactionary movement, which in the last decade has been enjoying an online renaissance of sorts, especially among some of Silicon Valley\u2019s tech elite. The birth of the neoreactionary movement The neoreactionary movement traces its history to 2007, when the Silicon Valley entrepreneur Curtis Yarvin started a popular blog under the pseudonym Mencius Moldbug. He used it to attack liberalism, democracy and equality, discussed racial hierarchy in the euphemistic terms of \u201chuman biodiversity\u201d, and counseled followers to simply detach themselves from the society ruled by the institutions of liberalism. Journalist Corey Pein wrote an account of the culture of Silicon Valley which, in part, examines the influence that Yarvin\u2019s ideas had in the tech world. Pein says that while neoreactionary ideology is somewhat incoherent, what is consistent is the members\u2019 commitment to extricate themselves from liberal democracy. This \u201cexit\u201d doctrine was influential among some Silicon Valley leaders, including the tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who once memorably said: \u201cI no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\u201d Smith follows the same ideological path. His principal outlet for these ideas is his YouTube channel, where he offers tutorials on how to use austere open source software applications, encouraging viewers to detach themselves from Silicon Valley\u2019s products. The channel is both relatively successful and lucrative, and followers rate him highly. His videos have had more than 18.7m views, meaning he could earn anywhere up to $31,100 a year from his channel on current numbers.    Smith has been pushing users in the direction of decentralized social media platforms in the so-called 'fediverse'    YouTube confirmed that Smith\u2019s channel remained in their partner program, meaning that he continues to earn money from the channel, but that they had removed one video, featuring racial slurs, which the Guardian had asked about. Smith has lately been pushing users in the direction of decentralized, resilient social media platforms in the so-called \u201cfediverse\u201d, a network of independent social media sites that communicate with one another, and allow people to interact across different sites. This could allow far-right activists to operate in ways that make them very difficult to shut down. Though many prominent programmers and advocates in both the wider open source software movement and the fediverse are motivated by progressive, anti-corporate or anti-authoritarian political ideals, now the tools they have created might be used to shelter far-right extremists from the consequences of their hate speech and organizing. Manipulating the open source movement for nefarious ends The free and open source software movement has attracted many people with progressive politics, who have used it to help provide digital tools to those with few resources, to breathe new life into hardware that might otherwise have been added to a growing mountain of e-waste, or to move public institutions from Barcelona to Bras\u00edlia away from dependence on expensive software. However, experts say that it is not surprising that someone like Smith would be tolerated or even welcomed by some elements of open source culture. Megan Squire is a professor of computer science at Elon University who has published research on both the far right and open source software communities. She says that \u201cthe dominant open source culture historically has been one of extreme misogyny, unfounded meritocracy, toxicity and abuse of everyone,\u201d and that Smith is one of those resisting efforts to change that culture. In recent years, and especially since the Gamergate movement intensified scrutiny on toxicity in tech, some responded to the blatant sexism, antisemitism and racism online with codes of conduct after realizing this behavior was actually starting to hurt them (Squires says they couldn\u2019t recruit and retain developers). The provision of safer online spaces for marginalized groups is a large part of the motivation of many of the people who have created the underlying software. On those platforms, tools for moderation and easy ways to flag sensitive content are baked in by design. But Smith is among a small group who repeatedly rail against the introduction of such codes of conduct within open source projects.    Some open source communications platforms do away with the need for servers by implementing a 'peer-to-peer' network    In a video recorded a week after the Capitol riots, when social media bans were removing rightwingers from Donald Trump down to prevent further violence, Smith said that those who wanted to bypass censorship should use the Twitter-like platform, Pleroma. Open source software like Pleroma, Mastodon and Matrix reproduce the functions of Twitter, allowing users to send out brief messages to followers. But their implementation and structure are much more decentralized, allowing anyone to set up their own platform on their own server, after which they can join up, or \u201cfederate\u201d, with other such communities. Some open source communications platforms go a step beyond this, and do away with the need for servers altogether by implementing a \u201cpeer-to-peer\u201d network. PeerTube, for example, allows users to browse and watch videos in a similar way to YouTube, but instead of streaming it to users from a central server, each user watching a video acts as a relay point. The technical details are perhaps less important than the practical effect: no one has authority over these platforms: no one owns them. While governments and users can place pressure on the big social media companies to ban problematic users or communities, for better or worse, no one can stop anyone creating their own servers or peer-to-peer networks. These technologies, then, are effectively uncensorable. According to a report by Emmi Bevensee, the co-founder of research consultancy Rebellious Data and the social media monitoring tool SMAT, extremists have been advocating, and even developing them, for years.    The reason I want it as a trans anti-fascist is the same reason that a Nazi wants it; we just have opposite ends  Emmi Bevensee     \u201cEvery marginalized community knows what it\u2019s like to be systematically deplatformed\u201d, says Bevensee, who uses non-binary pronouns, pointing to the way in which groups such as sex workers have adopted platforms like Mastodon after finding themselves unable to advertise their services. But as Bevensee\u2019s report shows, peer-to-peer platforms are a double-edged sword. \u201cThe reason I want it as a trans anti-fascist is the same reason that a Nazi wants it; we just have opposite ends,\u201d they explain. \u201cYou know who really doesn\u2019t understand it? The FBI,\u201d Bevensee adds: \u201cwe\u2019re talking about a technology that can\u2019t be subpoenaed. It can\u2019t be surveiled\u201d and, in order to carry out remote surveillance of private chats, \u201cyou would have to back door every single device in the world\u201d. This opens the way for extremists to propagandize and organize on platforms that are beyond the reach of legal authorities and tech giants alike. After the far right-friendly social media site Gab encountered hosting problems and app store bans, it rebuilt itself on Mastodon\u2019s software, despite determined opposition from the platform\u2019s creators and users. Beyond Gab\u2019s ambiguous place in the fediverse, the Guardian found dozens of servers using peer-to-peer, open source tools, which were either exclusively or disproportionately devoted either to far-right politics, or to conspiracy theories that mainstream social media services have previously cracked down on, including coronavirus denialism, \u201cincel\u201d culture and neo-Nazism. With the far right under pressure from mainstream social media companies and internet hosts, this may be just the beginning. But experts say that despite their recurrent complaints about Silicon Valley\u2019s platforms, extremists will maintain their foothold in the mainstream for as long as they can. As Squire says of Smith\u2019s internet activity: \u201cWhy is he still on YouTube? Because that\u2019s where the eyeballs are, that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d \u2022 In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is at 800-273-8255 or chat for support.

The report was published the day after the communities secretary reversed his original decision that the mine did not conflict with national policy and was a local matter. Robert Jenrick cited rising controversy and new climate advice as reasons for the U-turn. The government had been criticised by its own climate advisers and leading scientists for failing to block the coalmine, which would produce fuel for steel production rather than electricity generation. Critics said the pit plan seriously undermined the UK\u2019s leadership as it prepares to host a crucial UN climate summit in November. There will now be a public inquiry but it is unclear whether the final decision will be made before the UN summit. The report said the green jobs in Cumbria would mostly result from a quadrupling of renewable energy and energy efficiency overhauls of 90% of buildings over the next 15 years. All seven councils in Cumbria have pledged to become carbon neutral and a target to be net zero by 2037 has been set by the Zero Carbon Cumbria Partnership, which is co-chaired by the county council. Creating the jobs would require many billions of pounds in investment, but the report\u2019s backers said the government\u2019s commitment to a green industrial revolution and to levelling up less affluent parts of the country could support this. \u201cWe have a global responsibility to do our bit,\u201d said Karen Mitchell, the chief executive of Cumbria Action for Sustainability, the organisation that commissioned the report. \u201cThe coalmine is just looking backwards: why invest in that instead of in new technologies that have a longer-term future?\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019re in a climate emergency and Cumbria is often at the frontline of that.\u201d The county has been hit by the worst flooding in centuries in recent years, with scientists finding the 2015 floods were made significantly more likely by global heating. Mitchell said she understood the need for jobs in the county, some parts of which are among the poorest in England. But she said green jobs bring additional benefits such as cutting people\u2019s heating bills, reducing air pollution and boosting healthy travel such as cycling: \u201cThere are lots of co-benefits that you don\u2019t get when you\u2019re sending people down a deep dark hole.\u201d Prof Rebecca Willis from the University of Lancaster said: \u201cThe Whitehaven coalmine proposals are totally at odds with UK climate legislation. Cumbria shouldn\u2019t be chasing dirty jobs with no future, it should be working with government to bring green investment to an area that really needs it.\u201d Cumbria council approved the mine in October. But as the backlash grew, the council said in February it would reconsider the decision in order to take into account climate advice published in December by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), the same advice now cited by Jenrick.   Related: \u2018Absolutely ridiculous\u2019: top scientist slams UK government over coalmine    If approved, the \u00a3165m project would be the UK\u2019s first underground mine in 30 years and produce 2.7m tonnes of coking coal a year. The government said this coal would otherwise have to be imported, but about 85% of the coal is planned for export and there is no shortage of such coal globally. West Cumbria Mining, the company behind the plan, threatened legal action against the council last week, while opponents have also threatened court action against the government. The green jobs report, funded by a philanthropic foundation, estimated that 5,800 jobs could be created in renewable energy, mostly onshore wind and solar. Another 2,000 jobs could be in retrofitting most of the 250,000 dwellings in Cumbria, and 500 jobs could be in waste management, increasing the recycling rate to 90%. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK is a world leader in the fight against climate change, and we are determined to seize the economic opportunities and build back greener from the pandemic by supporting up to 2m green jobs across the country \u2013 including Cumbria \u2013 by 2030.\u201d The government said its \u00a312bn plan for a green industrial revolution would unlock three times as much private sector investment and support up to 250,000 green jobs by 2030. On Thursday, the government announced a \u00a395m investment in two new offshore wind ports to be constructed in the Humber region and Teesside, creating 6,000 jobs. It plans to end coal burning in power stations by October 2024. Some northern MPs reacted angrily to Jenrick\u2019s U-turn, with one, Mark Jenkinson, calling it a \u201ckick in the teeth\u201d, but Greenpeace said it was \u201cbetter late than never\u201d. Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, said: \u201cAfter months of pressure, ministers have finally been forced to act. The government must now block the mine and focus instead on creating low-carbon jobs in Cumbria and across the country with a proper green stimulus.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Road pollution affects 94% of Great Britain, study finds", "full_article": "Pollution from roads affects virtually every part of Great Britain, with 94% of land having some pollution above background levels, according to research. Roads, which occupy less than 1% of the country, \u201cform vast, pervasive and growing networks, causing negative environmental impacts\u201d, the scientists said. The most widespread pollutants are tiny particles, mostly from fossil fuel burning, nitrogen dioxide from diesel vehicles, and noise and light. More than 70% of the country is affected by all of these, with the only land to escape road pollution being almost entirely at high altitudes. The serious impact on human health from road pollution in urban areas is well known. But the researchers said even low levels of pollution may harm wildlife including birds, mammals and insects, although research to date is limited. The findings are likely to apply to densely populated regions around the world, the scientists said, and roadless areas are expected to become increasingly scarce due to the predicted 65% expansion of the global road network by 2050. Today, there are an estimated 64m kilometres of road on Earth, a length equivalent to travelling 1,600 times around the equator. Ben Phillips, of the University of Exeter, UK, who led the research, said: \u201cIn Great Britain, we basically live on an island completely covered by roads. We found half of land is no more than 216 metres from a road. That\u2019s a really shocking and quite depressing statistic and it seems like that would have massive environmental consequences.\u201d   Pollution from roads extends across most of Britain   \u201cPollution from roads impairs small animals by disguising the scent of flowers, fertilising habitats [with nitrogen] so they become unsuitable for specialist species, and spilling light pollution that disrupts their movements and life-cycles,\u201d said Matt Shardlow, of the conservation group Buglife. \u201cThis research exposes that the impact of roads has become omnipresent in the UK. In particular, microplastic pollution from car tyres is an emerging issue that must be addressed.\u201d The research, published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, concludes: \u201cThe ubiquity of road pollution should be seriously considered as a potential contributor to global and regional-scale environmental issues such as insect declines.\u201d The researchers started with maps of roads from motorways down to local access roads. \u201cWe found that 25% of land was less than 79 metres from a road, 50% of land was less than 216 metres away and 75% of land was less than 527 metres from a road,\u201d they said. They used available data on exhaust, metal, light, and noise pollution and how it disperses to estimate the total area affected. Background levels were deemed to be 0.1% of the level on the roads for particles and chemicals and 0.001% for light and noise, which are usually measured using exponential scales. The study did not calculate the impact of other pollutants, such as de-icing salt and herbicides used on verges, or include the contamination of ponds and streams, vehicle-wildlife collisions and the habitat fragmentation caused by roads.   Related: New map reveals shattering effect of roads on nature    Previous studies of human health indicate that impacts from air pollution occur up to 500 metres from roads, and air pollution is known to harm birds, mammals and insects. Other research has shown roads can reduce populations of mammals up to 5km away. Across Europe, 98% of land is this close to a road. The researchers said the extent of the influence of roads on the environment has been \u201csomewhat overlooked and underestimated\u201d. Phillips said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got global-scale environmental pressures and people always point at agriculture, because agriculture is absolutely everywhere across the country. The point we\u2019re making is that road pollution is another thing that\u2019s absolutely everywhere, even though it\u2019s low level.\u201d Shardlow said: \u201cWhile roads are contributing to insect declines and extinctions, much of the harm can be eased: lighting can be reduced, electric cars will reduce chemical pollution, wildlife bridges can be built to reconnect nature, and verges are increasingly managed to boost populations of wildflowers and pollinators.\u201d The UK government is planning a \u00a327bn expansion of England\u2019s road network, but the Guardian reported in February that transport secretary, Grant Shapps, had overridden official advice to review the policy on environmental grounds.

In the US, Netflix\u2019s biggest and most important market, it faces even more intense competition from a new wave of entrants including AT&amp;T\u2019s HBO Max, Comcast\u2019s Peacock and ViacomCBS\u2019s Paramount+.

Looking up at the trees helped me get to sleep. So maybe I\u2019ve always been on a wooden wavelength. I\u2019ve spent all my adult life working with trees, and the past 14 years working at the RBGE as a curator. Recently, our fundraising team was looking for novel suggestions to raise money to help save the giant redwood avenue at our site in Benmore. Some of the staff suggested I do a sponsored tree huggathon. They knew I\u2019d been a tree hugger since a very early age. When I was small, it was enough to be hugging a birch tree or something pretty tiny that I could reach around with my wee arms. As I grew up, the trees I hugged grew bigger, too. Still, I wasn\u2019t sure people would be interested enough in an old man hugging trees to donate money. But my colleagues thought it was inspired. So I agreed to hug 350 trees, of as many different varieties as I could find, in a year. My approach to the challenge was improvised. I wouldn\u2019t plan what to hug \u2013 it was just cometh the hour, cometh the tree. Weather was not a factor \u2013 in the winter months there were some fantastic trees to hug: paperbark maples, Tibetan cherries with glossy sheens, dogwoods with their signature, fiery red bark. Hugging trees in the snow is especially enriching: you\u2019re acutely aware of the life coursing through them, a sense of them withstanding the elements. In summer, I\u2019d find a scenic spot and lock my arms around one, with the sun streaming through the branches and backlighting the bark. My tree hugging technique is based on a simple principle: making maximum contact. This means wrapping my arms as far round as they\u2019ll go (sometimes a stern stretch for a man my age), and then leaning into the tree. To fit the challenge in every day, I had to give up some meetings, but that was a welcome development. Whenever I got the itch, I\u2019d head out with my colleague, a photographer. It was practically a tree-hugging fashion shoot, with us going on a trek in search of the next tree that spoke to us. At points my colleague, who usually takes serious scientific photographs, struggled to keep a straight face, and I couldn\u2019t help feeling self-conscious \u2013 but I just got on with it. I was struck by how different the experience was with each tree. The most tactile ones stood out, particularly the small giant redwoods. That was in June, when we\u2019d had weeks and weeks of dry weather. You were getting an almost Californian scent from the resin. That transported me. Another highlight was a hybrid wingnut. If you\u2019re familiar with Lord Of The Rings, it looks a bit like an Ent, the talking tree of Middle-earth, because of its craggy features, which are like faces in the bark.  Admittedly, there were a few raised eyebrows from passersby. Some people had a quiet chuckle; maybe they thought it was a quaint Scottish custom. I was the butt of a fair few tree jokes among my family, regularly being called barking mad, but everyone understood it was for a good cause.   Related: Experience: I survived a plane crash    If you\u2019ve never hugged a tree, I strongly recommend it. Getting up close to one makes you appreciate their fantastic structure. If you were to set humans a challenge to create such a wonderful mechanism, they would never be capable of doing it. My dream tree trip is going to California to see the giant redwoods. I wouldn\u2019t be able to hug those, I would just stand back and marvel at them. Closer to home, however hilarious my hugging seemed, I\u2019m delighted that we managed to raise more than double the original target to help save our own resplendent redwoods, which were planted in 1863 by a wealthy American. Tree hugging is a wonderful way of reconnecting with nature on a deep level. That\u2019s something I think we all need more of, with the frenetic pace of modern life. Tree hugging can help us slow down; to appreciate the wee things in life. Above all, trees can teach us patience. Their lifespans are longer than ours, so they help us to connect with a different sense of time. \u2022 As told to James Ware Do you have an experience to share?

It\u2019s just enchanting. Funny and lyrical with something sinister lurking. The book that changed my lifeI read Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison when I was 17 and it blew away everything I thought I knew about what literature was, what literature could do. I remember thinking that I wanted to feel like this every time I read: shaken and in awe. The book I wish I\u2019d writtenSalvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward. Just a perfect book. Only Ward could write it, but I can dream. The book that changed my mindBefore I read Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City by Matthew Desmond, I didn\u2019t know much about the eviction crisis in the US. The book clearly, devastatingly shows how eviction itself can plunge people into poverty. I have thought of it almost daily as news of the pandemic evictions pours in. It has been said, but it still bears repeating: the failure of our government to meet this crisis will have catastrophic and far reaching effects on all aspects of our lives.

The hand-powered, 2,000-year-old device displayed the motion of the universe, predicting the movement of the five known planets, the phases of the moon and the solar and lunar eclipses. But quite how it achieved such impressive feats has proved fiendishly hard to untangle. Now researchers at UCL believe they have solved the mystery \u2013 at least in part \u2013 and have set about reconstructing the device, gearwheels and all, to test whether their proposal works. If they can build a replica with modern machinery, they aim to do the same with techniques from antiquity. \u201cWe believe that our reconstruction fits all the evidence that scientists have gleaned from the extant remains to date,\u201d said Adam Wojcik, a materials scientist at UCL. While other scholars have made reconstructions in the past, the fact that two-thirds of the mechanism are missing has made it hard to know for sure how it worked. The mechanism, often described as the world\u2019s first analogue computer, was found by sponge divers in 1901 amid a haul of treasures salvaged from a merchant ship that met with disaster off the Greek island of Antikythera. The ship is believed to have foundered in a storm in the first century BC as it passed between Crete and the Peloponnese en route to Rome from Asia Minor.     The Antikythera mechanism is estimated to date back to around 80 BC. Photograph: X-Tek Group/AFP    The battered fragments of corroded brass were barely noticed at first, but decades of scholarly work have revealed the object to be a masterpiece of mechanical engineering. Originally encased in a wooden box one foot tall, the mechanism was covered in inscriptions \u2013 a built-in user\u2019s manual \u2013 and contained more than 30 bronze gearwheels connected to dials and pointers. Turn the handle and the heavens, as known to the Greeks, swung into motion. Michael Wright, a former curator of mechanical engineering at the Science Museum in London, pieced together much of how the mechanism operated and built a working replica, but researchers have never had a complete understanding of how the device functioned. Their efforts have not been helped by the remnants surviving in 82 separate fragments, making the task of rebuilding it equivalent to solving a battered 3D puzzle that has most of its pieces missing. Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the UCL team describe how they drew on the work of Wright and others, and used inscriptions on the mechanism and a mathematical method described by the ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides, to work out new gear arrangements that would move the planets and other bodies in the correct way. The solution allows nearly all of the mechanism\u2019s gearwheels to fit within a space only 25mm deep. According to the team, the mechanism may have displayed the movement of the sun, moon and the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn on concentric rings. Because the device assumed that the sun and planets revolved around Earth, their paths were far more difficult to reproduce with gearwheels than if the sun was placed at the centre. Another change the scientists propose is a double-ended pointer they call a \u201cDragon Hand\u201d that indicates when eclipses are due to happen.     Computer model of the mechanism\u2019s gears. Photograph: UCL    The researchers believe the work brings them closer to a true understanding of how the Antikythera device displayed the heavens, but it is not clear whether the design is correct or could have been built with ancient manufacturing techniques. The concentric rings that make up the display would need to rotate on a set of nested, hollow axles, but without a lathe to shape the metal, it is unclear how the ancient Greeks would have manufactured such components. \u201cThe concentric tubes at the core of the planetarium are where my faith in Greek tech falters, and where the model might also falter,\u201d said Wojcik. \u201cLathes would be the way today, but we can\u2019t assume they had those for metal.\u201d Whether or not the model works, more mysteries remain. It is unclear whether the Antikythera mechanism was a toy, a teaching tool or had some other purpose. And if the ancient Greeks were capable of such mechanical devices, what else did they do with the knowledge? \u201cAlthough metal is precious, and so would have been recycled, it is odd that nothing remotely similar has been found or dug up,\u201d Wojcik said. \u201cIf they had the tech to make the Antikythera mechanism, why did they not extend this tech to devising other machines, such as clocks?\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Out of Africa: how Netflix\u2019s ambitions could change the continent\u2019s cinema", "full_article": "It was the sight of donkeys carrying camera equipment that reminded Lemohang Jeremiah Mosese he was shooting in Lesotho. The director was filming This Is Not a Burial, It Is a Resurrection in a remote part of his tiny home nation, which has no cinemas and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 zero film infrastructure. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit daring to take a crew there and shoot because there\u2019s no electricity,\u201d Mosese says from his home in Berlin. \u201cEspecially when we go to the mountains \u2013 we had to rely on the donkeys because at some point we just couldn\u2019t carry the equipment.\u201d The shoot ran on petrol-powered generators. Villagers pitched in as ad-hoc crew members. Many fingers were crossed. \u201cWe had to build everything from scratch,\u201d he says. That approach didn\u2019t harm the film. Critically lauded, the stylish mood piece about grief, community and egregious land development has been entered in the Oscars as the country\u2019s 2021 candidate. In truth, Mosese\u2019s donkey experience is an outlier in the sub-Saharan African cinema world. Most films are made in hubs in Nigeria and South Africa, which have strong domestic scenes. The film industry in Nigeria is worth $600m (\u00a3430m) annually and is the continent\u2019s market leader, while South Africa\u2019s brings in about $35m and has a local scene led by directors such as Neill Blomkamp and Oliver Hermanus, the director of the critically acclaimed Moffie. But it is largely known for \u201cfacilitation\u201d or hosting international film-makers who want to shoot in the country.     This Is Not a Burial, It\u2019s a Resurrection. Photograph: PR    That approach requires government backing, something many African film-makers can\u2019t rely on. \u201cThere were talks about how we should be set in South Africa because they have a film infrastructure. They have funds and tax rebates \u2013 they have all these beautiful things, and we don\u2019t have any,\u201d says Mosese of Lesotho, which has a sluggish economy and mounting debts. Although the film was ultimately shot in Lesotho, his crew mostly crossed the border from South Africa, where many had learned their trade working on domestic television shows. But for people outside those two large bubbles, things are not as accessible. Mosese and his friends who wanted to work in film had two options, he says: work domestically on films made by NGOs (invariably about the Aids crisis, which is still ravaging the country) or travel to Europe to forge a career in the diaspora. \u201cI was always appalled by this idea that NGOs are dictating how the film should look and what the message is,\u201d he says. \u201cSo me and some other friends of mine, we just took a different route, which is a slow one.\u201d There are growing options for directors on the continent. Africa\u2019s film-making ecology can roughly be divided into three categories: domestic, fuelled by scenes such as Nollywood; arthouse, such as Mosese\u2019s work, which has a home on the European and US festival circuit; and international, the increasing number of hits such as Kenya\u2019s Rafiki that make waves at the global box office. As well as the aesthetic battle for Africa\u2019s image there are also more basic concerns for film-makers such as Mosese. On the whole, the continent\u2019s film crews are localised and separated, meaning a camera operator who plies their trade on a Nollywood set is rarely seen on a Kenyan or South African shoot. Further north in Uganda that lack of crossover led Imperial Blue\u2019s British producer, David Cecil, to search for the crew for his drug drama from the Kampala film school at which he was teaching. Cecil says the main challenge was getting access to crew and equipment, while the upsides included less red tape and more freedom to shoot. \u201cIt\u2019s great in terms of access to locations and getting stuff done. For example, if I want a certain type of face paint I can get it, now \u2013 there\u2019s no kind of procedure or \u2018let\u2019s have a meeting about it\u2019,\u201d he says.     Imperial Blue. Photograph: Publicity image    Semulema Daniel Katenda, the Ugandan co-producer on Imperial Blue, says that although film-making in Uganda is less bureaucratic, there is a \u201cbroken chain link\u201d in the country, with directors not able to get their film shown at cinemas. \u201cThe biggest problem we have is the link between the film-maker and the audience,\u201d he says. \u201cWe rely on our home audience to watch our films, but the distribution between the audience and the Ugandan film-maker is nonexistent right now.\u201d Netflix claims it wants to be one of the links in that chain. Last year, ahead of the release of Queen Sono, its African spy drama, the chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, and a team of executives travelled to Lagos to map out their plans, which included investing heavily in local talent. On a continent with 54 countries and more than 1 billion people, where internet access has leapt by almost 25% in less than 10 years, the attraction is obvious. Ben Amadasun, director of Africa originals and acquisitions at Netflix, identifies a dearth of production facilities, post houses and soundstages as major hindrances to Africa becoming a major international player, plus the cost of technical equipment. The other major hurdle is funding, which is hard to secure; even when it is found, distribution can scupper plans. \u201cThere\u2019s not always a ready market for all those titles to be sold or to get a good return on investment,\u201d he says. Netflix is looking to buy content in all three main categories of African film. It recently acquired Mati Diop\u2019s Atlantics, which was the first film directed by a black woman to play in competition at Cannes. It has also started to invest in remakes of classic Nollywood films, with Amadasun saying that, as it looks to build up an African audience, Netflix will be focusing on popular fare with a proven track record.     Atlantics. Photograph: Nettflix    \u201cI would say overall there is sometimes a slant to titles that are a bit lighter, like romance, action, comedy \u2013 programming categories that appeal generally to bigger audiences, especially when you\u2019re in the early stage of growth in the market,\u201d he says. Whether that will work for African producers and directors such as Katenda and Mosese is debatable and Netflix still has no office on the continent, with operations being run from its Amsterdam base. Mosese is pleased with the investment, but it\u2019s clear he sees himself as sitting outside Netflix\u2019s orbit. \u201cNetflix is specifically interested in films that everybody can digest. It would be rad to have a film that\u2019s a meditation about death or about a 70-year-old widow v God,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will be totally impossible, but I\u2019m very hopeful that in the future they would consider films that are not \u2018typically Netflix\u2019.\u201d Amadasun is keen to point out that Netflix is looking beyond the big two of Nigeria and South Africa. Kenya is interesting, he says, as is Ghana and the Democratic Republic of Congo, while Mozambique and Angola are on its radar. Furthermore, while Cannes and Venice are important, in the Netflix African equation so are the Zanzibar and Durban film festivals. Existential mood pieces may not be on the shopping list right now, but as Netflix expands it wants to take chances. As difficult as conditions can be, the work of a new crop of directors including Mosese, Diop, Wauri Kahiu, Apolline Traor\u00e9 and Rungano Nyoni is changing the image of the continent. Diop\u2019s Atlantics tells the migrant story but reimagines it as an otherworldly horror; Traor\u00e9\u2019s Moi Zaphira and Fronti\u00e8res are bracing female-focused stories about everyday life, while Nyoni has explored witchcraft and western biases surrounding the burqa. While the work of celebrated African film-makers such as Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne, Djibril Diop Mamb\u00e9ty and Souleymane Ciss\u00e9 was toasted at European festivals, few of the earlier directors had the potential to reach such a wide audience.     Samantha Mugatsia in Rafiki, directed by Wanuri Kahlu. Photograph: Courtesy Big World Cinema    Alongside that, there\u2019s the Afrofuturist, predominantly African American vision of the continent that can be seen in the grandeur of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Black Is King, and in the outlandish worlds of Black Panther\u2019s Wakanda and Coming 2 America\u2019s Zamunda. But some are wary of that Afrofuturist fantasy of advanced tech, opulent isolationism and problematic royal bathers. Katenda says he is cautious about people from overseas creating a standardised image of the continent based on Black Is King and Black Panther. \u201cThen everybody\u2019s going to try to adopt Africa\u2019s image to this,\u201d he says. Last year, Africa produced its first animated feature, made in Nigeria and self-funded. Micro-budget projects have taken off in South Africa, as traditional funding routes become blocked off because of the pandemic. The kind of improvisation and innovation seen on Mosese\u2019s set is a constant on a continent that is \u2013 in many regions and areas of cinema \u2013 still developing.

Sharing a cooking space with a loved one is an unending test of patience, and we should all be more upfront about it on the first date. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Grace,\u201d I would say before even taking off my coat. \u201cI always own at least six jars of stale mint sauce and I leave a trail of cumin seeds wherever I go. Oh, and just a heads-up, I don\u2019t put the lids back on jars properly.\u201d Charles, meanwhile, should have been more specific, before I fell in love with him, about his frankly unhinged belief that runny things \u2013 mayo, hot sauce, marmalade \u2013 have to be kept refrigerated. This means that every cubic inch of the fridge is stuffed with ketchups, jams and mustards, with no space for any actual food. This position is both berserk and untenable. \u201cBut jam doesn\u2019t go off!\u201d I say 10 times a month. \u201cIt\u2019s a preserve!\u201d \u201cWell, it wouldn\u2019t go off if you screwed the lid back on properly and stopped putting a buttery knife in it so it grows mould,\u201d he invariably replies. His expression is weary, and of having lived through so much.Real kitchens are full of these endless, everyday ructions. In fact, ignoring how annoying we all are to share space with is the bread and butter of real love and friendship. Love is turning a blind eye to squashed tea bags that don\u2019t quite make it to the bin and instead sit forlornly on the breadboard. Or tolerating the mystery teenage sandwich maker who leaves the bread out to go stale at 3am and the kitchen lights ablaze. Love is bin bags that aren\u2019t secured properly, veg peelings on the floor and smiling sweetly at those among us who put empty milk cartons back in the fridge and never refill the pepper grinder. Love is tolerating that person who rarely, if ever, fills the dishwasher, yet holds strong feelings on exactly how it should be stacked. \u201cForks go upright in the fork drawer,\u201d they\u2019ll tell you, over your shoulder, while somehow missing the fact that you load the machine 14 times a week without their instruction.One of the chief reasons we adore cookery shows, I believe, is that they\u2019re not filmed in real kitchens. Well, they are, but they\u2019re not; it\u2019s very clever. The lights are on, but there\u2019s no one at home. On Saturday Kitchen and Sunday Brunch, each time the cameras turn off, a small army of food technicians rush in with sprays, mops and sponges. They ferry in trays of ingredients all neatly chopped for the chefs\u2019 next work of art, then disappear, but not before neatening and dusting the rows of spices in the racks in the background. It is not a real kitchen in which anyone leaves a pile of used underwear in a shrine in front of the washing machine, having meant to begin a wash, only to realise the machine\u2019s still full from two days back. When Simon Rimmer makes bechamel sauce, there\u2019s no one standing behind him with the nozzle of the squirty cream in their gob. When the guests drink wine, the glasses are never gritty because someone forgot to add salt to the dishwasher, which leads to an argument over who last unblocked the filter. In these make-believe spaces, which we all love so much, all the spats and bad feeling are removed, and all that\u2019s left is a place where the chef can be charismatic and play with a six-burner Bosch cooktop. I, too, am guilty of this make-believe: on a recent ITV programme, I made \u201chomemade\u201d fudge in my million-pound, state-of-the-art kitchen on gleaming quartz worktops and surrounded by playthings such as my avant-garde sous-vide machine, double-fronted, American-style fridge and automatic hot-water tap, all with the backdrop of a perfectly kept autumn garden. But this was not my life. It\u2019s the life of a woman called Julie in Islington who rents out her home for \u00a3800 a day.

First, can it be done safely with all precautions taken to protect the health of cast and crew? And second, is this project really worth it, worth all of the myriad difficulties attached, both financial and logistical? For talky heist romcom Locked Down, it appears as if safety was ensured and maintained (unlike many other shoots, no word emerged of on-set infections) but vitally, the small matter of \u201cbut should we?\u201d appears to have been crucially, and tragically, overlooked. For not only would the film have been an insufferable bore without a global pandemic raging on but given the added stresses and strains and possible danger involved in making it now, its existence feels like even more of an offence, a head-smashingly redundant waste of time, talent, energy and resources, a shockingly early yet entirely convincing contender for worst film of the year.   Related: The White Tiger review \u2013 Balzac-worthy satire of submission and power    Its straight-out-of-the-gate awfulness recalls writer, and Peaky Blinders creator, Steven Knight\u2019s similarly disastrous January stinker Serenity which kicked off 2019 as the year\u2019s most heinous and impressively held that position through to the bitter end. But that film, a pretentious noir thriller starring Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and a giant tuna named Justice, had a twist so hilariously stupid that by the end it became a fun two-bottles-of-wine hate-watch. This time around, however, the only fun one might have is mercifully switching it off in the first act and doing genuinely anything else instead (staring at a blank wall in total silence would be preferable).              What makes its stench that much harder to endure is that in a different universe, with a very different script, there\u2019s something here that could have flown, especially at this moment. On paper, and in the deceptively snappy trailer, the idea of two attractive, charismatic and adept movie stars flirting and arguing their way through a pandemic-assisted Harrods diamond heist seems like a giddy way to spend yet another night stuck in front of the TV. But even an experienced director like Doug Liman, who assembled not dissimilar ingredients with a far surer hand in the slick and entertaining Mr and Mrs Smith, can\u2019t find enough room to breathe with Knight\u2019s ungainly, faux-intellectual dialogue suffocating every scene. As the warring soon-to-be-criminal couple, trapped in a west London house together during the pandemic, a returning Hathaway (who really should know better) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (who deserves much better), also find it hard to sell or even understand much of the sub-latter-day Woody Allen-esque waffle they\u2019re stuck with, sentenced to lines that are both overwritten yet underdeveloped. There are also brief Zoom cameos from Ben Stiller, Mindy Kaling, Stephen Merchant and Ben Kingsley, who can all at least explain away their low-stakes involvement as the result of sheer boredom. We\u2019ve already seen that frantically scrambling together a film during lockdown can result in unlikely greatness, as proved last summer by Rob Savage\u2019s ingenious, micro-budget cyber-horror Host, but when scrambled together without care or time for a much-needed second, third, fourth and fifth draft of the script, the end-product can be forgettable at best and embarrassing at worst. Locked Down is both and more, a dull assemblage of half-thought-through ideas written with such utter shoddiness, it\u2019s a miracle HBO Max ended up buying it (its swift last-minute dump implies some serious buyer\u2019s remorse). As a heist movie it\u2019s willfully unexciting and fully incompetent, with a barely comprehensible and bizarrely unmotivated scheme riddled with glaring plot-holes and as a romantic comedy, it\u2019s equally dead on arrival thanks to a pair of lovers who hardly make sense as fictional characters let alone real people. Both actors work admirably hard at putting a sheen on the material, using their considerable combined charm for some painfully heavy lifting, but as the punishingly overlong two-hour film progresses (it will be a miracle if even half of its viewers make it past the midpoint), they find it impossible to do anything other than keep their heads down in shame and race to the finale, hoping to emerge unscathed.      The film is hinged on a rather regrettable gender dynamic that suggests the pair \u2013 her, an accomplished bread-winning businesswoman and him, a sober wannabe poet called Paxton who\u2019s lost his \u201cwild\u201d side after being forced into a low-level driving job because he was convicted of killing a man in a noble fight years earlier (!?!?!) \u2013 would be much happier if they returned to a more traditional \u201cMe Tarzan, You Jane\u201d set-up. Knight\u2019s script possesses an equally tiresome view of the lockdown, painted as an annoyance rather than a necessary safety measure (described as \u201cidiotic\u201d and \u201cinsane\u201d during one of many unbearable monologues) and the film never once seems to take any notice of the damage inflicted by the virus, just how bored it makes our central duo. Their boredom is made even more exhausting when coupled with their extreme privilege, both holed up in a luxurious multi-level house in an affluent borough as the world crashes around them. There are many, many misfiring attempts at comedy (isn\u2019t Zoom annoying lol etc) but no joke lands with quite as much of a thud as Ejiofor\u2019s driver being forced to use the fake name of Edgar Allen Poe while being convinced that security guards would be too uneducated to know who that is. It\u2019s a recurring gag that\u2019s as snobby as it is dreadfully unfunny and like much of the surrounding film it leaves a sour, unpleasant taste that lingers. Rather than just providing us with a serviceable caper, Knight ambitiously aims for profundity instead, a decision that kills his limp film at birth (\u201cEven before the fucking virus we were all locked down in our own routines\u201d is the level of insight we\u2019re left with). It\u2019s a moronic script written as if it\u2019s actually incredibly smart, leading to the worst kind of bad movie, reaching for the stars but tripping over itself before it can even stand up. My advice for surviving 2021 is simple: wear a mask, wash your hands and please, please keep your distance from Locked Down.

Now, with an end to the lockdowns in sight, the measures have proved so successful that cities across Europe are betting on the bicycle to lead the recovery. According to the European Cyclists\u2019 Federation (ECF), the continent\u2019s cities spent \u20ac1bn on Covid-related cycling measures in 2020, creating at least 600 miles (1,000km) of cycle lanes, traffic-calming measures and car-free streets. What\u2019s more, it was not just the usual suspects in Denmark and the Netherlands taking action, but places with inadequate infrastructure. The pandemic revealed a latent demand for cycling and walking infrastructure and offered a chance to \u201cbuild back better\u201d, as politicians are fond of saying. Now many cities are busy accelerating existing plans to do just that. The ECF\u2019s Aleksander Buczy\u0144ski said: \u201cI think to a large degree the pandemic only accelerated some processes \u2026 The cities that made good provisional cycle paths were generally positively accepted by the inhabitants, if not uniformly.\u201d In Barcelona during the pandemic, public transport use fell by 50% and private car use by just 10%. In a city where many people own cars they previously used only at weekends, this was a congestion disaster waiting to happen.   Related: Two-way street: how Barcelona is democratising public space    An initial 13 miles of pop-up cycle lanes were installed in summer 2020 to plug holes in the cycle network and encourage people avoiding public transport to cycle, and four more miles are being added. Cycle use has now risen to 10% above pre-pandemic levels. Barcelona officials are accelerating the construction of 100 miles of new or improved cycle routes, increasing the network to 190 miles by 2024. This also prepares the ground for the Superblocks programme, of which cycle routes are an essential element and part of targets to cut car use by 25% by 2024. Milan\u2019s Strade Aperte programme was launched in April 2020 with a proposed 22 miles of new protected cycle lanes and pedestrian priority areas. The cycle route on Corso Buenos Aires is now the busiest in town, used by as many as 10,000 cyclists a day, an increase of 122% in a few months. Milan has now expanded Strade Aperte to 42 miles and is aiming for 62 miles by this summer. In Paris, streets once dominated by cars are filled with cycles. Since spring 2020, cycling is estimated to have grown by 70%, and 31 miles of temporary coronapistes installed early in the crisis are to be made permanent, with more added. The proportion of women cycling has grown, and a recent survey found 62% of residents wanted the lanes made permanent.     A bike lane in Paris in January. Photograph: Jacques Witt/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock    After re-election last year, the mayor, Anne Hidalgo, is accelerating cycleway plans further. According to ECF, Paris has delivered 100 miles of a planned 200 miles of new routes. Lisbon is in the process of almost doubling its 65-mile cycle network to 124 miles this year, starting with pop-up lanes to create new protected routes. In common with Barcelona, this is part of longer-term plans to increase walking and cycling, tackle air pollution and reduce the impact of heatwaves, with accompanying measures to increase street shade. Expanded 30km/h zones, pedestrianised zones, cycle parking and greenery are also part of the picture. In a year, cycling has grown by 25% and the proportion of women cycling has also increased.     A Lisbon bike lane. Photograph: Hugo Amaral/Sopa Images/Rex/Shutterstock    In a survey spanning 21 European cities, 64% of respondents said they did not want to return to pre-Covid air pollution levels, which are illegally high in many cities. Three-quarters were willing to reallocate public space from cars to active travel to achieve this, while 21% said they planned to cycle more after lockdown, and 35% planned to walk more. London has installed or started work on 62 miles of cycle routes since the start of the pandemic, and Transport for London data from January shows cycling has increased by 22% in outer London since 2019. Almost half of all journeys in London were made by cycling and walking from April to June 2020, up from 29% before the pandemic. Will Norman, London\u2019s walking and cycling commissioner, said: \u201cIt\u2019s vital we continue to build on this positive legacy from the pandemic rather than experiencing a car-led recovery, which would risk replacing one public health crisis with another air-quality-based one.\u201d Brussels trialled 37 miles of pop-up cycle routes in 2020, increasing \u201cactive cyclists\u201d by 87%, and Belgium is now looking to extend its cycle highway plans between towns and cities. The Flemish government upped the ante in March 2021 by announcing a \u20ac150m cycling package, taking its per head spend to \u20ac22 (\u00a319) a year \u2013 for comparison, the UK spends about \u00a37 per person.  Across Europe cycle tourism boomed, not least as travel restrictions limited further outings, and as part of its recovery Italy plans to invest in 630 miles of new urban and metropolitan cycle paths for transport and leisure, and 1,000 miles of tourist cycle paths. Krakow installed a handful of cycle paths that doubled cycling levels last summer, with many people switching from public transport to bikes. The city has now developed a five-year plan to expand the cycle network further. \u201cPeople say it took the Dutch or the Danish cities 30 or 50 years to build their cycle infrastructure, but we don\u2019t have this kind of time,\u201d said Buczy\u0144ski. \u201cWe have the climate emergency, which we cannot deal with in 50 years. We need to change the transport system pretty quickly, and it will be very difficult without making cycling a viable option for everyone. \u201cWe need to do it fast, maybe not in two months but in a few years.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe 'in urgent need of psychiatric support'", "full_article": " Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe \u201cis in urgent need of psychiatric support\u201d and has been the victim of torture, a report prepared by psychiatrists has found after examining her mental health. \nThe detained British-Iranian dual-national\u2019s healing \u201ccan be only provided in the UK in the presence of her family after reunification\u201d, the report says. \nThe 77-page report, prepared for the campaign group Redress, comes ahead of the Iranian authorities deciding on Sunday whether Zaghari-Ratcliffe should face a second set of charges.

Related: Coming 2 America is an unfunny disaster for representation | Kovie Biakolo    Apart from a few minor Twitter grumbles when it was announced at Comic-Con 2019 that Natalie Portman was to take on the role of Marvel\u2019s thunder god, there has been very little in the way of backlash \u2013 certainly nothing like the horrible behaviour dished out to Kelly Marie Tran for daring to sign up to Star Wars, or to Leslie Jones for appearing in the all-female Ghostbusters remake. Nor have the trolls really begun to target reports that acclaimed essayist and novelist Ta-Nehisi Coates will pen a new film about the man of steel for Warner Bros that is expected to feature a black version of Kal-El. That movie is being produced (and possibly directed) by JJ Abrams, though there are rumours the studio might be looking for a black director, too. With publicity beginning to ramp up for next year\u2019s Thor: Love &amp; Thunder, there\u2019s still time for negativity to surface, as the trolls get their teeth into Warner Bros\u2019s film. But right now, it seems there\u2019s only positivity flowing around both projects.     Ta-Nehisi Coates will write the script for Warner Bros\u2019 new Superman film. Photograph: Mary Altaffer/AP    Love &amp; Thunder will once again be directed by Taika Waititi, who did such an excellent job with Thor: Ragnarok. And the reality is that Thor has always been more interesting on the big screen when he\u2019s been out of sorts. The best moments in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s underrated original 2011 movie are those in which the arrogant young Thor gets cast out of Asgard by a beardy Anthony Hopkins to learn humility and the true meaning of heroism as an Earthbound mortal. He\u2019s also brilliant as a beer-gutted drunk in Avengers: Endgame. You can imagine the Marvel bods, while trying to dream up Thor\u2019s next adventure, seizing upon the recent comic book run in which Jane Foster becomes Thor as the perfect way to move the character on and avoid him reverting to the tedious cosmic princeling of Thor: The Dark World. It also helps when you have an actor of the calibre of Portman available. The black Superman concept \u2013 Michael B Jordan is a hot tip to star \u2013 also boasts a what\u2019s-not-to-like quality, especially if Warner Bros hires a director of colour. Coates boasts that rare combination of intellectual clout and geeky cool, as both the recipient of a 2015 \u201cgenius\u201d grant from the MacArthur foundation and a writer of Black Panther and Captain America comics for Marvel. The idea of a writer who specialises in examining both the African American experience and the evil legacy of white supremacy working on a superhero whose mantra is \u201ctruth, justice and the American way\u201d almost blows the mind. How would Kal-El\u2019s perspective on humanity shift if he found himself viewed through a racist prism of fear and suspicion by some of the very people he came all the way across the galaxy to help? At the very least, we can be sure he would spend a lot less time trying to date Lois and saving imperilled cats. The fact that movies like these are being met with enthusiasm should not signal that the dark side of the internet is dwindling. After all, we don\u2019t have to look too far back to find a time when blatant racism was something to be brushed under the carpet, rather than publicly called out. Only this week, Harry Potter star Katie Leung revealed that she faced online abuse after her role as Cho Chang was announced over a decade ago, even stumbling upon a \u201chate site\u201d directed at her. Leung told the Chinese Chippy Girl podcast she was told by publicists to deny the attacks were happening.     Leaps and bounds \u2026 Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Photograph: Landmark Media/Alamy Stock Photo    It would be nice to think that Leung\u2019s appearance as Potter\u2019s romantic interest helped boost the multicultural makeup of the world\u2019s fifth highest-grossing film franchise of all time. But it\u2019s also worth bearing in mind that if those movies had been made a decade later, an actor of colour might easily have been cast as one of the film\u2019s leads. That\u2019s a cultural shift that\u2019s already begun in superhero movies. When dealt with intelligently and creatively, shifts in the makeup of decades-old costumed crimefighters have only proved to make them more intriguing. Without the introduction of Miles Morales we would never have born witness to the Oscar-winning, psychedelic joy that was Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Few would argue that Samuel L Jackson makes a better Nick Fury than David Hasselhoff. Will Thor: Love &amp; Thunder and the black Superman movie end up helping to change racist and sexist attitudes?

Asked by state Greens upper house MP David Shoebridge whether he would look to reopen the investigation, Fuller said he was \u201cmore than happy to look into it\u201d. \u201cI know it\u2019s a matter of Australian significance,\u201d the police commissioner said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say here on the record that we\u2019re reopening the case but I\u2019m more than happy to talk to deputy commissioner, [David] Hudson, and then through the chain of command to ensure all the information has been properly assessed in terms of [deciding] that there\u2019s not enough admissible evidence to go forward.\u201d But while Fuller said he was \u201calways open to new investigations\u201d he cautioned that although it was not impossible to prosecute a sexual assault case without the alleged victim \u201cin reality it just wouldn\u2019t happen\u201d. A spokesman for Porter declined to comment on the Hooke statement, saying: \u201cAs noted at his press conference on 3 March, the attorney general is on medical leave. He does not propose to comment further.\u201d In his press conference, where he identified himself as the cabinet minister accused of a historical rape, Porter said he was first made aware of the claims at a dinner with a friend in November 2019. While maintaining specific allegations had not been put to him, and he did not read the letter or statement sent to Morrison by the woman\u2019s friends, Porter said he first became aware of \u201crumours\u201d last November. \u201cThere was a very old friend of mine, whom I had dinner with, and she had said to me that a group of people were spreading a rumour, that I had in some way offended against the person 33 years ago,\u201d he said.

Asked whether he had sought contact with her indirectly, Porter replied: \u201cNo.\u201d  Hooke said he had made himself known to NSW police after his friend\u2019s death. \u201cIn relation to any criminal prosecution, Christian Porter was manifestly and appropriately entitled to the presumption of innocence \u2013 it is essential to the rule of law,\u201d he said. \u201cIn relation to any investigation of the important non-criminal aspects of this matter, I support an inquiry, like either that conducted by three retired eminent judges after Justice Lionel Murphy was acquitted of charges, or that conducted by Dr Vivienne Thom into allegations about Justice Heydon. \u201cI am willing to testify under oath at any appropriately convened inquiry. \u201cWhile I fully support the freedom of the press, I do not believe the media is the optimal forum in which to investigate a situation of this sensitivity and significance.\u201d Another close friend of the woman who made the allegations, who had accompanied her to make a statement with New South Wales police in early 2020, had previously told Guardian Australia that Porter had dined with the woman \u201cin the 1990s\u201d.

Business and legal experts, including the former solicitor general Justin Gleeson, have said there would be no issue holding an independent inquiry.

The use of machine learning to shine a light on the scale of pollution from untreated effluent being spilled into rivers could be a crucial tool in efforts to improve the quality of rivers, a paper says. Prof Peter Hammond, visiting scientist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, who co-authored the paper published in the journal Clean Water, used artificial intelligence to analyse data from two unidentified water companies\u2019 waste treatment works from 2009 to 2018. The AI identified 926 \u201cdark discharges\u201d \u2013 or previously unknown spills \u2013 from the storm overflows at the two treatment plants. Discharges of untreated sewage from storm overflows, or CSOs, are permitted only in exceptional circumstances, such as extreme rainfall, the European commission has ruled. The spills identified by the AI included many during periods of unexceptional rainfall. Of these spills of untreated sewage, 360 discharged into rivers for a whole day, often spilling for more than 10 full days in a row. The impact of a full day of untreated sewage flowing into a river is particularly harmful, the authors said, because the spills involve the maximum flow of the most concentrated sewage, which creates the greatest risk of pollution. Such spills over several days were even more harmful. \u201cWorse still is the pollution potential caused by an unbroken series of 24-hr untreated sewage spills during which a receiving watercourse has no respite nor opportunity to recover,\u201d the paper said. Recent data from the Water Framework Directive shows the poor state of English rivers. Only 14% of English rivers are of good ecological standard, a rating that suggests they are as close to their natural state as possible. \u201cDepending on the characteristics of the receiving river and the weather, these [spills] might be highly impactful discharges,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt remains to be determined whether these \u2018dark\u2019 discharges could help to explain why 80% of surface water bodies in England are assigned a bad, poor or moderate status classification within the Water Framework Directive.\u201d Hammond said machine learning could be helpful for water companies, the Environment Agency and for scientists to help reduce pollution from sewage spills. \u201cOur objective was to develop techniques for analysing daily flow patterns and EDM data that could detect spills of untreated \u2018storm tank overflow\u2019 discharges into watercourses. We have shown that we can retrospectively identify spills or likely spills from the flow of the sewage being treated at the works,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can inform the water companies which of their works are not functioning properly and it could help the Environment Agency identify gaps in compliance with permits to discharge wastewater. It can also help citizen and professional scientists interested in sewage-related pollution of watercourses.\u201d The AI programme, the authors say, could be crucial to determining the scale of untreated sewage pouring into rivers because there remain many issues with the quality of the reported data. \u201cDespite considerable environmental regulation and environmental impact, there remain gaps in our knowledge of the frequency, volume, and polluting effects from untreated sewage spills,\u201d the authors said. One continuous spill of 60 days detected by the machine learning approach resulted in sewage fungus, which was also reported by members of the public. Water companies self-report on sewage pollution incidents to the Environment Agency but there is acknowledged underreporting. Many pollution spills are reported by watchful members of the public. In 2018, water companies reported 62% of pollution incidents, while the public reported 38% \u2013 nearly 400 incidents.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Hemiandrus jacinda: insect named after New Zealand prime minister", "full_article": "New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has received what may be her greatest accolade yet: a large insect named in her honour. A new species of w\u0113t\u0101 \u2013 a giant flightless cricket that is endemic to New Zealand \u2013 has been named Hemiandrus jacinda for being Labour-party red in colour and \u201clong-limbed\u201d. Steven Trewick, a professor in evolutionary ecology at Massey University in New Zealand and the scientist who named and formally described the insect, said it had struck him for \u201creflecting traits of the prime minister\u201d. It was a \u201cstriking species\u201d, he said, and he considered it beautiful. The prime minister\u2019s office said Ardern was \u201caware of this and very honoured\u201d. A spokesperson added: \u201cA beetle and a lichen, along with an ant in Saudi Arabia, have also been named after her.\u201d More than 100 different species of w\u0113t\u0101 are found in trees, caves, bush and sometimes suburban gardens. As with all members of the Hemiandrus group, jacinda makes burrows in the ground, from which it emerges to hunt at night. The newly discovered species is bigger and more brightly coloured than the 17 ground w\u0113t\u0101 already recorded, and found in native forests in Northland, Bay of Plenty, Waikato and Coromandel in the upper North Island. It was described in the Zootaxa journal for the first time on Friday as \u201ccomparatively large, long-limbed, glossy and predominantly orange-red\u201d. Trewick said it was remarkable that jacinda had evaded recognition until now, given that it had been found close to densely populated areas and that it was \u201cnot a small, cryptic beast but a hefty insect with flamboyant colouring\u201d. It was proof that \u201cin a time of accelerating environmental change, loss of natural habitat and global precipitous decline of the planet\u2019s biological diversity, the work of species discovery continues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe w\u0113t\u0101 of New Zealand are a rich and diverse radiation of species living in all sorts of habitats \u2013 yet many remain to be recognised.\u201d But just as jacinda had been discovered, Trewick warned it was likely to be already declining in abundance on the slide towards extinction. W\u0113t\u0101 are threatened by introduced predators such as rats and cats, and habitat loss and modification such as farmland. A key feature of the Department of Conservation\u2019s work to conserve w\u0113t\u0101 is to classify them, with significant variation between the species despite their genetic similarity and large gaps in the knowledge of their distribution, abundance and ecology. It highlighted yet another commonality between the big cricket and the prime minister, said Trewick: \u201cBoth matter to New Zealand a great deal.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Gazelle Twin & NYX: Deep England review | John Lewis's contemporary album of the month ", "full_article": "Gazelle Twin is the alter ego of Elizabeth Bernholz, a composer, producer and singer who creates unsettling, terrifying and occasional hilarious electronic music. Her stage costume resembles a Morris-dancing Leigh Bowery in Adidas trainers impersonating one of the droogs from Clockwork Orange. This retro-futurist court jester garb suited her remarkable 2018 album Pastoral, a febrile journey into the heart of middle England that mixed thuggish techno, menacing folk chants and lyrics that satirised old Albion and delved into its dark, paganistic roots.     Gazelle Twin &amp; NYX: Deep England album cover Photograph: Publicity image    The album has had something of an afterlife: it was revived at the London jazz festival in 2019 as a semi-staged choral project, featuring Bernholz and the six-piece drone choir NYX, and has now been rerecorded as Deep England. Several tracks from Pastoral are radically reworked to become drum-free, drone-filled immersive soundscapes. Better in My Day, a study in nostalgic bigotry, is made creepier by replacing the thumping beats of the original with heavy breathing and rhythmic grunts. Fire Leap is a version of that spooky playground chant from The Wicker Man, accompanied by a demented perpetual canon played on two recorders.The voices of Bernholz and the women of NYX are digitally pitch-shifted to create freakishly low bass-baritone growls, as on Deep England, where they evoke a Gregorian chant choir. Throne is a nightmarish babble of watery effects that sounds like a ritualistic sacrifice by drowning; even more terrifying is Golden Dawn, which conjures images of a medieval basso profundo singing a threnody for England in a decommissioned power station, accompanied by electronic bleeps that sound like amplified water drips, and a microtonal choir put through endless layers of reverb.

The city was in flux: riots and gang battles sometimes shut down entire streets. Bombs went off on buses and in crowded spaces. Newspapers carried daily updates of the number of casualties. Wealthier homes and cafes were protected by security guards with metal detectors and AK-47s. Shackle stayed with her aunt in a safer \u2013 more affluent \u2013 neighbourhood. She grew used, as she writes, \u201cto experiencing Karachi from the windows of a car\u201d. Things were once different. In the 1960s and 70s, the city was a stopover on the hippie trail to India and Nepal. Tourists sunned themselves on its spotless beaches and partied in its casinos and nightclubs. A swelling population of partition-era refugees and Pashtun migrants ensured cheap labour that fuelled a period of economic growth. \u201cHashish was easily available,\u201d the Pakistani journalist Nadeem F Paracha once wrote about those years, \u201cbut people still didn\u2019t know what heroin or a Kalashnikov was\u201d. Shackle, too, was lured in by the contradictions enmeshed in the city\u2019s charm and danger. By the time she arrived in 2012, political parties and public officials had for decades been running a parallel economy with crime syndicates. Replenished by American and Saudi aid during the presidency of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the city\u2019s affluent classes flourished, even as newer migrants, fleeing calamities elsewhere, were trapped in a cycle of diminishing resources and ethnic violence. Power cuts were frequent. Water had to be delivered in tankers. Mangroves and villages were lost to real estate projects. In Karachi Vice, Shackle tells the stories of five residents, carefully chosen to reflect different sides of the shadow city. There is Zille, a crime reporter who courts cops and mobsters alike for his scoops. A school teacher in a violent neighbourhood can only watch as her friends and family succumb to an influential ganglord. A Pashtun ambulance driver and a mohajir (a Muslim immigrant from India) surveyor are both driven by a wish to improve their lives. Then there is Jannat, whose ancestral village is being swallowed up by a murky private township near Karachi. Shackle excels at drawing out the incisive quote. Jannat is circumspect about the possibility of having to abandon her home. \u201cYou have to do these things,\u201d she tells Shackle. \u201cFor your children.\u201d Safdar, the ambulance driver, struggles to process the trauma of rescuing bodies from blast sites: \u201cI don\u2019t dwell on my memories. Memories are a prison.\u201d Parveen, the teacher, can\u2019t recall the good times in her neighbourhood. She doesn\u2019t have to explain her reasons: \u201cThey snatched all the happiness from us.\u201d But the book\u2019s triumph is Zille, the one character whose motives aren\u2019t always transparent. Shackle can never quite pin him down \u2013 he lies to her three times about his age \u2013 and yet the city comes to life through his eyes. His career overlaps with the gang wars that broke out at the turn of the millennium and the 2013 \u201cKarachi Operation\u201d approved by a newly elected Nawaz Sharif to weed out crime in the city. When a group of Taliban gunmen stormed into the city\u2019s airport in June 2014, Zille sneaked inside during the siege to relay live updates. He ended up on the militants\u2019 radar. \u201cWhen you are on a terrorist hit list,\u201d he tells Shackle, \u201ceverybody knows that you\u2019re a real journalist.\u201d The ordeals faced by Shackle\u2019s protagonists seem to suit the powers that be just fine: behind the cover of violence and ethnic conflict there is good money to be made. Shackle is reluctant to insert herself into the narrative, but she is surely part of Karachi\u2019s story, since her mother was born and brought up there. How does she herself perceive the city? In recent years, the city\u2019s position in the World Crime Index has improved. On the face of it, the Karachi Operation would seem to have succeeded. But Shackle reveals horrifying instances of young men, some of them teenagers, who have disappeared after being picked up for questioning during the crackdown. Their families hang around funeral homes, searching for unidentified corpses. The nexus of crime, politics and business at the centre of the violence is still in place. Many gangs and militias have merely moved their kingpins out of the city. Work continues apace on the private township that threatens Jannat\u2019s village. Farmlands and settlements are being razed to build a gated banlieue with \u201cworld-class\u201d amenities.

It\u2019s a question you might not have considered before. Perhaps it\u2019s never bothered you. The topic of what makes us who we are, and our sense of self, has been discussed since the origins of western philosophy. The central theme in some of the world\u2019s most famous novels, such as Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u2019s Jane Eyre, Charles Dickens\u2019 Great Expectations and JK Rowling\u2019s Harry Potter is one of identity and the search for self. Yet defining who we are proves notoriously tricky. Some may think identity as being forged through seminal moments \u2013 the birth of a child; perhaps a marriage. Many people see a personal identity as correlating with their ethnicity, nationality, or racial background.  The sociologist Stuart Hall believed that cultural identities are subject to change, and belong \u201cto the future as much as to the past\u201d. Cultural identities originate from somewhere, they have histories, he said. But how do you identify if you are misled about your own history? Or when your view of yourself does not match up with how others see you? I examine all this in my book, Raceless, which traces my attempts to piece together the truth about my heritage. I was told by both parents that I was white, but in my early 20s discovered my biological father was black. In researching this, which also involved a podcast series, The Secrets in Us, I also discovered the stories of many others who were misled about their personal identities. After years of believing my own story to be utterly bizarre, it was oddly reassuring to draw points of reference from others around the world. There was the mixed-race girl in her 20s from Florida who, like me, was raised to believe she was the child of two white parents. Both of us confirmed our black parentage from ancestral DNA testing. There was the Welshman, also mixed-race, who was passed off as fully white by his white mother, who raised him alone. In a cruel twist of fate, just before he tracked down his black family in London, vitiligo robbed him of his phenotypical blackness and he now passes as a white man. Then there was the London-based businessman in his 40s who contacted me to share a story almost identical to my own: his blackness was ignored by his parents because, he later found out, his mother had had an affair with a black man in Paris. I interviewed the musician Shovell, of the band M People, who was always told that his white parents had adopted him. Although he identified as black, the truth later emerged that the woman who had raised him was, in fact, his biological mother. I also found there to be parallels of racial or cultural erasure between my experiences and that of some Nigerian-born children fostered by white families. Each of these stories is deeply layered and complex, yet they all centre around the control of a child\u2019s identity to ensure the comfort of the parents. In many cases blackness was only accepted if it was overlooked: tolerated but not celebrated. Shame also played a huge role \u2013 shame around a child\u2019s difference, shame in relation to a woman\u2019s extramarital affair. And shame around who you are can often manifest itself in self-inflicted abuse of the body. My own teenage years were marred by an eating disorder. Loving, affectionate relationships with white caregivers can be pushed to breaking point when it emerges that the child\u2019s cultural background or parentage has been obscured from them. The psychological impact of discovering deception of this kind is massive: people told me they felt furious at being robbed of a key part of their identity. The process of rebuilding and re-deciphering their story after a lifetime of believing it to be something else was hugely destabilising: depression, PTSD and grief were common. As Shovell told me: \u201cI was deeply, deeply, deeply scarred. Immediately. PTSD doesn\u2019t only happen to soldiers on a battlefield.\u201d In hearing so many stories like this, it has become clear to me that withholding information that is fundamental to a child\u2019s self-development is a cruel form of identity erasure, warping realities and often leaving emotional scars that take years to heal. I don\u2019t believe that black children raised within white homes have to endure pain and suffering. A transracial home does not need to be a synonym for trauma if it is a place of openness and honest dialogue; from my experience I would say that imbuing a child with a sense of pride around all aspects of their identity is key. Ensuring they are surrounded by \u201cracial mirrors\u201d (successful role models who look like them) will help raise their aspirations. Discussing and celebrating difference when children start to notice it will lead to positive associations. What is absolutely the wrong approach is the colour-blind one. Accepting racial difference only by pretending not to see it keeps families separate and distant. It stilts relationships and creates a damaging silence around who the child really is. When lies are at the heart of the home, it is impossible for children to trust their caregivers, and sometimes other people too. They can grow up believing there is something unspeakably wrong with them. Love is not enough, I know this from experience. It is up to parents to ensure their children are not left to decipher race, and what it means for them, on their own.

On International Women\u2019s Day she posted a video to her Instagram of a nervous looking young Bronze, on a windy pitch, turning towards the camera with knuckles held close to her face, then it cuts to her having a chance on goal. \u201cMy mum\u2019s been pulling out a few videos and pictures recently and on these things you can just see the awkwardness on my face. It\u2019s quite funny to see how I\u2019ve grown. I\u2019ve grown a lot over the years and it\u2019s nice to see that change.\u201d   Related: FA sorry for telling players of Olympic omission 90 minutes before game    Interestingly, in the newly announced Team GB manager Hege Riise, a former World Cup, European and Olympic champion, Bronze has found a manager who seems to understand that more reserved side. \u201cI like Hege,\u201d says Bronze. \u201cHege and [the assistant manager] Rhian [Wilkinson], they work together like Batman and Robin, it\u2019s quite interesting how the two personalities mash together because they\u2019re so different.\u201d Riise and Wilkinson spent time with each player during England\u2019s February camp, their first, to learn more about them and in Riise Bronze found a kindred spirit. \u201cI was talking to Hege about what kind of person I am and she just laughed,\u201d says Bronze with a grin. \u201cI was like: \u2018Oh, you know, the Covid restrictions are hard but I enjoy being by myself, I like being in a room, I like been focused, I like to train.

I\u2019ve got a coach that must have been the same sort of player.\u2019 \u201cIn the past, not with Phil [Neville] or anything, I think I\u2019ve been misunderstood or it\u2019s taken a while for coaches to really understand the person that I am, because I\u2019m just a little bit different to the other girls. Straightaway, she said: \u2018No, Lucy, I understand\u2019 and I was like: \u2018That is music to my ears\u2019.\u201d In England\u2019s 6-0 friendly victory over Northern Ireland during that camp, Bronze looked like a player on a mission and finished the game with two assists and a goal. \u201cPlaying for England at the minute is enjoyable,\u201d she says. \u201cThe new coaches have given me a pretty free rein, which is probably why I got two assists and a goal because they said we know what we can get from you, you go and do you.\u201d That game was sandwiched by impressive performances for Manchester City, including the opening goal in a 3-0 derby win against United, that earned Bronze the Barclays WSL player of the month award for February. She rejoined City from European champions Lyon last summer to be closer to the England team and at City she plays with a host of her international teammates.

I\u2019ve had a bigger impact on things than probably what I did this time last year, even though we\u2019ve had Covid, which has obviously limited a lot of things with camps or games or interactions with people.\u201d One player benefiting from having the world\u2019s best full-back behind her is the 23-year-old forward Chloe Kelly. Their relationship is looking increasingly instinctive. \u201cComing from Everton, Chloe was heavily relied on for goals, for assisting goals, making goals, scoring goals,\u201d Bronze says. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s been good her to come to a team where she could maybe relax a little bit more, the pressure\u2019s not on her. She\u2019s still so young. At the start of the season I was like: \u2018Chloe, you do know you can pass to me? I can do these things, too.\u2019 \u201cAs the season has gone on, particularly most recently, our relationship has developed and we\u2019re starting to create movements together, create goals together and it\u2019s not just one of us doing it on our own.\u201d   Related: Manchester City Women thrash Fiorentina to reach quarter-finals    The mentoring role is still new to Bronze, but she is increasingly enjoying it: \u201cA couple of years ago I probably felt a little bit like I wasn\u2019t really a senior member of the teams that I was playing in. Over the past two years that\u2019s kind of changed. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of players who come to me now and ask me questions. It took a while for it to click in my head and think that they\u2019re asking me questions because they really look up to me or they think I\u2019ve got the answers or I\u2019ve got the experience. Once that clicked in my head I\u2019ve enjoyed it. Obviously Chloe and Lauren Hemp, at City, I get on well with Lauren James, and when she was at England, she was texting me every day like: \u2018Lucy can we have a chat. I want to do this, I want to do that, what should I want to do?\u2019 The great thing is is that they\u2019re all hungry to learn and if you want to ask questions, I\u2019m open to helping anyone and answering because I want England and I want English players to improve and be the best in the world as well.\u201d Is Bronze back to her best after niggles that affected her return at City? \u201cNot yet, no,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m getting better, settling in better. I\u2019m just fixing a few things with my body at the moment, but I\u2019m definitely improving as the season goes on.

In January 2020, ex-senior public servant David Tune handed the federal government an internal review of the function and efficiency of the National Archives of Australia. The government has sat on the report since then, and has resisted making it public, despite freedom of information requests from independent senator Rex Patrick.   Related: John Kerr's letters to the Queen's private secretary: 'A raw display of devastation'    The NAA released the review late Friday afternoon, following the Guardian asking questions about it earlier on Friday. The report made several startling findings. It found the NAA was \u201cstruggling\u201d to meet its mandate \u201cto secure, preserve and make public, the archival resources of the Commonwealth\u201d. \u201cIn particular, the National Archives has struggled to fulfil its mandate and to invest in the systems it needs in the digital age to meet this mandate,\u201d the report said. \u201cResources are needed to invest in contemporary technologies that will meet the volume of digital transfer, preservation, storage, declassification, and public access required under the Act.\u201d The review noted the NAA has been defunded and starved of resources. The strain on resources has harmed its service delivery and led to redundancies. \u201cAs observed in recent independent audits, this has impacted the National Archives service delivery to both government and the Australian public.\u201d The report identified an immediate and pressing concern: that the NAA is allowing the \u201cdeterioration of many records\u201d that it holds. This, it found, was a potential breach of the Archives Act. \u201cLimited capacity in the Archives means that many records (in a variety of forms) will be lost if action is not taken. As such, the National Archives could potentially be in breach of Part 5 Section 24 of the Act due to unauthorised loss of records.\u201d The report said the NAA was also failing to respond to \u201crequests for records within the period defined in the Act\u201d. \u201cLong response times were highlighted in many public submissions to this review and have also attracted media attention for some time,\u201d the review said. \u201cPart of this criticism relates to the time taken by the National Archives to obtain advice from other agencies (particularly for security related and other sensitive records) before it can take decisions on whether to declassify records and release them.\u201d   Related: National archives' 90-day delay to declassify palace letters 'extremely disappointing'    The report was finally released publicly after it was provided to Patrick through FoI. The independent senator said the FoI should not have been necessary. \u201cIt is unfortunate that it was necessary to have to resort to an FoI application to secure the release of a major report on the principal institution responsible for safeguarding and making available to the public the historical records of the Australian Government,\u201d he said. \u201cMr Tune\u2019s report should have been published as soon as it was submitted to the government.\u201d Patrick said it was \u201cworrying\u201d to read that the deterioration of records required immediate action. \u201cThe National Archives is charged with responsibility for safeguarding what are national treasures; documents that tell our nation\u2019s history \u2013 from big political decisions down to the service records of individual Defence Force personnel or the immigration files of the millions of people who have come from overseas to make Australia their home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe vast and fragile photographic collections of the National Archives are a unique and irreplaceable part of our nation\u2019s visual history.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worrying, therefore, to read Mr Tune\u2019s assessment that the deterioration of many records held in the Archives requires immediate action.\u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Israel 'bombed a dozen ships carrying Iranian oil or weapons in past two years'", "full_article": "Israel has bombed at least a dozen ships en route to Syria in the past two years, most of which have been carrying Iranian oil, the Wall Street Journal has reported, citing US and regional officials. The attacks, which the article said included water mines in the Red Sea and other areas of the region, would, if confirmed, suggest a new front in the semi-covert conflict between arch-foes Israel and Iran. Israel has conducted hundreds of aerial bombings against Iranian forces and their allies in neighbouring Syria, but it has not indicated if it has also been conducting strikes at sea. Officials do not usually comment on alleged military action and did not confirm or deny the Wall Street Journal claims. Some of the naval attacks blocked Iranian efforts to move weaponry in the region, the US media outlet reported. Oil shipments were targeted \u201cout of concern that petroleum profits are funding extremism in the Middle East\u201d. The strikes did not sink any tankers but forced at least two to return to port in Iran, it added. Iran did not immediately comment on the report. The revelations follow two recent incidents involving tankers that have raised tensions between the two countries. First was a blast on an Israeli-owned ship, the Helios Ray, in the Gulf of Oman last month. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, blamed the explosion on Iran, saying: \u201cIran is the greatest enemy of Israel. I am determined to halt it. We are hitting it in the entire region.\u201d Iran denied the claim. Second, Israel announced that a recent tar spill that ravaged its shores was caused by a tanker carrying Iranian oil bound for Syria. Beachgoers and cleanup crews have found baby turtles and fish covered in black sludge. The Israeli environmental protection minister, Gila Gamliel, went as far as to suggest the incident was intentional, calling it a form of \u201cenvironmental terrorism\u201d. However, that claim was widely rebuffed by other officials, who said it was a leak. There was no suggestion or evidence that the tanker may have been hit by one of the alleged Israeli strikes reported by the Wall Street Journal. Iranian state TV separately reported on Friday that an Iranian cargo vessel was targeted this week in a \u201cterrorist attack\u201d in the Mediterranean. There were no casualties in the explosion, the report said. The report quoted Ali Ghiasian, a spokesperson for the state shipping line, as saying that Wednesday\u2019s attack damaged Shahr-e Kord, a commercial vessel travelling to Europe. Ghiasian said an \u201cexplosives device\u201d damaged the hull of the ship and set off a small fire that was quickly extinguished. The report said the ship would continue on its path following a damage assessment, without providing more details. It did not blame anyone for the alleged attack.  Israel often coordinates its military activities with the US, or at least informs its key ally. However, the country is concerned that the new administration in Washington will take a softer approach on Iran than that of Donald Trump. Joe Biden has plans to resurrect a US-Iran nuclear deal that is opposed by Israel as it considers Iran to be an uncooperative \u201cterrorist regime\u201d. Meanwhile, officials in Iran have accused Israel of \u201cmilitary adventurism\u201d, and Tehran alleged that its enemy assassinated its top nuclear scientist last year, a claim Israel denies.

The Grammys, like most things in the Covid era, will be different this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be in a pandemic, pregnant, among social unrest. It definitely played out a lot different in my mind, you know?\u201d Guyton is the first Black solo female artist to be nominated in a Grammy country category, for her single Black Like Me; the only previous Black women to be nominated for country music were the Pointer Sisters in 1976. She says she never pictured making history with a song that details the Black experience in an exclusionary genre, or that she would pivot from trying to keep quiet and compliant to being at the forefront of a movement to crack country open to new voices. But now, she says, \u201cthe boat has been rocked\u201d. As Guyton sings on her 2015 release Better Than You Left Me, a track that should have been a hit if American country radio were not so committed to moderately talented white men as its bread and butter, \u201cit\u2019s funny what a little time does, baby\u201d. Hailing from Arlington, the same Texan town as the country superstar Maren Morris, and growing up inspired by LeAnn Rimes, Dolly Parton and the (formerly Dixie) Chicks, Guyton has a voice that can match Carrie Underwood in range and power but which simmers in its own unique and warm twang. She writes intimate ballads as well as the saccharine stuff that genre fans love to hear blasting out while sprawled out with a beer at a festival. But while country music has been fighting to correct the dismal female representation on the radio, Guyton has been left out of a battle that only seemed to include white women. \u201cI felt like I was the forgotten one,\u201d she says.              She moved to country music\u2019s capital, Nashville, but her career stalled even as she kept writing songs such as Black Like Me and What Are You Gonna Tell Her?, a stunning mediation on the disappointments and broken promises of womanhood. Both appear on her Bridges EP, alongside the poppy and delightful Ros\u00e9. Guyton crafted Black Like Me a few years ago, with the murder of Botham Jean, an innocent Black man shot in his home, heavy on her heart and mind. \u201cI circled it around to certain people I trusted in the industry that I knew who had the power to help,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the response was like: \u2018Wow, this is really powerful. But I need to sit with it for a minute.\u2019\u201d    In order for there to be change in country music, there needs to be such a surge of other types of artists  Mickey Guyton     Its moment eventually came amid the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020. As all great county lyrics do, its central chorus line \u2013 \u201cIf you think we live in the land of the free / You should try to be black like me\u201d \u2013 spoke on both a universal and a granular level: to a country in the midst of a racial reckoning, and to a musical genre born from Black traditions that has long denied its origin story. Suddenly Guyton found herself in a new, sometimes reluctant position as an activist. \u201c[Black Like Me] is so much bigger than my own personal experiences,\u201d Guyton says. \u201cAnd realising I have to open this little window and bust it open for not only women of colour, but the gay community as well. In order for there to be change in country music, there needs to be such a surge of other types of artists who aren\u2019t just white and male.\u201d     Another country \u2026 Guyton on stage in Arrington, Tennessee for the 2020 CMT awards.

Guyton has also made it a priority to promote other Black women in the genre, but she has wondered whether, in the process, she has been \u201cleading them into the lion\u2019s den\u201d. Even with a Grammy nomination, she still wasn\u2019t getting played on country radio. And after the insurrection at the US Capitol, and country megastar Morgan Wallen being caught on tape saying a racial slur, she found herself crying to her husband, wondering if she was doing the right thing. \u201cI\u2019ve been putting my neck on the line, saying you can sing country music and be accepted,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was a part of me that was also like: but can you? I\u2019ve encouraged so many amazing, talented, beautiful people. But I want to protect the people I am leading into this, too.\u201d That means speaking out as much as she can, even when it gets uncomfortable. Messages to her on Twitter can be filled with hate and racism, showing how country music can be both a beautiful and deeply broken place. \u201cIt\u2019s making some people very angry,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we\u2019re waking up.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Chess: Magnus Carlsen to face Alireza Firouzja as No 1 battles dip in form", "full_article": "The 10-tournament online $1.5m Meltwater Champions Tour resumes on Saturday at 4pm, free and live online, with the $200,000 Magnus Carlsen Invitational, and another testing day for the below par world No 1.

Bobby Fischer and His World by John Donaldson (Siles Press, 644 pages, \u00a326) and Vasily Smyslov: The Early Years 1921-1948 by Andrey Terekhov (Russell Enterprises, 556 pages, \u00a333) are highly readable books based on impressive research, and both highlight such critical moments. Donaldson claims that Fischer\u2019s quantum jump from age 12, when he was an also-ran in the bottom half of the US Junior and US Amateur, to age 13 when he played his famous Game of the Century, is the fastest ever improvement for a high level player. In current rating terms Fischer advanced around 700 points, from 1700 to 2400, in around 12-15 months. One secret was his concentrated high-class activity, both as a player and as a student of the game. Fischer was exceptionally elected to membership of New York\u2019s prestigious Manhattan Club. where the normal age limit was 18. He played incessant five-minute blitz against strong opponents, and he even acquired international experience on a high board for the Log Cabin club\u2019s visit to Cuba. At that time professional players in Britain and Western Europe were preparing openings with the aid of Chess Archives, edited by Euwe in the Netherlands, and were starting to add Soviet publications like Schachmatny Bulletin for up-to-date theory. Fischer knew them both, taught himself sufficient Russian to understand tournament bulletins from Moscow, and absorbed it all with his fast and accurate memory. By mid-1956 he had advanced from the bottom half of the US Junior to winning it with a near-maximum score, and was already finishing high up in the US Open. Donaldson analyses and chronicles both Bobby\u2019s rise and his later fall as his anti-semitic fixation took over his life.   Related: Chess: US giants fail as Grenke Bank win first World Corporate Championship    Smyslov also had an unusual career start. He was coached by his father, a strong master who had once defeated the legendary Alexander Alekhine in a tournament, and only began play outside his family at 14. There was a lucky break at 18, when he was called up for military service in 1940 during the Soviet invasion of Finland and rejected due to poor eyesight. That may have led, decades later, to his habit of peering at the board, then making a move to a new square with an individualistic screwing motion. Smyslov had luck, too, in the mid-1940s when he had rivals in the race to become No 2 in the USSR behind Mikhail Botvinnik. Soviet officials wanted reliable team players, so were impressed when Smyslov scored 7.5/8 in the radio and over-the-board matches against the US and Britain in 1945-47, helped by a critical time pressure moment in his second game against Samuel Reshevsky, who blundered by 39 Ne4?? when 39 Nb7!

Four blue shirts flitted forward downcourt, outnumbering Orlando\u2019s lone defender, until Luka Don\u010di\u0107 collected the ball inches from the rim. The best young baller in the world had a simple lay-up before him, but passed it up for the spectacular play: attempting a backwards, no-look bounce pass to where he thought Maximillian Kleber would be arriving. Kleber, however, had stopped running and the pass found no one at all. Within 30 seconds, the lead would shrink to seven points. For some athletes, the indignity of such an elementary mistake might make them think twice before attempting the same thing again. But that is not how Luka Don\u010di\u0107 plays basketball. In his short time in the NBA, one of his shining qualities is his audacity. He goes about his work with joy and deep conviction in his ability, which translates to him being unafraid of expressing his talent to the fullest with the most difficult, outrageous passes and shot attempts. A few minutes into the fourth quarter, he rectified his mistake with an identical pass, this time with the added difficulty of being airbound. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly talking to players about not jumping in the air and trying to make decisions,\u201d Dallas coach Rick Carlisle said afterwards, laughing. \u201cI mean, this guy defies a lot of logic when it comes to conventional coaching theories.   Luka Doncic   \u201cThat\u2019s why we give him the ball and let him go.\u201d For the past two and a half seasons, watching Don\u010di\u0107 take the ball and go has become one of the most exhilarating sights in sports. He is 6ft 7in with a sturdy frame, but his talents are delicate and pure. He uses his court sense and bottomless toolbox of trickery to humiliate defenders and executes passes that most cannot even see in their dreams. Despite using the ball for so many of the Mavericks\u2019 possessions and deciding the final minutes of most games himself, he is paradoxically unselfish, constantly seeking out teammates and making their lives easier by creating space for them. Since his arrival on US soil in 2018, coaches and pundits have frequently described Don\u010di\u0107 as playing the game at his own pace. He does, but sometimes the implication is that his guile makes up for his complete dearth of athleticism. Don\u010di\u0107 is some distance from the optimum shape he may one day achieve, but his footwork, agility and the sheer control he has over his body as he drives into the paint to beat his man, accelerating and decelerating at will, is a supreme athletic feat in itself. The starting point for Doncic\u2019s 2020-21 season truly came six months ago in the Disney World bubble when his vicious bullying of quality teams culminated in the masterpiece of his NBA career so far: a 43-point, 17-rebound, 13-assist eruption against the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 4 of the Western Conference quarter-finals, a manic display punctuated with a game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer. After two years of filling up the stat sheet for a team that generally draws a fraction of the attention as the NBA\u2019s coastal goliaths, this was the moment his name burst into the stratosphere. He is now a two-time All-Star starter, a member of last year\u2019s All-NBA first team and, on Wednesday, logged his 33rd career triple-double, landing him joint 11th on the all-time list at just 22 years old. He is also now the undeniable leader of the Mavericks. By the start of this season, he was being tabbed as an early MVP favorite. Things have not exactly gone to plan. Don\u010di\u0107 was caught out by the decision to start the new season in November and entered it out of shape. His first step was slower, his three-pointer \u201ccouldn\u2019t make it in the pool\u201d, in his words. As he quickly worked back to step, the team itself collapsed. Four key players \u2013 Jalen Brunson, Josh Richardson, Kleber and Dorian Finney-Smith \u2013 were sidelined due to Covid protocols, while Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is struggled with his form and movement on his return from meniscus surgery. By the first week of February, Dallas were 14th of 15 teams in the Western Conference standings and on a six-game losing streak that dropped their record to 9-14. This was all an unfamiliar feeling for Don\u010di\u0107. Throughout his career, he has always been a winner. He was crowned EuroLeague MVP for Real Madrid at 19, and was a leading contributor in Slovenia\u2019s EuroBasket victory the year before, following a youth spent mercilessly battering his contemporaries in Ljubljana. After a blowout loss to Utah Jazz at the end of January, he sounded helpless. \u201cTerrible,\u201d he said. \u201cI never felt like this. We\u2019ve got to do something, because this is not looking good. We\u2019ve got to step up and just talk to each other and play way better than this. It\u2019s mostly effort.\u201d     Luka Don\u010di\u0107 drives to the basket during the first half of a February game against the Hawks at Atlanta\u2019s State Farm Arena. Photograph: Todd Kirkland/Getty Images    The struggles have presented Don\u010di\u0107 in a different light on and off the court. He demonstrated how complete his game is by smartly adjusting to his reality at the beginning of the season. To make up for his slower first step, he began to take a dramatically higher volume of mid-range shots and found immediate success. His defense, often singled out as a weakness, has continued to chart improvement. As critics still questioned his form, he embarked on a personal record of 14 consecutive games with at least 25 points. Criticism will always follow success and the self-awareness with which Don\u010di\u0107 has navigated increased scrutiny this year underlines why he has reached these heights so soon in the first place. Even in a world of vicious armchair analysts across social media, there is no harsher critic of Don\u010di\u0107 than himself. His explanations to unconvinced reporters that he couldn\u2019t possibly be playing well if his team is losing, even as he\u2019s been nearly averaging a triple-double on the season, have become a common trope. And when his frequent lobbying of referees came under fire, rather than responding defensively when the subject was raised, he owned up to it and pledged to stop. He has mostly kept quiet since. Since the middle of February, the tide has slowly turned for the Mavericks as the team has shaken off Covid and all the complications it has wrought on their season. Dallas have now won 10 of their last 12 games, propelling themselves from 14th to eighth and into the thick of the playoff hunt. It\u2019s also brought the re-emergence of Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s three-pointer, which now looks as polished than ever. He is taking smarter shots and veering more to his favorite spot on the left, but remains capable of exploding from any part of the court and at any time: as the Boston Celtics learned the hard way when he drained a pair of three-pointers in the final 17 seconds to win the game. A grueling second-half slate of 38 games in 68 days will test Don\u010di\u0107\u2019s fitness to its limits, but the weeks, months and years to come are squarely on his side.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Friend of accuser says he has 'clear recollections of relevant discussions' with minister \u2013 as it happened", "full_article": "  7.28am GMT    What happened today    This is where we\u2019ll leave our live coverage for the day.

Christian Porter has denied the allegation, dating back to 1988, which was contained in documents sent to the prime minister in late February by the woman\u2019s friends. Following questions in a state budget estimates hearing, NSW police on Friday lodged a summary of its dealings with the woman who made the allegation against Porter. The summary revealed that after Scott Morrison sent the bundle of documents his office had received anonymously on to the AFP, it only provided NSW police with a \u201csummary email\u201d of the allegation. \u201cHowever, no attachments were provided,\u201d NSW police said in its response to the questions in estimates.

The \u201cGrand Chief\u201d died of pancreatic cancer on February 26 aged 84, with the government declaring two weeks of mourning, ending with Friday\u2019s four-hour service at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium. PNG\u2019s Post-Courier newspaper reported on Friday morning that the stadium was packed to capacity with more than 20,000 people, with one group storming the gates and overpowering marshals to force their way in. The funeral service, to be led by Cardinal Sir John Ribat, was due to start at 1pm local time and finish at 5pm. Sir Michael\u2019s wife, Lady Veronica, arrived at the stadium in a wheelchair with her sons, daughters and grandchildren, the Post-Courier reported. There has been a recent surge in coronavirus cases in PNG, prompting the Somare family to urge people to stay Covid-safe and watch the service from home live on television. \u201cSir Michael would have wanted us all to keep each other safe, especially during these unprecented times. Stay home if you can and follow the directions of health authorities,\u201d Sir Michael\u2019s daughter Bertha said in a statement. Sir Michael was PNG\u2019s first prime minister following the nation\u2019s independence in 1975 and had later stints in the top job, serving 17 years in that role.     Updated at 6.05am GMT     5.51am GMT       Age care services minister Richard Colbeck has warned it will take \u201cprobably a couple of years\u201d before the full benefits of a new aged care act \u2013 recommended by the royal commission to enshrine \u201ca universal right to high quality, safe and timely support and care\u201d \u2013 will be felt by older Australians.  As the Morrison government considers the royal commission\u2019s 148 recommendations and outlines its plan for the sector before the 11 May budget, Colbeck told a Committee for Economic Development of Australia webinar on Friday that he hoped some reforms could be actioned as early as July \u2013 specifically new regulations limiting the use of chemical restraints.  However he indicated the government would take its time drafting a new aged care act \u2013 a recommendation made by both commissioners \u2013 appearing to suggest it aims to only meet the 1 July 2023 deadline the commissioners set for the new act. In addition to the new aged care act which Colbeck said would provide the foundations for the sector\u2019s reforms, Colbeck indicated the government would provide further investment for home care packages, and adopt transparency measures about aged care providers\u2019 performance, in the budget response.   It\u2019s probably a couple of years that will be required for a new act ... the scoping, the drafting and the legislating of a new act is going to take a period of time.   Other recommendations from the royal commission include setting requirements for aged care residents to receive 200 minutes of care per day, higher requirements for staff qualifications and resulting pay rises, as well as a levy to raise the additional money the reforms require. Economists have calculated Australia\u2019s aged care system will require at least $36bn each year if the Morrison government adopts the royal commission\u2019s cheapest recommendations to address neglect and abuse and realise a right of care for older Australians. You can read more about the aged care royal commission recommendations here:   Related: Relying on casuals in aged care will weaken royal commission's reforms, experts warn      Updated at 6.00am GMT     5.41am GMT       Liberal MP Jason Falinski has been asked, on ABC News, whether he thinks the government should hold an independent inquiry into the allegations against Christian Porter. Allegations that Porter strenuously denies. Falinski, wearing some kind of football scarf, said:  Yeah, sure, we should set up an independent inquiry. If we want to have governments setting up independent inquiries outside the justice system.  I mean, what is at stake when people make calls like this is that you would then move from the rule of law to the rule of individuals where any government can decide that it wants to start having inquiries into all sorts of different things. This is an exceptionally difficult circumstance, what happened here. These are tragic events, it is an incredibly hard case. There are two people who were 17 and 16 at the time. The attorney general has made it very clear that he denies the allegations, he denies anything untoward happened, and this has been investigated independently by the New South Wales police.  The calls for the government to set up a separate inquiry is just simply taking us into extraordinarily dangerous situations and an area and we have seen that when countries in the past have done this, that it is not the guilty who end up being persecuted, it is the innocent.  A fact check: the case has not been investigated by NSW police as the complainant died before she was able to give a police interview. Police have said they are not able to progress the matter. As Labor MP Louise Pratt said:  Well, the rule of law can\u2019t resolve this issue. The alleged victim is dead and the police have acknowledged that they can\u2019t continue with inquiries because of that fact. But this nation needs a process in order to assure ourselves that we have an attorney general that is fit for office.  I would note that this government, you know \u2013 they put Julia Gillard through a royal commission, I saw Carmen Lawrence go through a royal commission many years ago. They\u2019re quite prone, frankly, to putting up their own independent inquiries when it suits them. So I think this is nothing other than a convenient response to the government to be able to say that the rule of law needs to speak for itself.      Updated at 5.46am GMT     5.31am GMT    Businesswoman and friend of ousted MinterEllison CEO says there appeared to be 'almost a conspiracy to destroy her'    An experienced business woman says former MinterEllison chief executive Annette Kimmitt\u2019s departure from the firm came after what appeared to be \u201calmost a conspiracy to destroy her\u201d in the media. Susan Oliver said Kimmitt, who she co-founded an angel investor network for women with in 2013, had found it extremely tough as the circumstances behind her departure played out publicly in the past week. Kimmitt left MinterEllison by \u201cmutual agreement\u201d after an internal feud about the firm\u2019s legal representation of Christian Porter spilled into the open. Oliver is the chair or director at a number of companies and organisations, including the Wheeler Centre. She said:  It\u2019s a big punishment for what appears to be not a wise email, but a relatively small matter. I think that it should be acknowledged that Annette is a very intelligent woman with a strong and accomplished career. From the outside, because I\u2019m not within Minters, I know she\u2019s contributed as much as she possibly could.  Oliver said the media coverage leading up to Kimmitt\u2019s departure had, in some cases, been \u201cpunitive\u201d and \u201cjust extraordinary\u201d, with some articles comparing her departure with the exodus of senior leaders from Rio Tinto after the destruction of Juukan Gorge.  I just believe there\u2019s almost a conspiracy to destroy her, which is very unnecessary.  Oliver said Kimmitt\u2019s departure raised questions about the culture at MinterEllison, but also the broader corporate world.  Sometimes when women are selected in a job, there\u2019s a sense that when they start to be leaders, there\u2019s some discomfort about them asserting that leadership. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve built a culture that really accepts differences. If we have organisations where everybody feels they have to walk in the same way, how will they see the opportunities. When you look at EY [Ernst and Young, Kimmitt\u2019s previous employer] and most of the professional firms, they\u2019ve got the best approaches. I think [Kimmitt] came from an exemplary culture and perhaps expected to find the same thing at Minters.     Updated at 9.45am GMT     5.26am GMT       Brimingham was also asked to comment on a statement made by James Hooke about the woman who accused attorney-general Christian Porter of rape. Hooke also said he had \u201cclear recollections of relevant discussions\u201d with Porter in the 1990s.  Porter has strongly denied the allegations. Asked for his response to this statement, Birmingham said:  Well, I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t seen those reports or comments, and I wouldn\u2019t really have any knowledge in relation to what historic discussions anybody may have had.  Does this increase the pressure on the federal government to set up an independent inquiry?  Well, the South Australian police are finalising their reports and advice to the South Australian coroner and he will make his decision in full independence, as is appropriate, with the laws under which the coroner operates to determine what steps may occur in relation to an inquest or other activity, and I think those legal processes ought to be run and to run their course free of any form of political interference.  Does Birmingham think there should be an independent inquiry separate to the coronial inquest, which will concentrate on the women\u2019s death?  I think that we have a well-established rule of law in Australia, that it treats everybody equally, that there are proper processes attached to it and that we ought to let those processes run their proper course of events and that, I\u2019m sure, is what will be the case in relation to the South Australian coroner and the police who are supporting him in his work.     Updated at 5.31am GMT     5.21am GMT       Government frontbencher Simon Birmingham told ABC he was not able to say how Linda Reynolds\u2019 \u201clying cow\u201d comment was meant to be interpreted, because he wasn\u2019t present when it was said. Reynolds reached a confidential settlement with her former staffer Brittany Higgins over the comment, which was reportedly made after Higgins\u2019 allegation of being raped by a colleague in Reynolds\u2019s ministerial office was made public.  In a statement, the defence minister said she \u201cdid not mean it in the sense it may have been understood\u201d but said that given it had been made public, she wanted to \u201cretract it and unreservedly apologise to Brittany Higgins and acknowledge the hurt and distress it caused to her\u201d. Speaking to ABC24 this afternoon, Birmingham was asked whether it was appropriate that the formal apology took this long. He said:  Well, I believe there have been discussions between Ms Higgins and Senator Reynolds. As I had said previously, it was appropriate for Senator Reynolds to apologise and apologise to the full satisfaction of Ms Higgins and I hope the steps that have been taken achieve that outcome.  What else could the comment have been taken to mean?   Look, I don\u2019t know, I wasn\u2019t present. But what I hope for is that Ms Higgins is satisfied with the retraction and the full apology that has been provided.        5.11am GMT       A Coalition-majority Senate committee has paved the way for the government\u2019s controversial Online Safety bill to be debated when parliament returns next week. The Senate committee report recommends the bill be passed, which will give a broad range of new powers to the eSafety commissioner aimed at tackling online bullying, as well as censorship powers over adult content on social media. The Coalition senators on the committee noted the concerns raised about the new powers, with little oversight or transparency, but argued parliament will have oversight over how it operates. On regulating online content, the senators noted that the classification system is currently under review, and adult content would not be targeted as part of the enforcement of the new law:  In this respect, the committee notes the commissioner\u2019s view that the new scheme is intended to focus on online harm, which the committee considers is an appropriate approach and which would not capture the significant majority of adult content online.  Labor senators raised concerns about the balance between free speech, and required protections against certain kinds of speech such as bullying, in the context of the extensive new powers over speech to be granted to the commissioner:  Labor Senators find it curious that a government that has made repeated attempts to repeal section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act on the grounds that it unduly restricts free speech despite the availability of defences in section 18D, is now seeking to rush through a bill that empowers the eSafety commissioner with discretion to determine matters of speech in relation to adult cyberbullying without greater checks and balances.  Labor called on the government to consider amendments around the scope of the powers, the appeals process, oversight and transparency for the commissioner\u2019s proposed powers.  The Greens called for the legislation to be withdrawn and re-written to address the concerns raised about the new powers, as well as the impact the legislation would have on lawful online content and sex workers.       5.04am GMT       Daily Telegraph editor Ben English has criticised the Morrison government for the speed of the vaccine rollout, saying ScoMo was \u201cin danger of becoming SloMo\u201d.

Local Matt Bowtell told reporter Justine Landis-Hanley:   They throw the fat over the fence, and the bag breaks, and it just pours all over him and he\u2019s just gagging \u2013 it\u2019s just like that. You are walking towards this whale \u2013 this beautiful, majestic creature \u2013 and suddenly you can feel your feet getting heavier and heavier. And you look down and it\u2019s just curdled sand. All this fat and blubber has washed out to sea and been brought back up to the high tide mark. It\u2019s like you have dipped your foot in a grease tray. And the more you try and rub it off, the more it is rubbing in.  Bowtell said he ruined his favourite shoes \u2013 a pair of blue suede Jordans \u2013 by walking on the sand. He didn\u2019t leave them by the stairs in case they got stolen, and said their current state, which is absolutely stinking of dead whale, is \u201cfunny in hindsight\u201d. Another local said the whale smelled \u201clike nothing I have ever smelled before\u201d.  We didn\u2019t get closer than 30 metres but all had to shower and wash hair to get rid of the smell.

More from AAP:Mohinder Singh was sleep-deprived and drug-affected when he crashed a 19-tonne semi-trailer into the officers impounding a Porsche on the Eastern Freeway last April.Leading senior constable Lynette Taylor, senior constable Kevin King and constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died.Singh\u2019s barrister, Peter Morrissey, told a pre-sentence hearing in Victoria\u2019s supreme court on Friday:  There\u2019s no real way of saying it but he\u2019s very sorry. Mr Singh was instantly shattered by what he did. But he\u2019s not getting away with anything here \u2013 he\u2019s facing the music. His remorse is palpable, sustained and authentic.  Singh had admitted to other police who arrived at the crash scene he hadn\u2019t been fit to work that day.  He said:  Tell the families I swear to God I didn\u2019t mean to hurt them. It was a really big accident. I\u2019ve got nothing against police.  The 48-year-old has pleaded guilty to four counts of culpable driving causing death, three counts of drug trafficking and one count of drug possession. Singh had been using and trafficking drugs and had very little sleep in the lead-up to the crash, the court was told. That morning, he had been \u201ctalking nonsense\u201d about being chased by witches. A witness said:  I had never seen anyone as drug f---ed in my life.  Morrissey asked Justice Paul Coghlan to \u201cmix justice with mercy and clemency\u201d in punishing Singh. He also thanked Victoria police on behalf of the Singh family for conducting a fair and balanced investigation. Singh will be sentenced on 14 April.

Many of the more than 400 submissions to the consultation on the draft legislation said the proposed new powers for taking down bullying and adult content went too far, but Adani proposed it should be extended further. In a submission, first reported by CommsDay executive editor Rohan Pearce, Adani\u2019s country head, Lucas Dow, said activists opposed to the company\u2019s mining operations in Australia had begun doxing the personal information including mobile numbers, email addresses and, in one case, an executive\u2019s home address online.  He said:  While some posts contain personal information where followers are advised to \u2018politely\u2019 contact that person, the reality is that many of these direct communications are menacing, offensive and can cause serious distress and harm to an individual.  Harassing people this way is already a crime under Australian law, but Dow said the doxing had led to employees receiving \u201ca significant volume of phone calls and texts \u2013 many threatening and abusive \u2013 to their mobile phones\u201d and called for the practice to be made illegal:  Others have had their calendars jammed with meetings to the point where they are unusable, and in extreme cases activists have shown up to people\u2019s personal homes, with their families present, demanding an audience.  These occurrences were only possible due to activists publishing personal details on social media platforms. As a company we have seen first-hand the personal distress caused by doxing and the impact it has on the mental and physical health. It is our submission that the online release of personal information without express authorisation of the individual/s should be illegal.\u201d  The claim comes just four months after Guardian Australia revealed Adani had hired a private investigator to follow anti-Adani activist Ben Pennings, who took photographs of Pennings walking his nine-year-old daughter to primary school, trawled his wife\u2019s Facebook page and followed her to work. The Senate committee\u2019s report on the bill is expected to be tabled today.    Updated at 3.58am GMT     3.24am GMT       Here is James Hooke\u2019s public statement in full:  I was mentioned in the Australian and the Adelaide Advertiser this week, and I am referred to in [an] unsworn statement and the extracts from [my friend\u2019s] diaries. I continue to be repeatedly contacted by numerous journalists seeking public comment, and in response, I make the following personal statement. But beyond this, I have no further public comment at this time. I continue to be devastated by the untimely death of my very dear friend, and I am enormously concerned for the privacy and dignity of [my friend\u2019s] family. I am also concerned for the well-being of Christian Porter. I have known all of them for approximately 30 years. We all find ourselves at a very upsetting time. Mine is just one set of recollections, and I am aware of the fallibility of human memory, however unintentional. That said, I have what I consider to be clear recollections of relevant discussions I had with [my friend] over the years from mid-1988 until her death. I also have what I consider to be clear recollections of relevant discussions I had with Christian Porter from April 1992 in Perth and through the mid-1990s. The NSW police have determined that a criminal prosecution is not possible in this case. I made myself known to the NSW police after [my friend\u2019s] death and I understand why they were unable to interview me. In relation to any criminal prosecution, Christian Porter was manifestly and appropriately entitled to the presumption of innocence \u2013 it is essential to the rule of law. In relation to any investigation of the important non-criminal aspects of this matter, I support an inquiry, like either that conducted by three retired eminent judges after Justice Lionel Murphy was acquitted of charges or that conducted by Dr Vivienne Thom into allegations about Justice Heydon. I am willing to testify under oath at any appropriately convened inquiry. While I fully support the freedom of the press, I do not believe that the media is the optimal forum in which to investigate a situation of this sensitivity and significance.

Macquarie Bank managing director James Hooke released a statement on Friday afternoon as someone who has known Porter\u2019s accuser, and Porter, for the past 30 years. Hooke said the woman, who he considered to be a \u201cvery dear friend\u201d, and he had \u201crelevant discussions\u201d about the event from \u201cmid-1988 until her death\u201d. Hooke also recollects speaking with Porter about the allegations from 1992 onwards. Porter has vigorously denied all the allegations against him as \u201cnever happening\u201d.

I wanted to alert you to a bit of polling out of Western Australia, which shows that opposition leader Zak Kirkup is extremely likely to lose his seat in tomorrow\u2019s election \u2014 the first Liberal leader to do so in 88 years. The polling was conducted by YouGov for The West Australian. It shows the Labor candidate, Lisa Munday, on a primary vote of 55% and a swing toward Labor of 10.7% in the seat if the polling results are replicated on Saturday. Now, the usual caveats apply: single seat polling can be unreliable, and the sample size is just 400 people, although YouGov said it did use mobile phone numbers and used quotas to ensure a good spread of the population was represented. But Kirkup currently has a margin of just 0.7%, so even if the polling is out by a few points it\u2019s not looking good.       3.02am GMT       A Victorian firefighter has broken down before the media diversity inquiry while giving evidence about the alleged \u201cvilification\u201d of members of the firefighters\u2019 union by the Herald Sun. Peter Marshall, the national and Victorian branch secretary of the United Firefighters Union, was in tears as he spoke about the lack of justice available to members of the public who have been attacked by tabloid newspapers. He said defamation was not an option and the press council refused to take their multiple complaints, saying they didn\u2019t have the resources.Marshall told senators that between 2015 and 2016 the Herald Sun \u201cran a concerted campaign\u201d against the career firefighters which was \u201cone-sided, inaccurate and unrelenting\u201d. He said:  During this period, the Herald Sun unjustly and offensively represented professional firefighters as greedy, lazy and indifferent to public safety \u2013 and more.

Italy followed Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Lithuania in banning inoculations with one particular batch of 1m doses that was sent to 17 countries.

The deficit, revealed in Victoria\u2019s mid-year financial report released on Friday, was attributed to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent slowdown in the state\u2019s economy. Net debt increased by $17.4bn to $61.7bn to pay for the government\u2019s response to the pandemic as well as a suite of infrastructure projects. Total revenue for the six months to December was $30.9bn, about 46% of the published full-year budget estimate and a decrease of $2.5bn from the same period last year. This was in part due to the closures of Crown Casino, hotels and clubs depriving the state of gambling taxes and the reduction in payroll tax, as Victorians worked fewer hours due to the pandemic and the government offered up payroll tax waivers and refunds. The state was forced into a second lockdown in July, lasting 112 days, after coronavirus escaped hotel quarantine and spread into the community, killing hundreds. Tough restrictions were also imposed on New Year\u2019s Eve as the state battled a cluster linked to a Black Rock Thai restaurant. Treasurer Tim Pallas said in a statement the state\u2019s economy recovered strongly in the December quarter as restrictions eased:  After all the sacrifices Victorians have made to get this virus under control, we are seeing the rewards in a rebounding economy offering more jobs, more investment and more opportunity... Victoria was the fastest growing economy in the nation before the pandemic and our strong fundamentals are on show now as we surge towards a healthy recovery.

The marches are intended to increase pressure on the federal government to call for an independent parliamentary enquiry into allegations that the attorney general, Christian Porter, raped a 16-year-old girl when he was 17, at a school debating competition in 1988. He has categorically denied these allegations.  So far the government maintains that as NSW police have declared that they are unable to open an investigation into the issue (largely due to the woman ending her life last year before making a formal statement to police), there is no need for an independent investigation, and launching one would compromise the \u201crule of law\u201d in Australia.  Greens MP Larissa Waters says all women in her party will walk out of parliament on Monday and join the protest:  These last few weeks have made every woman in the country angry, sad, outraged and exhausted. We are calling on women parliamentarians from all parties, and women who work in Parliament House, to join the march and stand in solidarity and demand better. The government\u2019s reaction and its subsequent lack of action in response to allegations of sexual assault in Parliament House and allegations of rape against the attorney general have left many of us feeling disgusted and fed up.

While he said this was an issue he didn\u2019t have any concrete strategies for how the government to contract this:  We did recommend that ACMA [Australian Communications and Media Authority] bring in place a disinformation, misinformation code, where they could have the power to take down \u2013 or agree on processes where the platforms would take down \u2013 deliberate misinformation, disinformation... I think, trying to deal with the privacy issues would also help because part of this is all the data that people have on you and how they can then target you. Beyond that senator ... I just think it\u2019s an issue to be watched and kept an eye on I don\u2019t have an immediate answer as to how you deal with it, but I think it just needs to be watched.

Nine certainly is one because of their TV, radio, and they\u2019ve probably got the dominant commercial radio network in every city, and they\u2019ve got very important newspapers. The ABC, it\u2019s got Radio TV everywhere. Seven West Media.  But you know a lot of people I know read The Guardian.  Carr:   You know, a lot of people I know read The Guardian, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily change dramatically the level of ownership or control of the media in this country.

He said the current merger laws could have allowed News Corp (Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun, Sky News etc) to buy competitor Fairfax (Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, Macquarie Radio etc) if they had been so inclined.   I said publicly ... that we would not allow News Limited to acquire Fairfax.  Now you might think that\u2019s obvious, but I said that loudly and clearly to get the message out. Had News Corp wanted to buy Fairfax and that went to court. I honestly don\u2019t know whether we\u2019d have won or lost.  And that\u2019s where the merger laws, I think, do need [to be strong] because that I think by any definition should never be allowed. That didn\u2019t happen or probably wasn\u2019t even contemplated, but that\u2019s where we could improve our merger laws but that\u2019s a general issue rather than a media diversity issue.  Just an FYI: Fairfax has since been bought by Nine.

That\u2019s quite recently. There was unlimited overtime and TOIL with no pay.  I\u2019m told [by my picture editor] that if I didn\u2019t like my job that I could work at Maccas... The contract that we all had to sign gave the company the right to listen into our phone conversations. And you couldn\u2019t get a job with News Corp without signing that.  I wasn\u2019t ever offered employment under the EBA I was only ever offered employment under the contract.  I\u2019ve known employees on the award who weren\u2019t pay their entitlements or penalties.  I know of cadets who weren\u2019t graded accordingly after the requisite time.  So when I say, high staff turnover; since, 2015, we\u2019ve had 53 staff leave out of the office. Thirty resigned. Nineteen have been made redundant, three sacked, two died.

Australian university vice-chancellors are routinely paid far higher salaries than their equivalents overseas.  Scott will take over the role on 19 July, 2021.

Long-term News Corp Australia photographer based in Cairns, Anna Rogers, is speaking now about her experience in the company.  Senator Sarah Hanson-Young is asking Rogers about the times then prime minister Tony Abbott visited the newsroom.  Rogers:  I also think that, you know, the visits by Tony Abbott ... I\u2019m pretty sure he can reinforce, you know the angle that we were expected to take.  Hanson-Young:  What would happen when the prime minister would come to the newsroom?  Rogers:  He would meet with the editor and the managing bosses.  Hanson-Young:  And were you all told that the prime minister would be coming?  Rogers:  Yeah, and he\u2019d come and speak to the newsroom and come say hello and so forth.

The 25-year veteran of News Corp, who worked for many years at the Courier Mail, was made redundant last year and the union had to fight for her proper entitlements, she told the media diversity inquiry.Rogers says the newspapers\u2019 coverage is also driven by sexism, with directions to photographers not to shoot \u201ca pig in lipstick\u201d and only shoot attractive young women under the age of 35.She says subscription targets are now driving court coverage with photographers told to mine social media accounts of defendants rather than read the charges.

This will no doubt help raise confidence that the Melbourne airport quarantine hotel cluster has died out (although 28 days is needed in order to confirm elimination).  It\u2019s worth noting that the last cases two weeks ago came from people already in quarantine, so posed no infection risk to the public.     Yesterday there were no new cases reported. 18,827 test results were received.

Denmark, Norway and Iceland have temporarily stopped using the vaccine while authorities investigate whether it is linked to blood clots. (There are about 30 cases out of five million doses given out so far.) Other countries stopped the usage of a specific batch of the vaccine.  But Dutton told the Today Show that Australian authorities do not share these concerns:  The way in which this rollout has worked, not just here but around the world, means that we do have an enormous amount of data.. And the conclusion here is that the vaccine is safe, it will continue to rollout.     Updated at 11.27pm GMT     10.48pm GMT    Government will consider adding Mildura and Albury-Wodonga airports to tourism package    McCormack said Avalon airport was chosen as the government subsidised destination in Victoria as the nearby Great Ocean Road was heavily reliant on international tourists.   With the Great Ocean Road, that is where international tourists flock to. That is one of the biggest areas, which was hardest hit in Victoria. So, that was why we put Avalon on the list... There are many fine operators up and down the Great Ocean Road. It is a fantastic area. I encourage Australians to go and visit. Take a drive or take one of the half price tickets. Go to Avalon. See the Great Ocean Road. Magnificent. Twelve Apostles. Look at it!      One of the most popular attractions along the Great Ocean Road, Victoria, the Twelve Apostles. Photograph: TGR Photography/Getty Images    The deputy prime minister said the government would potentially consider adding other Victorian airports like Mildura or Albury-Wodonga (technically NSW, but it\u2019s on the border) to the list, but didn\u2019t miss the chance to slam Victorian acting premier James Merlino:  Like I say it is an initial list, an initial list of 15. We will certainly look at those other centres and other destinations as well but I will not stand here and take lectures from James Merlino.  I appreciate he is the acting premier and wants to get out and get on the front foot and get a headline for himself. A bit rich coming out and criticising the federal government when we have provided so much support for Melbourne, for regional Victoria, for the state of Victoria in general. When it\u2019s been the Victorian Labor government that at the drop of a hat has closed its border and then caused so much heartbreak and hardship for so many people in this state.      Updated at 11.01pm GMT     10.41pm GMT       Given McCormack is speaking from Melbourne, perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that questions have quickly turned to the Victorian state government\u2019s displeasure at the federal travel rescue package.  Only one of the 15 \u201chalf-price\u201d destinations is in Victoria, Avalon airport, only an hour out of the city. Acting Victorian premier James Merlino has slammed the plan, but McCormack says the state\u2019s long and economically devastating lockdowns doesn\u2019t mean they deserve a larger share in the $1.2bn package.   Well, the Victorian government locked down their borders like that. At the drop of the hat. Hasty decisions. Locked borders when they had a couple of community outbreaks.  I appreciate last July it was difficult when there was that massive outbreak which cost the lives of more than 800 people. I understand that. I know whatever we think and say about our premiers, they have done what they thought they needed to do to protect the people in their state. But it has come at a big cost. Come at a big cost to business. Come at a big cost to livelihoods... Particularly when I have members in my own party who were far closer to Adelaide and South Australia than they were to Melbourne. Yet they were still under the same impositions that Melbourne was. I mean, I spoke to farmers who had to wear, for goodness sake, face masks to go and check on their stock when they were many hundreds of kilometres from Melbourne. That is pretty hard. That\u2019s pretty difficult.      Updated at 10.48pm GMT     10.32pm GMT       Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack says there is \u201cstill hope\u201d for vaccinating all adult Australians by the end of October, but seem to have conceded it\u2019s not that likely. He is speaking to media now from Melbourne:  There\u2019s still the plan that\u2019s still the hope ... Australia is a big nation. I\u2019m pleased as a regional member that regional people are being vaccinated at the same rate as our city friends.  We have a plan. We\u2019re rolling it out. We\u2019re getting on with the job.  It won\u2019t go flawlessly all the way through. The health minister Greg Hunt has acknowledged that, the prime minister acknowledged that, but we do the very best we can for a very large nation \u2013 this is the largest peacetime logistical exercise in Australia\u2019s history.

Australia Prudential Regulation Authority watchers will not be surprised to learn that no breaches of the Banking Act or the Banking Executive Accountability Regime (a name clearly cooked up so that the acronym Bear could be used) and it thinks there\u2019s no further action required.  The bank is already subject to an enforceable undertaking and a $1bn add-on to the amount of capital it\u2019s required to hold. In a statement, deputy Apra chair John Lonsdale said:   Although the investigation has not found evidence of breaches of the Banking Act or the Bear, Apra remains determined to ensure Westpac rectifies its risk governance weaknesses effectively and sustainably. Under the enforceable undertaking, Westpac has clearly defined executive and board accountabilities for the implementation of its integrated risk governance remediation plan.

The program has promised 800,000 government subsidised plane tickets to 15 tourist destinations in an attempt to bolster domestic tourism as jobkeeper ends.     Home affairs minister Peter Dutton. Photograph: Darren England/AAP    But many have accused the government of choosing destinations disproportionately located in marginal electorates in order to court regional votes.  Dutton spoke about the package on the Today Show this morning:  There are lots of people that will take any dollar that you give them, and if you give them one dollar they ask for a second. The fact is mums and dads love this policy because they want a cheap airfare and they want to go for a holiday, they want to be able to spend money in regional areas.  Deputy opposition leader Richard Marles also spoke to Channel Nine saying the tourism package was a massive let down, describing it as merely \u201chalf-price tickets to marginal seats\u201d.

The vaccine\u2019s benefits continue to outweigh its risks.  Denmark, Norway and Iceland announced they were temporarily halting all AstraZeneca vaccinations to investigate the cases. Italy followed Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Lithuania in banning inoculations with one particular batch of 1m doses that was sent to 17 countries. Australia\u2019s vaccine strategy is highly reliant on the AstraZeneca jab, with the majority of the country expected to be immunised with it.

We need to be in line with the international standard of 14 at least. That would see 600 children released tomorrow!  So there are simple steps we can do to achieve that. In Victoria we\u2019ve had an increase of over 500% of incarceration of Aboriginal women. It just seems we get a little bit and then we\u2019re taken back another three steps.

The senator has just spoken to ABC News Breakfast and was asked if she see any improvement in the justice system:  Unfortunately, no. Not with the current government.  It\u2019s the 30th anniversary of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. This year, the families have called to meet with the prime minister. That\u2019s fallen on deaf ears so far.  So, I mean how many more deaths do we need to go through for people to actually listen and take this issue seriously?  We have almost had 500 deaths since the royal commission. In 30 years, 500 [deaths], and no one\u2019s immune. We\u2019re a tight-knit community, and we\u2019re all affected by this loss. And the systemic racism is real.  We\u2019re based on a colonial system, right, and that colonial system doesn\u2019t treat people in this country very well at all.

Jayne Hrdlicka has just spoken to ABC News Breakfast:  We\u2019ve announced redundancies that were necessary. As I mentioned, the total number of redundancies at Virgin just reduced as a consequence of the optimism we have with respect to the domestic market coming back and confidence the international border will open in October. Great news.  The people we are standing back up will be moving Australians to destinations across the country. For every dollar spent on a plane ticket, $10 is spent in the community. That\u2019s ultimately part of the travel agenda. The tourism businesses suffering right now are going to get the benefit associated with us moving people around the country now. So, the whole ecosystem starts to rise as Australians get out of the house.

Australia is already significantly behind schedule so the October deadline has been called into doubt.     Updated at 9.14pm GMT     8.43pm GMT    Welcome to Friday    Good morning, Matilda Boseley here with you to get through the last dying gasps of the week. At least in the political landscape, the federal government\u2019s tourism rescue package is still the hot topic of conversation.  Yesterday prime minister Scott Morrison announced $1.2bn dollars would be dedicated to providing half-priced plane tickets to a number of popular tourist destination in an attempt to bolster the travel sector as jobkeeper ends.  Morrison has rejected claims the government favoured Coalition and marginal seats when choosing these destinations, labelling opposition leader Anthony Albanese\u2019s accusation that southern Tasmania had been ignored because it was a safe Liberal seat as \u201cabsurd\u201d.   It\u2019s ridiculous. I mean, the northern parts of Tasmania is the regional part of the state which needs that additional support... We already have lots of flights going into Hobart.  The list released yesterday morning was just an \u201cinitial\u201d list, Morrison says, with the government already adding Darwin (a Labor stronghold) later on Thursday.  But it doesn\u2019t look like their troubles are over just yet, with Victorian leaders saying they have been short-changed after only receiving one (kinda weird) half-priced destination in the scheme.  Avalon airport was chosen, but it isn\u2019t exactly in the middle of a tourism hub. It\u2019s only an hour out of Melbourne, services the industrial city of Geelong, and while it would help funnel tourists down the Great Ocean Road, acting premier James Merlino says that won\u2019t be enough.   It\u2019s like they are looking at the Melbourne and Sydney markets and using them as the source for markets across the rest of the country. It is not fair, and we are disappointed... You only have to look at the numbers. Five in Queensland, three in Tassie, two in the Northern Territory, just one in Victoria. This is not a great outcome for tourism operators, other than those who will be serviced by flights to Avalon.  Now the other important thing happening today is the WA state election entering its final day, with opposition leader Zak Kirkup insisting he has no regrets, despite the Liberal\u2019s almost guaranteed defeat. This could also spell the end of Kirkup\u2019s short-lived political career after the 34-year-old has vowed to walk away from politics if he loses his ultra-marginal seat of Dawesville at Saturday\u2019s state election.  We\u2019ve done everything we can and will continue to work incredibly hard to get out there... It takes a toll but I promise you it is worth it for the people of Western Australia so that they understand exactly what it might mean if Labor gets total control and total power.  Uttering the phrase \u201cwe\u2019ve done everything we can\u201d in the dying hours of an election campaign is probably not a good sign, to be honest.  Well, with that why don\u2019t we jump into the day!

Anna Rogers, who was made redundant last year, told the media diversity inquiry she worked in a sexist and toxic culture at Cumberland Newspapers, the Australian, the Courier-Mail and the Cairns Post between 1991 and 2020, where men were consistently promoted over women.   Related: Kevin Rudd declares end to 'the age of male sexual entitlement'    Women were denied pay rises and flexible work hours and she believed all staff were forced to sign employment contracts which gave the company the right to \u201clisten in\u201d to their phone calls, she told senators. Rogers said she had been consistently told not to take pictures of \u201cpigs in lipstick\u201d while the appearance of male subjects was never raised. In 1994, when Paul Kelly was editor-in-chief of the Australian, she was told to take photographs of attractive women to increase female readership. \u201cDuring a news conference the editor Paul Kelly indicated to the news conference staff that the Australian wanted to increase female readership,\u201d Rogers said in her submission. \u201cHis argument was that women buy women\u2019s magazines and that they like to look at attractive women.\u201d In 2011, a picture editor at Queensland\u2019s Sunday Mail ordered social photographers not to take any pictures of any \u201cpigs in lipstick\u201d, which was interpreted to mean any middle-aged women or those who may be overweight or not conventionally attractive. \u201cWhile working on the Courier-Mail, I was encouraged to seek out attractive women to photograph to \u2018get a better run\u2019 in the Courier-Mail,\u201d she said. \u201cThis meant the photo would run in the earlier pages of the paper if the subject was attractive.\u201d    Former Murdoch reporters turning out in force to testify at the Senate Inquiry initiated following our #MurdochRoyalCommission petition.

She said the culture was \u201cextremely derogatory to women\u201d but she had to comply with directions from the editors and there was no avenue for dissent or complaint.     Rogers during her years at the Cairns Post. Photograph: Veronica Sagredo    \u201cTo keep my job, I had to apply this test which meant that women who were over 35, were overweight, were not photographed for the paper,\u201d Rogers said. \u201cWhile employed at the Cairns Post 2011 to 2020 I was encouraged to take photos of attractive young women, with instructions such as, \u2018Get a photo of a yummy mummy,\u2019 or, \u2018Get a photo of a pretty tourist.\u2019 \u201cAgain, there was the explanation that a photo of an attractive person would get a better run in the paper. \u201cI feel that this emphasis on the appearance of women has diminished the chance of being treated equally to men in the media. There was never a direction to get a photo of a \u2018handsome man\u2019. \u201cI believe this emphasis on women\u2019s looks has fostered sexism in our society. As a woman working in the media, the emphasis on the appearance of women made me feel compromised and uncomfortable.\u201d Female politicians and wives of sportsmen, or wags, were derided for what they wore while men were treated on merit, she said. In mid-2019, subscription targets were introduced, she said, and staff became very stressed about having to sign on readers or miss a target. A managing editor at the Cairns Post sent an email to all editorial staff that year saying \u201cas you can imagine i get forensically anal-ised that\u2019s not a spelling mistake about our subscription targets\u201d.   Related: News Corp gives Kevin Rudd the silent treatment | The Weekly Beast    Rogers said a lack of diversity had allowed News Corp to descend from a reputable company to one where \u201cwomen are considered as pigs in lipstick, with a toxic work culture where even the managing editor feels he is being forensically anal-ised\u201d. She said: \u201cThe contract that we all had to sign gave the company the right to listen into our phone conversations. And you couldn\u2019t get a job with News Corp without signing that.\u201d She also said she had not been given bushfire training, she had been told to clean the company toilets during Covid, and she had not been provided with personal protective equipment except for a single mask. \u201cI believe that the clickbait culture has created a toxic culture where staff get intimidated and bullied,\u201d she said. Senators also heard from the Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, who said the news website was established in 2013 partly in response to the lack of media diversity in Australia. Taylor said Guardian Australia contributed to media diversity in the country but could not be seen as a counter-balance to the dominance of News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment because it was relatively small. Guardian Australia did not have the capacity to cover state politics, courts or many specialist rounds, she said. It employed 112 full-time equivalent staff including 76 journalists. Taylor was asked about her previous experiences working at News Corp and she said she was never directed to write something while reporting for the Australian. However, she said she would occasionally get briefs from news conference in her second stint at the paper after 2007, and when she didn\u2019t agree with the brief she would push back and editors would drop it or give it to another reporter.

Klan, a Walkley award-winning finance reporter at the Australian for 15 years, revealed he had a significant investigation spiked after lobbying from Westpac. He was called into the office of then-editor John Lehmann to discuss the story and there were several Westpac executives on speakerphone during the meeting. \u201cI was told I was not permitted to speak, although the meeting was held over speakerphone and only Lehmann spoke from the Australian\u2019s end,\u201d Klan told the inquiry. \u201cOn the other line, there were up to a dozen Westpac executives and lawyers. What ensued was all aimed at preventing the story from being published.\u201d Veteran News Corp journalist Tony Koch told the inquiry the company had taken a \u201chuge right turn\u201d since he first began his career more than 30 years ago.

In the first month since leaving the EU on terms agreed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government, the Office for National Statistics said goods exports to the bloc fell by \u00a35.6bn, while imports fell by 28.8%, or \u00a36.6bn.   Related: Labour suggests ministers failed to do analysis of Brexit deal    Exports of food and live animals to the EU were the hardest hit by Brexit, collapsing by 63.6% in January. Consignments of fish and shellfish collapsed by 83% from the level a year ago to only \u00a316m. This reflected heavier disruption and additional checks for consignments from this sector that prompted furious protests from the fishing industry. However, food and live animals account for only 7% of total UK exports.   UK exports   After stockpiling and disruption at UK borders in the run-up to the Brexit transition, the decline also came as the economy in January shrank by the largest amount since the first wave of the pandemic, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling 2.9% from December, according to the ONS. The ONS said the January performance was the worst since monthly records began in 1997, as a 1.7% rise in non-EU trade, worth \u00a3200m, failed to make up for the plunge in cross-border activity with the UK\u2019s biggest trading partner. Overall, global UK exports and imports fell by about a fifth.   Related: UK forced to delay checks on imports from EU by six months    Although January\u2019s GDP figure represents the biggest contraction since the first lockdown almost a year ago, analysts had forecast a bigger decline of 4.9%, suggesting that businesses and households adapted better to harsh restrictions than during the first wave of the pandemic, when GDP fell by more than 20% in April 2020. Experts said the scale of the decline in January trade was unlikely to be permanent because there was evidence companies stockpiled goods before the Brexit deadline, meaning they would not need to send as many shipments as usual in January. The decline was lower than a 68% plunge reported by road hauliers, while the ONS said there were signs trade had started to pick up at the end of the month.   UK GDP   The closure of shops during the Covid-19 lockdown reduced demand for clothing shipments, car production fell and exports were weak to EU countries as tougher coronavirus restrictions were imposed across the continent. Alongside stockpiling, Covid disruption and lockdown, the ONS also changed the way it collects export data after Brexit, which could mean it takes longer to record some UK goods shipped to the EU. The prime minister\u2019s former chief Brexit negotiator Lord Frost said there was a \u201cunique combination of factors\u201d that meant it was \u201cinevitable that we would see some unusual figures this January\u201d. Frost, who was elevated last month to become the cabinet minister responsible for Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU, said these effects were now \u201cstarting to unwind\u201d and that overall freight volumes had been \u201cback to their normal levels for over a month now\u201d. However, one economist said Brexit played a decisive role in January and would continue to weigh on growth. \u201cBrexit made a bad situation worse,\u201d said Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics. \u201cBrexit is best seen as a slow puncture, rather than a sudden blowout, with the costs gradually accumulating in the form of lower investment and immigration than otherwise would have been the case.\u201d   UK exports   In a reflection of the Brexit impact, UK goods exports to Ireland fell 47% in January, the sharpest fall among main trading partners. While the government has admitted to \u201cteething problems\u201d at the start of the new relationship, business leaders have warned that lengthier delivery times and higher costs are likely to remain as an endemic feature of Brexit. Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \u201cThe practical difficulties faced by businesses on the ground go well beyond just teething problems and with disruption to UK-EU trade flows persisting, trade is likely to be a drag on UK economic growth in the first quarter of 2021.\u201d     Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk   It comes as the government was forced this week to delay the introduction of further post-Brexit import checks by six months \u2013 a U-turn because a network of 30 border posts being built to process incoming goods would not have been ready on time.

The two are merely gossiping, but the aside is slyly placed, for the man who afterwards happens into view will more than prove her point. AK Blakemore\u2019s first novel is a fictional account of the Essex witch trials, and though it brims with language of arresting loveliness, it speaks plainly when it must. We meet the young Rebecca West in 1643, amid the early convulsions of the English civil war. Her mother, known as the Beldam West, is a doughty widow with a fondness for drink and confrontation. Rebecca must share her mother\u2019s mean lodgings and taint of disrepute, but though she chafes at the narrowness of her existence, she is not without resources. \u201cI am useful,\u201d she says of herself. \u201cI have taught myself to watch and listen.\u201d And not for nothing, in a place where neighbourly bonds are now frayed by hunger and suspicion. Though she seldom finds a warm welcome, Rebecca has a way of putting herself in the right company, of catching the low talk or stray look that might warn of what is coming. At church she and mother must take the back pew, but from there she can survey the townswomen who elsewhere disparage her, noting their \u201cemanations of rosewater perfume, womb-clot, sweat and cinders\u201d. When a pale stranger named Matthew Hopkins arrives on unstated business, his fine garments and apparent learning draw general admiration. But Rebecca takes his measure more carefully: \u201cThere is something about him slant and insubstantial, as though all [his] dramatic outfitting houses none of the usual human meat.\u201d She knows to keep these icily exact impressions to herself, but her instinct for self-concealment is tested by youthful desire. Though the fighting has left lean pickings, her attention settles \u2013 fatefully, it will turn out \u2013 on a mild-mannered young scholar named John Edes. Like Rebecca West, Edes is a documented figure in the archives Blakemore draws on, but their entanglement is among her inventions. It is rendered with sensuous precision, like so much of this novel, but its outcome is never really in doubt. Nor is it incidental: when cruelty is called for, few of the men here will be found wanting. The conflagration begins with little kindling. A drunkard sees shapes in the dark. Cattle and horses are variously afflicted, and a young boy stricken by mania. Petty grudges are stirred and fingers readily pointed. Hopkins steps forward, no longer reticent about his purpose, and a willing band of inquisitors soon assembles. This inchwise slide into depravity is as compelling as it is queasily familiar. The townsfolk are not all fanatics, but they find fanaticism quite to their liking. The Beldam is naturally among the accused and reacts with characteristic defiance. A witch, she says, \u201cis just their nasty word for anyone who makes things happen\u201d. But it is their word, too, for any woman living as she pleases, or merely within easy reach. Hopkins, now styling himself Witchfinder General, soon ensnares Rebecca herself. He finds her worthy of special attention. What follows must be hinted at with care, since Blakemore here spans a historical void, but it is persuasive and satisfying. Crucial to the proceedings is a grimly fascinating depiction of Hopkins, and one that strips away the aggrandisements of popular myth to show us an etiolated zealot who can\u2019t decide what offends him most \u2013 the baseness of his own nature or the knowledge that a woman has seen and understood it. What he denounces as sin, Rebecca tells him at a climactic moment, is \u201cthe filth you like to play in\u201d. There are people, and then there are men. The Manningtree Witches ventures into dark places, to be sure, but it carries a jewelled dagger. Blakemore is a poet, and readers given to underlining may find their pencils worn down to stubs. A black feather lying in the grass is \u201cglossy and ideal\u201d; a fall of sleet \u201crarefies into a silk mist\u201d. Her women are fiercely alive and, in the Beldam\u2019s case, often deliciously bawdy: \u201cA man like that\u2019d stick his thing up a haddock if a Bishop told him not to.\u201d Such sharp wit and rich textures would be welcome in any setting, but here they form what seems a fitting tribute. The persecutors in this tale are given close scrutiny, but the book belongs to the persecuted.

The league on Friday wrote to clubs to encourage them to participate in the studies, which will use eye tracking technology and \u201csmart\u201d mouthguards to collect data. The projects, named Bio-Eye and HitIQ, are the latest attempts by the league to address the issue of long-term effects of concussion.   Related: AFL concussion rules to be examined in Shane Tuck coroner's inquiry    Bio-Eye is an eye tracking technology that provides objective data the AFL hopes can supplement the subjective data and information that is already used by medical teams. HitIQ, meanwhile, uses a mouthguard-based head impact sensor system to gather data that can be used to explore any links between head knocks and concussion. The AFL\u2019s general counsel, Andrew Dillon, said he hoped the projects would provide the league and concussion experts with valuable data. \u201cThe health and safety of our players is of paramount concern to the AFL and we are committed to further research in this area,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cThe two studies will complement our continued action in this space over recent years including strengthening of the match-day protocols and amendments to the laws of the game to discourage high contact. \u201cWe are also using technology that is embedded in the ARC to provide another mechanism to identify potential concussive incidents that would not have otherwise been detected. We are encouraging all clubs to be involved in these studies.\u201d Bio-Eye\u2019s website claims it is a \u201clow-cost method for the detection of sports concussion at clinics and on the sidelines\u201d. The technology is also used to detect drug impairment in commercial truck drivers and to monitor cognitive decline, the website says.   Related: AFL considering proposal for landmark multimillion-dollar concussion trust for players    The AFL said the purpose of the study was \u201cto determine whether the Bio-Eye application provides a valuable addition to the tests commonly used to diagnose and manage concussion\u201d. The test, which uses a mobile phone to measure changes in eye movement, will be administered by club doctors or a nominated club representative, in addition to the existing tests clubs use to diagnose and manage concussion. The AFL has been researching the use of HitIQ for the past two seasons, but intends to expand the program via a phased rollout over the next three years, with the men\u2019s competition to employ the technology this season and the AFLW from 2022. Data from either study will not be used to diagnose concussion this season. The moves come amid an increasingly loud conversation over the long-lasting effects of head trauma in collision sports. The AFL has made recent attempts to address the issue and revealed new guidelines around head trauma in January, with players to be sidelined for at least 12 days if they suffer a concussion. Concern over concussions led the league on Friday to reportedly consider a request from some coaches to use a substitute player to replace a concussed teammate this season. The league is also understood to be considering a proposal for a landmark multimillion-dollar concussion trust for players.

In a report handed down on Friday, a government-controlled Senate committee backed its passage through parliament, while the Greens senator, Rachel Siewert, said the \u201cpitiful\u201d increase represented a \u201ccruel and mean-spirited\u201d cut from current Covid-boosted benefits. In additional comments added to the report, Labor MPs reiterated that the opposition, which had flagged possible amendments earlier this week, would not \u201cstand in the way\u201d of a \u201cmodest increase\u201d to welfare payments.

Under the bill, revealed by the Guardian last month, the government will increase the base rate of jobseeker, student and parenting payments by $50 a fortnight, or about $3.50 a day, from April. However, the coronavirus supplement \u2013 currently paid at $150 a fortnight \u2013 will be scrapped at the same time, meaning many see the change as a cut to the incomes of about 2 million people. In their additional comments to the Senate inquiry report, Labor senators argued its only options were to back the \u201cmodest\u201d increase or see the jobseeker payment revert back to the pre-pandemic base rate of $40 a day. They claimed they were unable to propose or support a higher boost to payments because \u201camendments moved by the opposition or the crossbench to increase the rate of payments, or otherwise increase expenditure, would not be considered by the House of Representatives\u201d. The opposition is yet to determine whether it will still seek to amend other aspects of the bill, but Labor senators backed concerns about proposed changes to the income-free area. Under that change, the amount jobseekers can earn from employment before their payment is cut will reduce from $300 to $150. Before the pandemic, the threshold was $106. In a dissenting report, Siewert argued for the jobseeker payment to be increased to the Henderson poverty line of $1,115 a fortnight, or $80 a day, the same rate supported by the Australian Unemployed Workers Union. The Greens senator argued that \u201cby keeping income support payments below the poverty line, this government is wilfully choosing to condemn Australians to living in poverty\u201d.

Askew said the committee believed the \u201ctaxpayer-funded increase\u201d of $50 a fortnight \u201cbalances the need to ensure payments encourage and enable workforce participation with the need for the welfare system to be fiscally sustainable for future generations\u201d. Since the mid-1990s, the jobseeker payment has only increased above inflation once, in 1994, and since the Howard era, it has fallen behind the age pension because it is pegged to inflation, rather than wages. The government said last month it would accompany the increase to payment with a hotline for employers to report jobseekers who do not take up work, and increased auditing of the quality of welfare recipients\u2019 job applications. However, data provided to the committee suggests large numbers of jobseekers are already being penalised under the government\u2019s welfare compliance regime. Since mutual obligations were reintroduced on 28 September, 616,862 jobseekers across jobactive, ParentsNext and Disability Employment Services had received a payment suspension.

There she was handcuffed to her hospital bed, accused of having an abortion, and charged with aggravated homicide. The authorities said Manuela \u2013 whose full name has never been made public in El Salvador \u2013 must have been guilty of killing her baby as the child was conceived outside marriage. They did not allow her to speak with a lawyer while she was being interrogated. Manuela was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Around the same time she was diagnosed with lymphatic cancer. Two years later, she died of her illness in prison. On Wednesday, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights heard arguments in Manuela v El Salvador, a landmark case that could shape policy and debate on abortion across Latin America. As well as seeking reparations for Manuela\u2019s family, the plaintiffs \u2013 a group of reproductive rights groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Feminist Collective for Local Development \u2013 are also asking the court to mandate that the state take responsibility for failing to guarantee Manuela\u2019s rights to health and life.

El Salvador has some of the world\u2019s most draconian abortion laws, with the procedure outlawed. Unlike in many other Latin American countries, El Salvador does not permit abortion in cases where the child is conceived by rape or incest, or where the health of the mother or child is at risk. The penalties for women are often enforced. Over the past two decades, about 181 women who experienced obstetric emergencies were prosecuted for abortion or aggravated homicide, according to rights groups. \u201cWe know that Manuela\u2019s case is not isolated and that many other women are in the same situation,\u201d said Catalina Mart\u00ednez Coral, regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean at the Center for Reproductive Rights. \u201cWhen Manuela went to hospital the doctors and the authorities immediately presumed guilt, going against all the guarantees of due process.\u201d           El Salvador: \u2018I had a miscarriage.

Fuller said the request had been rejected \u201con the basis of rules I put in place broadly on travel outside the state of NSW and I\u2019m 99% sure that was a state government edict in terms of travel\u201d. The document also revealed that police had discussed the option of having officers in SA take the woman\u2019s formal statement, or allowing her to do it remotely. Ultimately, neither option was pursued. NSW police said that on 2 April 2020 \u201cinvestigators had a conversation with the victim around the possibility of having the statement taken by a South Australian detective\u201d but she had \u201cexpressed concerns over this course of action and it was not pursued\u201d. \u201cOn 26 April 2020, a South Australian police detective spoke to victim and she no longer wanted to supply statement to them, preferring contact with [NSW] investigators,\u201d police said. A phone or video statement was also discussed but \u201cdue to the complexities of the statement that was required and in the interests of the mental health and wellbeing of the victim it was deemed not to be an appropriate manner in which the statement should be obtained\u201d, police said. \u2022 In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

Far from a household name in the UK, Oppo is part of BKK Electronics, which is one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world and operates brands OnePlus, Vivo and RealMe among others. The \u00a31,099 device leads Oppo\u2019s top Find X3 Android phone line for 2021 but it fails to justify its price, even with a very speedy recharging time of 31 minutes and a long battery life. On looks, the Find X3 Pro doesn\u2019t reinvent the wheel in design \u2013 a metal and glass sandwich with a full-screen front \u2013 but the back glass is moulded to encase the camera lump on the back, which is unusual.

The large 6.7in QHD+ OLED screen is bright, crisp and has a 120Hz refresh rate to make scrolling super smooth matching competitors. The curved sides and glass back make it one of the smoothest-feeling smartphones available, and its 74mm width and sub-200g weight make it easy to hold for a large phone.

It also has 30W wireless charging and reverse wireless charging. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    The Find X3 Pro has the latest top processor available for Android devices, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It performs very well indeed \u2013 the interface is snappy, apps are responsive and games fly. It also has very good battery life. With the screen set to its maximum QHD+ resolution and 120Hz frame rate, the phone lasts about 49 hours with the screen used for about 5.5 hours in various apps, meaning 7am on day one until 7am on day three. That includes two hours on 5G, the rest on wifi, an hour of Disney+ and about 20 photos shot. Sustainability Oppo rates the battery for at least 800 full charge cycles using its 65W SuperVOOC 2.0 system while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity.

Related: How we are changing the way we rate sustainability of consumer electronics    ColorOS 11.2     ColorOS is a fast and well-optimised version of Android, but its default colour scheme and icon design make it look a little dated compared to some competitors. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    ColorOS 11.2 is Oppo\u2019s heavily customised Android version, here based on Android 11. While it works more or less the same as Android versions from Google, OnePlus or Samsung, it looks a bit basic in its default colour scheme and design. If square icons and pastel green colour scheme aren\u2019t for you, the interface is highly customisable either with dedicated themes or just manual tweaks. The speed of animations can be changed as well as lots of gestures and navigation options. There\u2019s a \u201cpull-out tray\u201d for making using two apps on the screen a bit easier, plus ways to quickly launch apps using the in-screen fingerprint reader as a virtual joystick. Some oddities include the fact most notification icons do not appear in the status bar by default, and must be turned on per app and per notification type (such as for messages but not alerts). You have to tap on notifications to expand them, rather than pulling down on them. The gesture to quickly launch the camera while the phone is locked is a double-press of one of the volume buttons, which is common in China, but not in Europe or the US where it is usually a double-press of the power button. The phone also attempts to get you to sign up for an account with a firm called HeyTap, but doesn\u2019t explain why, who HeyTap is or the function it provides (it\u2019s a cloud services firm) or why you should trust it with your data. Oppo will only commit to supporting the Find X3 Pro with at least two years of software and security updates, including two new Android version updates, from release, which is simply not good enough. No one should be using devices that are no longer updated to keep their data safe. When most good competitors offer at least three years of updates, with Samsung offering four years and Apple at least five years for similar or lower-cost devices, two years is poor. It is a shame as ColorOS is a fast and well-optimised version of Android with little in the way of unwanted or duplicate apps. Camera     The camera app is fairly simple to use for point and shoot, but also has more advanced shooting options including a solid \u2018Pro\u2019 mode, 10-bit colour and portrait mode. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    On the back of the phone are four cameras, including a 50MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 13MP 2x telephoto and a 3MP \u201cmicrolens\u201d, which is a zoomed-in macro lens a bit like a microscope. The main and ultrawide 50MP cameras both have exactly the same image sensor, which is unusual, but means that you get very similar images shot by both cameras just with a different field of view. In good light, images are crisp, well balanced for colour and with good dynamic range. Low light performance is also solid, while video capture is pretty good too with interesting \u201cfilm modes\u201d, including at up to 8K at 30 frames a second, HDR and Log capture if you really want to try and shoot a bit more than a home movie. All these are things you should expect from a good main camera, but are far less common on an ultra-wide angle camera. The telephoto camera offers 2x optical or 5x hybrid. When used in good light it can shoot good photos at 2x with plenty of detail. The hybrid 5x zoom is decent, but is clearly digitally expanded when compared with competitors with real 5x optical zoom cameras. The Oppo often switches to a digital zoom on the main camera rather than use the 2x optical camera too, causing the viewfinder to jump as it switches cameras.     The macro camera has a little LED ring light around the lens that helps illuminate the subject at the super-close distances. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian    The macro camera is surprisingly fun allowing you take pictures of detail such as the individual fibres of a fabric that you can\u2019t see with the naked eye. You have to place the phone practically resting on top of your subject, but with a bit of patience you can produce some interesting almost microscopic images. Not something I\u2019d use much, but fun nonetheless. The 32-megapixel selfie camera can produce some good, highly detailed shots, and handles dim indoor lighting admirably. Overall, the camera on the Find X3 Pro is very good, but the lack of a really good zoom camera hurts it. Similarly priced competitors offer significantly better zooms of up to 10x optical. Observations     The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is one of the fastest available, matching that from OnePlus and the Galaxy S21 series for speed and accuracy. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian     The phone\u2019s haptic vibrations are generally nice and sharp, but some alerts can be a bit short and easy to miss, even with it turned up to maximum. Call quality and 5G performance on EE was excellent. The screen and back are covered in the older Gorilla Glass 5, not the latest significantly more shatter-resistant Gorilla Glass Victus  Price The Oppo Find X3 Pro will cost \u00a31,099 in black or blue, available from 14 April. For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra has an RRP of \u00a31,149, the Galaxy S21+ costs \u00a3819, the OnePlus 8 Pro costs \u00a3799 and the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max costs \u00a31,099. Verdict The Oppo Find X3 Pro is a really nice-feeling, high-performing smartphone that costs too much for what it offers and has guaranteed software support for only two years. The screen is great, the build is top-notch, it has the most powerful processor you can get in an Android phone, long battery life and incredibly fast charging. The camera is good too, but lack of a really good zoom camera hurts it when the phone costs \u00a31,099. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S21 Ultra, with an RRP of just \u00a350 more, has fantastic main and ultra-wide cameras plus a market-leading 5x and 10x optical zoom camera system and will be supported for four years. Apple\u2019s iPhone 12 Pro Max costs \u00a31,099 and will see in excess of five years of support. Two years of software support is simply not good enough, losing it a star on sustainability grounds.  Pros: great screen, top performance, long battery life, very fast charging, smooth build, sub-200g weight, good camera, water resistance, fast in-screen fingerprint scanner. Cons: lack of extended optical zoom for the camera, only two years of software support guaranteed, expensive.      The stereo speakers, which include the top handset speaker shown here, are pretty good for impromptu movie watching.

On the trail leading to the shore on tiny Seymour Island, noisily courting blue-footed boobies and frigate birds are equally unruffled by the presence of humans. Getting up close to the natural world without disturbing it seems as refreshingly easy on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands today as when Charles Darwin visited on HMS Beagle in 1835. Isolated from the mainland, the archipelago\u2019s unique endemic species \u2013 from giant tortoises to finches \u2013 helped Darwin set out his theory of evolution in On the Origin of Species.   Related: Chinese fishing armada plundered waters around Gal\u00e1pagos, data shows    One of the reasons the islands are such a hotbed of life is that the shallower, nutrient-rich waters around the volcanic atolls are fed by a confluence of cold and warm currents. This provides a refuge for an array of migratory ocean-going species, from scalloped hammerhead sharks to leatherback turtles. But it\u2019s also why industrial foreign fishing fleets lurk at the edge of the Ecuadorian archipelago\u2019s territorial waters. Nearly 250 vessels \u2013 243 of them Chinese flagged, including vast fishing boats and refrigerated container ships \u2013 have logged an astounding 73,000 hours of fishing a month and pulled up thousands of tonnes of squid and fish. Ecuadorian tuna boats are there, too: they circle the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve \u2013 an area of 133,000 sq km (51,000 sq miles) \u2013 and float hundreds of fish aggregation devices, or FADs. Conservationists have been sounding the alarm, saying that unprecedented pressure from overfishing, and excessive bycatch of sharks and other species, now threaten marine life in the world-renowned archipelago.

He must make longer fishing trips for smaller catches as he competes with huge factory ships near the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve. Photograph: Dan Collyns    Their concerns have led to a new proposal: an expansion of the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve area, wrapping another swathe of protected ocean from the north, east and south around it like a scarf. Speaking to the Guardian, Ecuador\u2019s president, Len\u00edn Moreno, said the proposal was based on his \u201cgovernment\u2019s strong commitment to conservation, the protection of the environment and, in particular, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u201d. It was the same commitment he had set out at the COP25 UN climate change conference in 2019, he said. Many conservation organisations are thrilled by the idea. \u201cIt is the first-ever smart proposal which benefits fishermen, biodiversity and reduces the impact of climate change,\u201d said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy project.   Map of Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2019 marine reserve zones The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands\u2019 marine reserve zones   But not everyone agrees. The plan \u2013 which Moreno has notably not yet approved \u2013 would extend the marine reserve to 445,953 sq km, more than three times the size of the existing protected area. It would also shut out Ecuador\u2019s larger tuna fishing boats from three-quarters of the archipelago\u2019s exclusive economic zone, extending for 200 nautical miles around the existing reserve. An exception would be made in the zone\u2019s south-western quarter, which would be set aside for \u201cresponsible fishing\u201d. Luigi Benincasa, executive director of Atunec, Ecuador\u2019s tuna fishing association, said the plan amounted to punishing local fishermen. \u201cWe must understand that a third of our catch, which we get in an exclusively Ecuadorian fishing zone, we won\u2019t have tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cHow is that beneficial [for us]?\u201d     A Gal\u00e1pagos penguin \u2013 the only penguin found in the tropics and the endemic to the islands Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana    Fishing on the western side of the archipelago, which is about 620 miles (1,000km) from continental Ecuador, would have an impact on profits at a time of economic hardship, said Benincasa. In the Pacific port of Manta, the tuna industry provides work for up to 200,000 people, he said. The tuna sector makes up the vast majority of the country\u2019s $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) fishing industry. \u201cWe would have to seek fishing grounds much further away with much greater fuel consumption, as well as having to compete with the international fleets,\u201d Benincasa added. Ecuador has the largest and most productive tuna fleet in the eastern Pacific region, and the second-largest in the world, with more than 100 purse-seine net tuna fishing boats and nearly as many long-liners. When it was created in 1998, the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve was the second largest in the world. Now it is number 33, outstripped in size and ambition by other South American nations such as Chile, which created the 740,000 sq km Rapa Nui marine reserve around Easter Island and has promised to protect more than 40% of its total marine territory. Meanwhile, Ecuador\u2019s tuna fishing fleet and the size of its catch have since more than doubled in size, says Eliecer Cruz, leader of M\u00e1s Gal\u00e1pagos, a local initiative to expand the reserve. Research shows fishing productivity has increased by 104% in the islands\u2019 exclusive economic zone this century. Whale sharks, great hammerhead sharks as well as leatherback turtles and waved albatross, have all become listed as critically endangered in the IUCN red list since 1998 as industrial-scale fishing has increased. They are among 14 marine migratory species found in the archipelago\u2019s waters \u2013 including Gal\u00e1pagos fur seals and sea lions \u2013 whose conservation status has worsened in the past two decades. (The range of the waved albatross extends to southern Chile but it only nests on the island of Espa\u00f1ola.) But even though only small-scale fishing is allowed in the marine reserve, larger vessels get around the ban by luring the fish outside the protected zone using FADs. Known locally as plantados, they are used to target tuna, but sweep up other pelagic fish such as shark, sailfish and marlin, and attract sea lions, dolphins and turtles before drifting out of the marine park. \u201cThe plantados keep on arriving [inside the reserve],\u201d said Cruz. \u201cThe bigger fishing boats of between 1,200 to 2,000 tonnes can cast 500 of them.\u201d Walter Borbor, an artisanal fisherman from Santa Cruz island who line-fishes for tuna, has come across many of the floating fish traps, which are basically wooden rafts with GPS trackers attached and nets hanging down for up to 100 metres.

Photograph: Jorge de la Quintana    \u201cThe big boats throw them outside the reserve knowing there\u2019s an infinity of currents that will carry them through and out again with a big shoal of smaller fish, which attract the bigger fish,\u201d Borbor shouted over the noise of the outboard engine on his eight-metre fibreglass boat. \u201cWe\u2019ve collected at least 30 plantados. We reuse the nets to make hammocks and chicken coops,\u201d he said. Pulling up a thrashing yellowfin tuna, the diminutive fisherman said he must make increasingly longer fishing trips for a smaller catch. \u201cSurrounding the islands there are many industrial boats that prevent the pelagic fish from coming in \u2013 they come here to spawn and to eat,\u201d Borbor said. \u201cThe spillover effect shows just how successful the marine reserve has been,\u201d said Norman Wray, president of the Gal\u00e1pagos governing council. \u201cBut now we need to expand it.\u201d Robust fish populations have attracted too much pressure, Wray said, not just from the national fleet but from foreign vessels, which fish intensively on the edge of the exclusion zone. Moreno must decide whether to commit to the reserve\u2019s expansion by signing a decree before he leaves office on 24 May. \u201cAn eventual increase in conservation measures in the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve would overlap with important areas of activity for the fishing sector, including artisanal fishing, with a possible negative impact for the national economy,\u201d the president said when asked if he planned to expand the reserve. \u201cFor that reason, any analysis should be comprehensive, including all the environmental and socioeconomic aspects.\u201d If Moreno does not sign the proposal into law, it could face a longer and more convoluted route, as a parliamentary committee on biodiversity and natural resources would have to decide whether it should be debated and voted on in the national assembly. Juan C\u00e1rdenas, an assembly member on the committee, said he backed the expansion proposal because of the islands\u2019 world heritage status. \u201cI understand the position of the fishermen but they are not the interests of our nation,\u201d he said. However, the powerful fishing industry is expected to exert its influence on Moreno and on whoever becomes the country\u2019s next leader. Benincasa, the tuna industry representative, argued that as a developing country Ecuador could not afford to give away more of its ocean to conservation. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be so naive,\u201d he said. Ecuador has signed up to the Global Ocean Alliance in support of the UK-led 30 by 30 initiative, an international commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean in protected marine areas by 2030. So far about 13% of Ecuador\u2019s waters are safeguarded. Conservationists hope further international support for the proposal to expand the Gal\u00e1pagos marine reserve could sway Moreno\u2019s decision. \u201cIt would be an incredible legacy to leave,\u201d said Cruz.", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "What happens if we're not interested in going to the shops when they reopen? | Andy Beckett", "full_article": "Under capitalism, shops are one of the places where our society is supposed to feel most alive. Window displays beckon. Products are piled high. Stock changes constantly. Desires are created and never quite satisfied. For most of the past year, shops in Britain \u2013 one of the economies most driven by consumerism \u2013 have not been like that at all. Even the grandest London department stores were often eerie places during the few months they were open last summer and autumn: customers sparse, staff trying to keep busy, the same goods on the shelves for much longer than normal. In its most physical form, British consumerism has slowed down and frequently ground to a halt. Online shopping seems to have been in the opposite state: rocketing sales, rushes for supermarket delivery slots. In many residential areas, delivery vans have been virtually the only traffic \u2013 for much of the day the only activity on the streets at all. The life of a neighbourhood reduced to the highly visible consumption habits of its inhabitants: it\u2019s a vision of modern Britain to make the most doctrinaire capitalists and Marxists feel vindicated. Meanwhile inside our homes, as lockdown efforts to self-improve have dwindled, browsing and buying on screens have become many people\u2019s default leisure activity, even more than before Covid. Hallways have filled up with parcels, just arrived or about to be returned. The home as stockroom: another example of consumerism penetrating deeper into our lives. Yet in other ways online shopping has slowed over the past year as well. In some areas badly hit by coronavirus, such as London and the West Midlands, postal deliveries have often been sluggish and erratic, as the increased number of parcels, social distancing in sorting offices and staff infections hamper Royal Mail. And since January, Brexit has added further obstructions: shipping delays and refusals, and unpredictable, often substantial, import charges for goods from the EU. The almost omnipotent feeling that online shopping used to give Britons with money, or the means to borrow it \u2013 that most of Europe was our shopping mall \u2013 has gone. As more and more people wake up to this, the consequences for the government may be awkward. More expensive and more bureaucratic shopping, with less choice, was not what leavers voted for. Last year, during the first lockdown, some people celebrated what they saw as the retreat of consumerism in favour of less individualistic and environmentally damaging pastimes. Some thought this retreat would be lasting. Yet instead, British consumerism is in a contradictory state: dramatically less visible in our town and city centres, but more important than ever in many of our heads. In a time of terrible loss, acquiring more possessions can be a small way of pushing back against the emptiness. The escape through consumption that capitalism has always promised has become something bigger, at least for some: a rare source of pleasure in lockdown, even a way of feeling more alive again. A lot of the people currently standing in cold, socially distanced queues for coffee, something they could make at home, are really trying to buy a shot of pre-Covid normality. A month from now, \u201cnon-essential\u201d shops will reopen in England, according to Boris Johnson\u2019s possibly reckless timetable. The government, optimistic economists such as the Bank of England\u2019s Andy Haldane, and many of the 10% of English employees who work or are on furlough in retail, are all hoping that money not spent during lockdown will start to be spent in shops on 12 April, and will help revive the economy as a whole. In the longer term, shops may lose their central retail role \u2013 John Lewis has just announced plans to shut stores \u2013 but this spring a lot of emotions are going to be invested in them. If customers stay away after the novelty of reopening wears off, we\u2019ll know that the psychological recovery from the virus has barely begun. Until 12 April, most shops will remain in a state of suspended animation. In the nonessential ones at my local shopping centre in north London, the lights are still on in display cabinets, winter sale stickers are still on windows, and most of the clothes rails are still full, but dust is gathering. A shirt I was thinking of buying before the current lockdown hangs tantalisingly out of reach. During the pandemic this frozen landscape, and the way it thwarts our desires, has become so familiar you can forget how strange and unprecedented it is. It\u2019s as if the quiet, rule-bound Sunday England that existed before the trading laws were liberalised a quarter of a century ago has returned and taken over the rest of the week as well. If you\u2019re uneasy about consumerism, all these closed shops can be calming, even inspiring \u2013 a glimpse of a society less dominated by commerce. But if you like the bustle and freedom of towns and cities, the sight of these once busy, semi-communal spaces now deserted and out of bounds can be unsettling \u2013 a possible future for much of Britain, as our lives shift increasingly from physical to digital space. And even our online shopping economy has vulnerabilities. Last May, the respected retail analyst Richard Hyman wrote on his blog: \u201cRetail entered this [coronavirus] crisis in bad shape. The industry was bloated with too many stores, too many websites \u2026\u201d After the pandemic, he continued, \u201cWe will have a materially smaller non-food sector.\u201d Behind that jargon lurk thousands of redundancies and abandoned premises. The great British shopping crisis is not over yet.

Governments don\u2019t want to gloat because it might mean admitting they knew all about certain events or attacks in advance but did nothing because they wanted to keep their asset in place to forestall some bigger situation. And the protest groups are angry and ashamed at the infiltration. And something desolate attaches to the long-term snitches themselves, who look horribly dysfunctional, like bigamists revealed to have a second wife and family. Sam Pollard\u2019s documentary MLK/FBI touched briefly on the supposedly loyal insiders within Martin Luther King\u2019s organisation who were secretly reporting to J Edgar Hoover \u2013 a subject so painful that it can still hardly be discussed.   Related: Sundance 2021: which films might break out this year?    Now there is this fiercely watchable and passionately performed drama from the director Shaka King, with barnstorming performances from Lakeith Stanfield and Daniel Kaluuya \u2013 about the Chicago Black Panther leader Fred Hampton who in 1969, at the age of 21, was cold-bloodedly shot at home during a raid by the FBI. The Bureau had been given inside information about the layout of his apartment by their snitch: Hampton\u2019s trusted security chief William O\u2019Neal, a former petty criminal who had been arrested and \u201cturned\u201d by the FBI man Roy Mitchell four years previously, and then instructed to rise up through the Black Panther ranks. O\u2019Neal had also drugged Hampton\u2019s drink so that he would be asleep or bleary during the raid and unable to escape.O\u2019Neal might be nothing more than a footnote, but this drama shrewdly and fascinatingly elevates him to equal status with Hampton \u2013 a diptych of tragic irony, the Judas to Hampton\u2019s messiah, a guy who had come up from the same streets as Hampton and might, if things had been different, had the same vocation. Daniel Kaluuya is Hampton himself, a little bulked up, and superbly conveying the muscular force of his charisma, his rhetoric and his instinctive leadership, and he brilliantly turns on the death-ray of Hampton\u2019s basilisk stare. And Stanfield gives us a career-best performance as poor William O\u2019Neal, wonderfully cast as the ordinary guy who gets in over his head: Stanfield\u2019s gentle face, often breaking into a slippery but charming smile, is enough to break your heart. Dominique Fishback is surely in line for a best supporting actress Oscar, with her sensitive, sympathetic performance as Fred\u2019s partner Deborah Johnson. Jesse Plemons is Roy Mitchell, the Bureau man \u201crunning\u201d O\u2019Neal and Martin Sheen has a returning cameo in heavy facial prosthetic as the creepy J Edgar himself.               But what a high-octane charge of excitement Kaluuya and Stanfield bring to the screen simply by showing up. There is something mesmeric about the way Hampton, with an almost Napoleonic confidence, faces everyone down with his searching gaze, and yet is boyishly shy with Deborah, and Fishback\u2019s contribution is so important for giving the audience access to the drama. As for Stanfield, he makes O\u2019Neal seem sympathetic or even romantic in his patently doomed career of treason: visibly thrilled to be taken out by Mitchell for a lavish steak-house lunch on the Bureau\u2019s tab or invited to Mitchell\u2019s house and allowed to drink his scotch; never in denial exactly, in fact excruciatingly aware of the danger, but never facing up to what he is doing. Yet the inevitable, terrible moment comes during a meal at Hampton\u2019s house \u2013 the last supper.Somehow, the Judas figure seems as important, almost more important than the Messiah: I found myself thinking of the Borges story, Three Versions Of Judas, in which Judas\u2019s destiny and significance is terrifyingly revealed to be much greater than anyone imagined. Like many biopics, this ends with a postscript \u2013 three or four stark sentences about the historical facts. It\u2019s a cliche, but Shaka King does something very unexpected with it: he begins with Lakeith Stanfield playing the older O\u2019Neal giving a TV interview in 1990 about his life, and ends with the real O\u2019Neal saying the same words \u2013 but there is a vicious sting in the tail. It\u2019s a powerful tale of human frailty.

Ministers have previously been criticised for not blocking the coalmine, particularly given that the UK is hosting Cop26, the UN climate summit, in November. A few weeks ago one of the country\u2019s most eminent environmental scientists, Sir Robert Watson, said it was \u201cabsolutely ridiculous\u201d the government was refusing to act. \nA notice from Jenrick\u2019s ministry to Cumbria county council said he was \u201ccalling in\u201d the planning application, citing \u201cfurther developments\u201d since he last considered the case including a report from the independent Committee on Climate Change, which advises the government on emissions targets. The council approved the mine, called Woodhouse Colliery, in October, and Jenrick refused to intervene at the time. Alok Sharma, the former business secretary put in charge of organising Cop26, was said to be furious at the decision to let it proceed. \nGreenpeace has hailed it as \u201cfantastic news and definitely better late than never\u201d. Friends of the Earth added it was a \u201cstartling, but very welcome U-turn\u201d, and urged the government to refuse permission for the project. \n* * * \n\u2018Bright and beautiful\u2019 \u2013 Relatives of Sarah Everard have spoken of their pain after police searching for the missing 33-year-old said they had found human remains. The marketing executive\u2019s family paid tribute to the \u201cbright and beautiful\u201d woman on Thursday and appealed for anyone with information about her disappearance to come forward to authorities. They described her as a \u201cwonderful daughter and sister\u201d, adding: \u201cShe was kind and thoughtful, caring and dependable. She always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n  Sarah Everard. \n  Photograph: Metropolitan police/AFP/Getty Images \n  \n \nThey added: \u201cShe was strong and principled and a shining example to us all. We are very proud of her and she brought so much joy to our lives. We would like to thank our friends and family for all their support during this awful time and we would especially like to thank Sarah\u2019s friends who are working tirelessly to help. We are so grateful to the police and would like to thank them for all they are doing. We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the police if you have any information. No piece of information is too insignificant. Thank you.\u201d \nMeanwhile Reclaim These Streets, which wants to hold a vigil on Saturday evening close to where Everard disappeared, has said it was told by police that it would be unlawful. The Met said in a statement last night that it understood \u201cthe public\u2019s strength of feeling \u2026 We remain in discussion with the organisers about this event in light of the current Covid regulations.\u201d The Labour MP Harriet Harman said she had written to the Met to back the event, adding: \u201cParliament has not specifically acted to constrain the right to demonstrate, so long as social distancing is observed this vigil will be perfectly lawful.\u201d \n* * * \nMet faces inquiry over Everard suspect \u2013 The Metropolitan police is to face an inquiry into whether it properly investigated a claim of indecent exposure involving the suspect in the alleged murder of Sarah Everard. PC Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Everard. He has also been arrested on suspicion of an indecent exposure involving another woman, and this is the incident that will be investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The alleged indecent exposure happened on 28 February at a fast food restaurant in south London. Everard disappeared after leaving a friend\u2019s house in the south of the capital at about 9pm on 3 March to walk home. \n* * * \nArts rescue fund slow to pay out \u2013 A government fund established to prop up the arts and heritage sectors during the coronavirus pandemic has handed over little more than half of the money it has allocated, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has discovered. The National Audit Office said the culture recovery fund had budgeted for \u00a3830m in grants and loans funding so far, but only \u00a3495m had been paid out. MPs have responded angrily to the findings, urging the government to hand over the cash while \u201cthere are still organisations left to support\u201d. London has received 31% of total revenue grant funding, followed by the north-west and the south-east of England, which each received 12%, auditors said. \n* * * \n\u2018Pass the domestic abuse bill\u2019 \u2013 Boris Johnson has come under concerted pressure to take action to tackle male violence and misogyny and make the UK safer for women. During the annual International Women\u2019s Day debate in the House of Commons dozens of female MPs have told moving and angry stories of harassment. The Labour MP Jess Phillips read out the names of 118 women killed by men since last year\u2019s debate. \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe Lib Dems\u2019 Wendy Chamberlain urged the government to make misogyny a hate crime. \u201cPass the domestic abuse bill \u2013 it\u2019s been in the offing for four years,\u201d she said. There is cross-party pressure to use the crime and sentencing bill to take tougher action on crimes against women, when the wide-ranging legislation returns to the House of Commons next week. The government is yet to publish a long-promised strategy on tackling violence against women and girls. The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said on Thursday that ministers hoped to do so by the end of the year. \n* * * \n\u2018No place for us to go\u2019 \u2013 Residents in the Yemeni province of Marib are bracing for what could be the worst mass displacement of the war as a Houthi rebel offensive intensifies, leaving more than 2 million people trapped including many displaced by the conflict from elsewhere. The frontline is getting closer to Marib city, an oil-rich desert town 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, Sana\u2019a, that was home to approximately 400,000 people before the war. Its population has swollen to about 2.7 million because of people fleeing fighting elsewhere in the country. \n \n  \n  \n  Yemeni soldiers ride on the back of a patrol truck. \n  Photograph: Ali Owidha/Reuters \n  \n \nThere are 138 poorly serviced displacement camps in the area \u2013 five have been abandoned and their residents relocated since February, according to the Marib Girls Foundation. Hamas al-Muslimi, a student who has lived in Marib for several years, said: \u201cThe fighting is just a few kilometres away now \u2026 but there is no other place for us to go.\u201d Joe Biden is pushing for the resumption of UN-sponsored talks to end the conflict. Marib is the Yemeni government\u2019s only northern stronghold: its fall would greatly weaken their negotiating position and derail diplomatic efforts to end the war. \n* * * \nWorld may be at \u2018peak twin\u2019 \u2013 Twin births may be more common today than at any time in history, according to the first comprehensive global survey in the field. Researchers looked at more than 100 countries and found for every 42 people born, one is a twin, which adds up to 1.6 million children a year. The global twin birthrate has risen by one-third, on average, over the past 40 years. But the world may have reached \u201cpeak twin\u201d, the authors say, as the most recent data suggest some countries have begun to see rates plateau or fall. While the birthrate for identical twins \u2013 created when a single fertilised egg splits \u2013 has barely changed, researchers found an increase in naturally conceived, non-identical twins, as well as twins born as a result of medically assisted reproduction. Most now are born as a result of fertility treatments. \nToday in Focus podcast: Freeing Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe \nNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has endured a five-year nightmare after being arrested and jailed in Iran while on holiday.

Many of us found dust on our cars, and Alpine snow has been stained orange, but finding out how much Saharan dust we are breathing has always been difficult. For decades we have been measuring the amount of particle pollution in the air, but not what it is made of. However, university-run air observatories in London, Birmingham and Manchester are now making real-time chemical analysis. They showed that silicon, aluminium, calcium and iron particles from Saharan dust were the main particle pollutants in all three cities on Saturday 20 February and that the dust was breathed by Londoners for the next two days. Saharan dust events are common in Mediterranean countries. It is also carried west on Atlantic trade winds. Dust from north Africa fertilises the Amazon, but it also causes air pollution problems in Caribbean islands and the southern US. Desert dust is not like builder\u2019s sand; it contains many biological particles and allergens. A recent study in Miami found increased hospital visits for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease during Saharan dust events. Other studies have found problems for asthmatics, too. In June 2020 authorities in Cuba asked islanders to wear face masks and urged vulnerable people to stay indoors as a massive Saharan dust cloud travelled westwards. Alerting systems are being established across Spain and Portugal but there is need for more research into the health impacts of desert dust. Saharan dust can have a major effect on weather systems, suppressing hurricane formation and, by darkening snow, bringing forward spring thaws in the Alps. It is unclear if events will increase in the future. A dryer climate in north Africa may lead to more airborne dust but changes in weather patterns may reduce its spread. However, alpine ice cores covering the past two millennia suggests that Saharan dust has increased in the past 100 years. Also notable in the ice core record are the Saharan dust events between 1315 and 1365, a time that includes the Great Famine, when about 10% of Europe\u2019s population perished, and the Black Death. This has led to speculation that poor air quality from Saharan dust may have contributed to a decline in human health and made the population more vulnerable.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "As Covid turns the crisis of social care into a calamity, the government does nothing | Polly Toynbee", "full_article": "A ghoulish figure was hidden away on page 135 of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s report on budget day last week. The 125,000 deaths from Covid so far will save the Treasury \u00a31.5bn in state pensions by 2022; savings will continue to be made during all the years those people should have lived. That shocking death toll brings in more inheritance tax revenues, too. But those deaths are another blow to social care providers. A substantial proportion of the people who have died so far lived in care homes, and they have left empty beds and an even deeper financial hole. Occupancy dropped from over 90% to around 70%, according to Martin Green of Care England, and families are now more reluctant to put relatives into homes. This week, the National Audit Office has warned that 94% of councils will have to cut spending, and social care is the biggest slice of their stricken budgets. On Wednesday, Care England called on the chancellor not to axe relief funds on 1 April: the fund pays (inadequately) towards testing, infection control and extra staff in an industry with an estimated 100,000 shortfall. The Health Foundation says restoring care even to the meagre levels of 2010 would cost \u00a312.5bn.  In other words, a crisis is becoming a calamity. Yet the chancellor said nothing on social care in the budget. Does it matter how many protest? Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, was vehement in his evidence to the Commons health committee this week that an urgent solution to social care and its staff shortages is needed. How can the forthcoming NHS bill create integrated care systems between the two services when the NHS is free but social care is means-tested? Some say Boris Johnson never had that \u201cclear plan we have prepared\u201d he promised on the steps of Downing Street. Others say there was one, but political advisers blenched at this wicked issue, where every solution involves political pain: either pay more tax, make older people pay a lump sum or a lien on their home on retirement, pay compulsory insurance, make young working people pay for property-rich older people, or lose inheritances in care charges? All would be seismically shocking to voters, few of whom know how paying for care works until their family is suddenly hit by the cost of it. The chancellor disingenuously called for \u201ccross-party\u201d working, but Liz Kendall, the shadow care minister, says: \u201cThis has not been discussed or even raised with Labour\u2019s frontbench team, despite our repeatedly asking the care minister about this issue.\u201d It\u2019s a smokescreen to blame Labour later. Why not submit his entire budget to \u201ccross-party\u201d agreement? That\u2019s not how politics works. When he was health secretary, Andy Burnham put up the only good plan \u2013 drawn up in a cross-party committee \u2013 from any recent government: on retirement, everyone with the means would pay a lump sum, or place a lien on their home, and thereafter care would be free. But just before the 2010 election, David Cameron withdrew Tory support so he could blast it as a \u201cdeath tax\u201d. Cynical electioneering trumped consensus. Ever since Margaret Thatcher privatised it, social care has been a hotchpotch of companies running homes and services. Some make a fat profit, as Caroline Abrahams, head of Age UK, points out; a luxury Surrey home for private clients can cost \u00a33,000 a week, while some big companies with highly leveraged debt and property financing put their profits in offshore tax havens. On the other hand, small operators such as Mike Padgham, who runs four St Cecilia homes in Scarborough, rely on private residents to cross-subsidise the paltry sum councils pay for those who are state-funded. At one point in the pandemic, the occupancy rate at Padgham\u2019s homes dropped to 60%, and the chancellor\u2019s withdrawal of Covid relief funding on 1 April is a disaster. Covid is not over. \u201cWhere is Matt Hancock\u2019s \u2018Care\u2019 badge, when he claimed social care was equal to the NHS,\u201d asks Padgham. \u201cI think he only wore it once.\u201d The government appears to have forgotten its promise to equalise the pay, training and esteem of care and NHS workforces. Don\u2019t hold your breath for any plan, despite yet another \u201clater this year\u201d promise. Despite nightly TV pictures of heroic care workers, despite claps for carers, despite the deaths of many care staff, social care is a secret world. Here\u2019s the hard political truth: social care features nowhere in the top 10 of Ipsos Mori\u2019s regular Issues Index. The public are mostly clueless about its financing until they encounter the nasty shock of putting a relative in a home, and finding the cost falls on their inheritances. Andrew Dilnot, author of the official government report on the issue 10 years ago, says: \u201cWe know how to do this, we just need to get on and do it.\u201d What will it take? Social care collapse is already here in worsening council finances. While nurses\u2019 pay is political dynamite, hundreds of thousands of frail people are denied the care they would have had a decade ago, left home alone and hidden from view.

In December, it was reported that the standup comic/actor/campaigner/endurance runner had adopted the pronouns \u201cshe\u201d and \u201cher\u201d and wanted to be \u201cbased in girl mode\u201d from now on. Well, it hardly came out of the blue, she says today. Izzard had spent the past 35 years building up to it, and when she did finally make the announcement it happened by chance. A few months earlier, Izzard had been a guest on the Sky Arts series Portrait Artist Of the Year, and was asked, for the first time, which pronouns she preferred. She replied \u201cshe and her\u201d and never gave it another thought. By the time the programme was broadcast, Izzard had forgotten about the conversation. And suddenly she was headline news. The funny thing, Izzard says, is that she had first announced she was trans in 2017 in the Hollywood Reporter and nobody had taken a blind bit of notice. But this time it was different. Within hours of the show being broadcast everything had changed \u2013 her Wikipedia entry and IMDb history were revised, and every media organisation was running stories about how he had become a she. Actually, Izzard says, she had not intended to be so definitive about it. She had always talked about being in boy mode most of the time and girl mode part of the time, and she was still hoping to keep her options open. For her first half century, boy mode had dominated, and now it was time for girl mode to take centre stage, but on occasions she would still like the freedom to be a he. She soon discovered that wasn\u2019t an option, though.     Izzard doing standup at the Boulevard Theatre\u2019s Raging Bull club night in the late 80s. Photograph: -    Take, for example, the new Netflix series she is currently working on in Manchester. In the adaptation of Harlan Coben\u2019s thriller Stay Close, Izzard plays a small-town lawyer called Harry. \u201cAs I\u2019m playing a male role, I suggested people should go back to calling me he and him for this, and what the world seems to have said to me is you can change your pronouns but you can\u2019t use he and him as well. You\u2019ve just got to be she and her from now on because we\u2019ve only got so much time on our hands, thank you very much.\u201d How does she feel about that? She beams. \u201cGreat. I\u2019ve been promoted to she, and it\u2019s a great honour.\u201d    I\u2019ve been promoted to she, and it\u2019s a great honour    The thing is, she says, when she first came out as a transvestite in 1985, she was pretty much making the same statement she is now. For Izzard it was never just about having a thing for dresses and high heels, it was always about identifying as female. As far as she was concerned, being a transvestite simply meant being transgender without physically transitioning. She says she was four years old when she first had an inkling that she was transgender, even if she had no words for it back then. Izzard is big on self-analysis. Read her memoir Believe Me, and the two most important dates are dissected time and again \u2013 first, when Izzard was six and her beloved mother died, and second, the day she first stepped out in a frock and lippy. Both shaped her future. After her mother\u2019s death she realised she would never again feel so lost and betrayed by the world. Everything she has done since then, she says, has been for her mother \u2013 not only to make her proud, but also in the hope of somehow bringing her back. Meanwhile, coming out at the age of 23 was the toughest thing she has done. It emboldened her as much as it terrified her \u2013 from then on she knew she could take on anything because nothing would be so scary.              Today we are Zooming to discuss her new movie \u2013 an entertaining if rickety second world war spy thriller, in which Izzard stars alongside Judi Dench. Six Minutes to Midnight is yet another first for Izzard \u2013 her debut as a screenwriter. The film is very loosely based on a remarkable true story about a tiny girls\u2019 school in Bexhill-on-Sea (one of a number of places Izzard grew up in as the family regularly moved because of her father\u2019s job with British Petroleum) whose students were all German, including daughters of the Nazi high command. But Izzard being Izzard, the movie is hardly the only thing on her mind. Yes, acting is her priority at the moment, but she is also planning a standup tour of Spain in Spanish. Then there is her solo performance of Dickens\u2019s Great Expectations, which she hopes to take to the US. Oh yes, and in January she raised more than \u00a3300,000 for charity by doing 32 virtual marathons and 31 standup gigs in 31 days. Her appetite for ever more audacious challenges is as huge as her ambition to succeed. And finally there is politics. Izzard tells me she is planning to win a seat for Labour at the next general election, and if by some quirk she fails to she will stand again and again till she does win. There have been few performers with the stamina or self-belief of Eddie Izzard. I tell her I\u2019m exhausted just listening to her itinerary. Doesn\u2019t she get knackered? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. Again, it goes back to the early days. From the age of seven, she was desperate to act, but she never got chosen for anything. So she insinuated herself into school plays \u2013 when the cast were rehearsing Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, she hovered by, uninvited, and when the drama teacher wanted a table moving she would move it. Her persistence paid off when she was given one line in the musical. At the age of 15 she broke into Pinewood Studios in the hope that somebody would spot her potential. Nobody did, and she was turfed out. At school she already had that hunger to achieve and impress. She was expected to do nine O-levels, but opted for 12.     \u2018There was 23 years of twiddling my thumbs\u2019 \u2026 Izzard performing in 1996. Photograph: David Corio/Getty Images    Alongside her outre persona, there has always been something rather conservative about Izzard. As a teenager she wanted to join the special forces (till she discovered she couldn\u2019t pick and choose her wars), and believed strongly in moderation and the rule of law. One of her favourite expressions is \u201ccool and groovy\u201d, and never does she sound more establishment than when she says it. She studied sciences at A-level, started a degree in accounting at the University of Sheffield and left a year later to pursue a career as a street performer.    I went through such hell since \u201985 that the idea that I\u2019ve come out recently just sounds ridiculous    She honed her comedic skills by talking to (often imaginary) audiences on the streets as an escapologist. Inspired by the Goons and Monty Python, she developed her own brand of stream of consciousness riffing. Izzard\u2019s humour is a form of mental contortionism, twisting crazy concepts one way then another before reaching even more half-baked conclusions. She never made any headway till establishing herself as a standup comic at the age of 30. And this, she says, is why nothing exhausts her now. \u201cI was seven and I was ready to go. So there were 23 years of twiddling my thumbs waiting for things to get going. And when it did get going I thought I\u2019m way behind, I\u2019ve got to catch up.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI realise now if I go towards things slowly they tend to work.\u201d While many transgender people suffer terrible gender dysphoria because they believe they have been born into the wrong sex, Izzard continued to seesaw between girl mode and boy mode. Perhaps because of this there has been a tendency to dismiss her as attention-seeking or whimsical. But she insists this could not be less true. In January, she told the Big Issue: \u201cI went through such hell since \u201985 that the idea that I\u2019ve come out recently just sounds ridiculous.\u201d     Izzard at the opening of the Bravehearts: Men in Skirts exhibition in New York City, 2003. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex Features    Can she describe that hell? \u201cThere\u2019s the self-analysis I did lying on the bed with the curtains closed trying to walk through my mental passageways, and my brain not letting me do it. Then there\u2019s the coming out \u2013 the people hurling the abuse, and what do you do. And then there\u2019s the panic attacks that happened most days, several times a day. You start sweating, and if it\u2019s in the summer months and you\u2019re panicking, you bucket with sweat and you think: \u2018My God, I\u2019m sweating.\u2019 So you sweat even more.\u201d The panic attacks only stopped a few years ago. Izzard shows me how people used to laugh in her face. She moves her face forward so she is virtually headbutting the screen. \u201cPeople would stand this close, and say: \u2018What the fuck is that? What the fuck is that?\u2019 They turn you into an it.\u201d Did it scare her? \u201cNo, it infuriated me. I want to fight everyone that says things like that.\u201d There is another fight, though, that she thinks is utterly pointless \u2013 between some trans women and some feminists. She believes they should be allies rather than enemies. \u201cIt saddens me. How do we change that conversation? I can\u2019t come up with a magic wand and provide an answer for everyone. I\u2019m just trying to create a space for myself and anybody else who wants to slipstream behind that. But if you sat me down with some radical feminists I\u2019m not sure whether we would sort everything out.\u201d She thinks it\u2019s a waste of political energy. \u201cI\u2019d like to get to the place where we don\u2019t have to have this fight because I\u2019m trying to deal with rightwing fascists and what they say.\u201d     With Judi Dench in Six Minutes to Midnight. Photograph: Film PR Handout    Izzard, aged 58, is dressed soberly in a shirt and jacket, and could easily pass as a politician. In fact, she says this is how she will dress when (not if) she wins her seat. Has she talked to Labour about standing in the next election? \u201cYes, I\u2019ve told everybody that I can tell that I want to stand. But still, a lot of other people want to stand, so nothing is a given.\u201d Is she as determined about this as she has been about her standup, acting and running? \u201cYep. I\u2019m not mucking about with this. I\u2019m going in. If something goes wrong, if I stand in a byelection and I don\u2019t get in, I\u2019ll still go on. It doesn\u2019t really matter because I am a relentless bastard.\u201d She\u2019s had to be, she says \u2013 after all, she has chosen the path of most resistance in everything she has pursued. So after climbing to the top of the standup mountain she walked back down and started again at the bottom of the acting mountain. And now, having made a respectable career for herself in acting, she is preparing to give it all up for Westminster.    If moderate people don\u2019t go into politics then you leave it to egotistical extremists who are happy to lie    Why is it so important for her to go into politics? \u201cIf moderate people don\u2019t go into politics then you leave it to egotistical extremists who are happy to lie. Moderates have got to go in. I\u2019m a radical and a moderate.\u201d In what way? \u201cI do radical things, but my politics are moderate. I perform in French, German and Spanish as well as English when I\u2019m a standup, so that\u2019s slightly radical. And I\u2019m radical because I came out as transgender. I\u2019ve run about 130 marathons for charity. That\u2019s slightly radical.\u201d     \u2018I do radical things but my politics are moderate\u2019 \u2026 speaking at a Labour election rally, 2015. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    Why does she do all the marathons \u2013 are they an obsession? Again she returns to her early life and trans issues. \u201cNo. It\u2019s more feeling I never did enough when I was younger.\u201d How has running changed her? \u201cIt\u2019s been great for my mental health. Great for reclaiming the sort of fitness I had as a kid. It\u2019s also changed people\u2019s attitude towards me, too \u2013 being a trans person who is an endurance runner is no bad thing.\u201d In what way? \u201cPeople don\u2019t expect a trans woman to be able to run 130 marathons for charity and it changes their sense of what a trans woman is. I can see in their eyes they go: well, fair play.\u201d    Relationships with me are tricky. You\u2019ve got to be a woman who\u2019s very self-confident about your  sexuality    In so many ways, she is bursting with self-belief. But Izzard says she has never found relationships easy. As a kid, she struggled to make an impression on girls she fancied. When she grew up, it didn\u2019t improve much. And now as an out trans woman she reckons it may get a whole lot harder. \u201cRelationships with me are tricky. You\u2019ve got to be a woman who\u2019s very self-confident about your own sexuality to go out with me.\u201d There have been few relationships in her adult life, partly because she is so often on the road working or running, partly because she is happy with her own company. Does she prefer not being in a relationship? \u201cI don\u2019t think I prefer it but I\u2019m not going to agonise over it.\u201d I ask if it\u2019s easier to be a trans woman now that she\u2019s getting older. \u201cIt\u2019s true older men and older women look quite a lot similar. There\u2019s a middle area where it\u2019s much trickier. Visually, there\u2019s not so much difference between older men and older women, so it does get easier.\u201d     Izzard running for Sport Relief, 2009. Photograph: Alfie Hitchcock / Rex Features    Is she worried that transitioning may harm her career? After all, she worked so hard to be recognised as an actor, and now casting directors may well be unsure what to do with her. \u201cYes, potentially, but that was there already. So yes, it is a thought, and a lot of people wouldn\u2019t come out because they felt that was going to screw up their career.\u201d Again, she says she has been astonished by some reactions. \u201cSome people are going: \u2018Are you serious?\u2019 I have floated this thing up as slowly as I fucking can. Thirty-five fucking years, mate, how much warning do you need?\u201d But she says she has had plenty of practice taking on hecklers on stage and in real life. \u201cI was the right person to come out because if people were going to hurl abuse at me in the streets, as they have done, I would hurl it back. Sometimes it would just be us standing in the street swapping abuse or if they fight me, I\u2019ll fight them back.\u201d At the moment, Izzard is self-identifying as a trans woman. Does she think she will ever physically transition? \u201cI might do. I feel that boy mode has had a good innings in this one life that we get. It would be great to get up in the morning and think I look like a woman so I\u2019m going to throw on a tracksuit and have breakfast. It is getting better and better. I do feel I can express myself in a more feminine way, which may be the age thing.\u201d Would she like boobs? \u201cYeah! I\u2019ve had boob envy since my teens. Just when teenage girls of my age were going \u2018I want boobs\u2019, I was thinking yeah me too. But I couldn\u2019t say it. They talk about penis envy, and I believe some women suffer penis envy. I cannot for the life of me get my head around this. But yes, I\u2019ve always had breasts envy.\u201d We\u2019re coming to the end of our time. As she talks, I\u2019m thinking how she has grown into her face over the years. Her features seems softer and more feminine these days. I ask if she is taking hormone pills. She smiles and, for once, declines to answer. \u201cI\u2019m very happy to transition and I feel I have been transitioning,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do feel I\u2019ve told everybody everything in my life, so I\u2019m going to keep a certain amount of privacy.\u201d \u2022 Six Minutes to Midnight is available on Sky Cinema and Now TV from 26 March. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2021 to change a reference to body dysmorphia to gender dysphoria.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "UK arts rescue fund has paid out just over half of money allocated", "full_article": "A government fund established to prop up the arts and heritage sectors during the coronavirus pandemic has handed over little more than half of the money it has allocated, Whitehall\u2019s spending watchdog has discovered. \nThe National Audit Office said the culture recovery fund had budgeted for \u00a3830m in grants and loans funding so far, but only \u00a3495m had been paid out. \nMPs have responded angrily to the findings, urging the government to hand over the cash while \u201cthere are still organisations left to support\u201d. \nThe Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) announced the \u00a31.57bn fund to help the cultural, arts and heritage institutions survive the pandemic last summer. \nIt has supported about 3,000 arts organisations in England so far, including venues such as the Royal Albert Hall and Southbank Centre in London, and M&amp;S Bank Arena in Liverpool. \n \n  \n  \n   default\n  \n  \n \nThe fund was increased by \u00a3300m in the budget earlier this month, with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s such a relief we can look ahead now so this funding is not just about survival but for planning and preparing for the reopening of theatres, galleries and gigs.\u201d \nBut auditors have examined the allocation of the funds so far and found that of the \u00a31bn that has been made available, about \u00a3830m in grants and loans has been awarded to different organisations but only \u00a3495m of that has been paid out, auditors said. \nThe department has assumed, in the worst-case scenario, that social distancing would remain until the end of March this year, auditors pointed out, and that demand for theatre tickets and venue capacity would remain at 40% of pre-Covid-19 levels. \nBut the current situation exceeds this worst-case scenario. \nMeg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, urged payments to arms-length bodies to be sped up. \n\u201cMany across the sector will have welcomed the funding announced last summer. But eight months later, more than half of the \u00a31bn made available so far is still waiting in the wings. \n\u201cWith the sector\u2019s shutdown already past government\u2019s worst-case scenario, DCMS needs to get support out to organisations while there are still organisations left to support,\u201d she said. \nThursday\u2019s report said the DCMS aimed to support the survival of 75% of the organisations in the sector at risk during 2020-21. \nMuseums, galleries, cinemas, music venues and theatres had to close in March last year when the UK entered the first national lockdown. Some reopened partially in the summer and autumn but many have remained entirely or mostly closed for nearly a year. \n \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\" Callout callout-coronavirus \"> \n \nThe DCMS predicted that without targeted support organisations would run out of money around the end of September 2020, the report said. \nThe department has not yet paid out any money from the second phase of funding, totalling \u00a3400m, comprised of funding not awarded in the first funding phase plus \u00a3258m that it held back as contingency. \nLondon has received 31% of total revenue grant funding, followed by the north-west and the south-east of England, which each received 12%, auditors said. \nResponding to the report, a DCMS spokesperson said: \u201cIt is right that we get funding out quickly with the safeguards taxpayers would expect to see in such a huge investment, and much more money has been invested into the sector since this report was compiled. \u201cApplications are being processed for a \u00a3400m second round of grants and loans, and an additional \u00a3300m announced at the Budget will help the hardest hit reopen and recover.

Plastic tree guards wrapped around saplings, a corrugated metal dam blocking a brook, three bat boxes pinned to a Scots pine. Beneath my feet, where the rich, black soil oozes with the overflow of feeder streams, logs have been buried for stability before the path finally transforms into a boardwalk. From this elevation, you get a good view of the latest construction project: a robust fence, angled to protect what\u2019s inside. On the other side of the fence live some effective subcontractors, a pair of beavers brought in to manage the environment with their traditional tools of tooth and claw. They were reintroduced to Cheshire three months ago, and have had a wet welcome, thanks to the rainiest winter in 21 years. The county claims to have more ponds than any other in England, and a wealth of watery habitats, so it\u2019s hoped the beavers will feel right at home. I heard that the beavers patrol their perimeter after dark, so I plan a dusk visit. In the creation of the compound, some trees have been cleared from the edges for security. They now lie in piles, conveniently providing the beavers with food and fodder. But in the fading light I struggle to recognise much from the tantalising videos released by the Cheshire Wildlife Trust, which manages the project. Clips from within the enclosure show slick trails made by beaver tummies and tails, branches gnawed to expose the white inner bark, a lodge freshly burrowed under brambles and covered with twigs, and possibly the beginnings of their first canal to link two ponds. These workers certainly haven\u2019t been slouching through the wet weather,; hard graft is going on out of public view. I strain my senses for some evidence, and I can just hear the water trickle through the ditch between the boardwalk and the beaver fence, now accompanied by a blackbird in melodious voice. I stay long enough to hear nature\u2019s shift change: mallards blast their calls as they commute overhead and a male tawny owl begins to woo.

Many, like Obinna, continue to live in the rubble of their demolished compounds, with nowhere else to go. The port authority and the navy units that carry out the evictions accuse residents of either stealing oil from the pipelines that run beneath the waterways or turning a blind eye to the theft, thereby depriving the city\u2019s coffers of revenues.     A month after the demolitions began, Lagos\u2019s government announced its intention to build a tourist resort on Tarkwa Bay. Photograph: Emmanuel Akinwotu    But residents say the accusations are a smokescreen, and that the real reason for the evictions is to clear valuable seafront expanses for luxury commercial developments and beachfront getaways for the middle class, which have sprung up across the islands. A month after the demolitions began, Lagos\u2019s government announced its intention to build a tourist resort on Tarkwa Bay. Across the water, on sand dredged from the sea, a handful of skyscrapers mark the site of Eko Atlantic, an enormous and controversial \u201cprivate city\u201d development off the coast of Victoria Island. According to the Justice Empowerment Initiative, a Lagos-based organisation that provides training and resources for people in poor communities, tens of thousands of people, several with roots going back generations on the islands have been displaced from Tarkwa Bay and nearby islands. Many \u2013 like Obinna \u2013 are migrants and refugees from along the west African coast.   Lagos map   Some have moved to other islands where demolitions are less frequent, others to informal settlements on the mainland, where by some estimates two-thirds of the city\u2019s population of 15 million live. The prevalence of the informal settlements is a direct result of a lack of affordable housing: social housing is virtually nonexistent, and exorbitant private rents are beyond the means of many. The navy says all evictions take place after adequate notice is given, but this is heavily disputed by residents and campaigners who say they take place suddenly and in defiance of property rights. In January 2020, the high court ruled in a case brought by several communities against the navy and the Nigerian government that the demolitions must stop, but they continue regardless. Mohammed Zanna lived on Tarkwa Bay for 12 years in a small room attached to a home before it was demolished last year.

Photograph: Emmanuel Akinwotu    Taibat Lawanson, an associate professor of urban planning at the University of Lagos, said low-income communities have paid the price of every attempt by local authorities to expand and develop the city. The problem stems in part from antiquated, unreformed land ownership laws dating from the 1970s. Land and property is sold and leased in a range of ways, Lawanson said, and many poor people do not have the proof of ownership that authorities often demand before proceeding with evictions. \u201cMany people are unable to move from holding a receipt (for their land) to having the land officially registered with the state government,\u201d Lawanson said. \u201cWhen they do, they have to go through this process of ratification, which is essentially buying the land twice. \u201cThe challenge that low-income communities have is that they lack political capital, they don\u2019t have influence, and their land is usually located in a place that has economic potential beyond its current use.\u201d Obinna, who fled to Lagos from Liberia in the 1970s, recalls the moment she lost her home. \u201cThey brought a caterpillar and levelled everything just like that,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t give any notice.

Marib, which is controlled by parties loyal to the Yemeni government, has faced intermittent attacks from rebel forces over the last year as the Houthis have steadily gained ground in the area. A renewed assault since last month, however, has quickly morphed into one of the most ferocious battles of the seven-year-old war. The frontline is getting closer to Marib city \u2013 a development that threatens to exacerbate what is already the worst humanitarian crisis in the world and severely undercut the peace process.   Related: UK 'balancing books on backs of Yemen's starving people', says UN diplomat    Ballistic missiles, drones and other projectiles are hammering the town and its outskirts, while the Saudi-led coalition supporting the Yemeni government has stepped up bombing of Houthi positions across the country. Estimates vary widely but several hundred combatants and scores of civilians are believed to have been killed in the violence. Marib, an oil-rich desert town 75 miles (120km) east of the capital, Sana\u2019a, was home to approximately 400,000 people before the war. Since local forces managed to fend off an initial Houthi attack in 2015, however, the area has been seen as a safe haven for those fleeing fighting elsewhere in the country, and its population has swollen to about 2.7 million. There are 138 poorly serviced displacement camps in the area, some of which have been hit in the recent violence. Five camps have been abandoned and their residents relocated since February, Yasmin al-Qadhi, the head of the Marib Girls Foundation, said in a media briefing on Wednesday.   Graphic     Hamas al-Muslimi, a student who has lived in Marib for several years, said: \u201cWe are worried the fighting is going to head towards another bad turn. It\u2019s very unstable. The fighting is just a few kilometres away now \u2026 but there is no other place for us to go.\u201d Yemen\u2019s war broke out in 2014 after the Houthis stormed Sana\u2019a, causing the president to flee to neighbouring Saudi Arabia in early 2015. It escalated sharply when a coalition of Arab nations led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened to oust the Iran-backed rebels. The coalition, which is supported and armed by western nations including the UK, has been widely criticised for bombing campaigns that have indiscriminately targeted civilian infrastructure, and for a blockade of Yemen\u2019s airspace, borders and ports that has helped drive half of the 29-million-strong population into hunger. The Houthis have imposed repressive pseudo-religious rules on people living in areas under their control, the latest of which involves restricting women\u2019s access to birth control. They are routinely accused of detaining and torturing dissidents and of siphoning off aid. The escalation in Marib appears to have been triggered by the withdrawal of Saudi troops from the area last year. Most of the conflict\u2019s other frontlines \u2013 notably in the cities of Taiz and Hodeidah \u2013 have largely been static for years. \u201cThe battles [elsewhere in Yemen] have stopped. This has affected the intensity of the assault on Marib, with all of the Houthi forces concentrated on trying to advance and make a breakthrough into Marib,\u201d said the province\u2019s governor, Sheikh Sultan al-Aradah, in a briefing organised by the Sana\u2019a Center thinktank this week. \u201cThere is no doubt that coalition air power [is making a difference in Marib]. Without their support, the situation would look very different.\u201d The fighting comes as Joe Biden is pushing for the resumption of UN-sponsored talks to end the conflict. The Houthis, however, have also stepped up attacks on Saudi soil. In Iraq, Iran-backed militias have launched a new series of rocket attacks on US installations, putting pressure on a fledgling administration seeking to re-engage Tehran in negotiations over its nuclear programme. In 2018, a UN-brokered ceasefire managed to stop a coalition assault on Yemen\u2019s crucial port city of Hodeidah. But according to Aradah and a UN source with knowledge of the discussions, the Houthis \u2013 who have nothing to lose in the battle for Marib \u2013 are less willing to engage this time. Marib is the Yemeni government\u2019s only northern stronghold: its fall would greatly weaken their negotiating position and derail diplomatic efforts to end the war. \u201cIf the Houthis seize Marib, all manner of conflict will manifest and transform the war into sectarian, ethnic, and regional struggles \u2026 It will take life, and with it the people, to a hell that burns everyone with its fire, directly or not,\u201d said Qadhi.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Century-old olive trees felled as Spain's farmers try to cut costs", "full_article": "Century-old olive trees are being chopped up to use as firewood or sold off as garden ornaments as some in Spain\u2019s olive oil industry turn to younger, more productive trees in hope of lowering costs. In recent years the sector in Spain has been left reeling; a plunge in global olive oil prices was followed by a punishing 25% tariff levied by the US on Spanish olive oil. After prices sank to levels that left many struggling to break even, the industry has slowly recovered, though prices remain shy of 2018 levels. The volatility has left some uprooting the trees that have fuelled olive oil production for generations. \u201cIt\u2019s a pity about these century-old olive trees,\u201d Juan Antonio Galindo, the owner of a 40-hectare farm near Seville recently told the broadcaster RTVE. \u201cBut I have to cut them down to switch to intensive farming \u2026 the difference is huge.\u201d He estimated the move would cut his production costs by more than 70%. While many felled olive trees end up being sold as garden ornaments, he doubted that his trees would find a buyer. Instead, they would likely be used as firewood, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blow to see your trees have to go, but the wallet is also important.\u201d Rafael Pico, who heads the Spanish association of olive oil exporters, said about 70% of Spanish olive oil producers were small-scale operations that often relied on traditional farming methods. \u201cInevitably \u2013 and this is my opinion \u2013 there will be a restructuring of these olive groves towards intensive and super-intensive farming,\u201d he said, pointing to the growth of intensive olive farming in Australia and the US. \u201cIf not they could find themselves left out of the market.\u201d Global competition is likely to intensify, after the EU and the US reached a deal to temporarily suspend the tariffs on Spanish olive oil, along with several other retaliatory tariffs brought in during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. While there were olive farmers switching to intensive production, these cases were far from the norm, said Crist\u00f3bal Cano of the Uni\u00f3n de Peque\u00f1os Agricultores y Ganaderos, which represents about 80,000 small-scale farmers in the country. \u201cIt\u2019s not the majority that are uprooting century-old olive trees to intensively farm.\u201d Some had instead sought to embrace the singularity of Spain\u2019s oldest olive trees. From the Valencian municipality of Traiguera to the southern Spanish town of Casabermeja, farmers are producing olive oils that are vibrantly infused with the history of these trees. These efforts have been boosted by legal protections; lawmakers in Catalonia last year voted to strengthen protections for the region\u2019s oldest olive trees, echoing similar legislation introduced in Valencia in 2006. \u201cChanging from traditional to super-intensive farming isn\u2019t the only way to achieve profitability,\u201d said Cano, arguing that social and environmental factors must also be considered. \u201cThis triple sustainability is what you need to achieve,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that olive growers are increasingly conscious that our future lies in the differentiation of our olive oils and in conveying to consumers the social and environmental impacts that are at play behind each litre of olive oil.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Cryptoart!

The ideas are outlined in health-related sections of a US Studies Centre report provided to Guardian Australia ahead of its formal release next week. Australia has already pledged $500m towards the distribution of vaccines in the region but pooling resources would help Australia boost its engagement in the region, wrote Matilda Steward, an honorary associate at the centre. \u201cEnhanced health cooperation with the United States in south-east Asia and the Pacific would help to ensure a stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific, a key Australian national interest,\u201d she wrote. Steward pointed to estimates that about 35 million infants in south-east Asia have missed routine vaccinations as a result of the pandemic, while pointing to concern about malaria risks in the Pacific. She called on Australia and the US to work together to help deliver routine immunisations that have been disrupted, or to counter infectious diseases at risk of re-emergence. Steward argued Canberra\u2019s aid program is still focused primarily on the Pacific, Timor-Leste and Indonesia, despite Morrison\u2019s recent statements that Australia is focused on the centrality of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Ahead of the first Quad leader-level talks, Morrison said he could not see why China would be concerned about the elevation of the grouping.

Once his $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill is signed, he is set to take an extended victory lap by travelling the country to promote it. \n  Biden will have short and long sales pitches. First, that help is on the way after the hellish year of a pandemic that has killed more than 528,000 people in the US and put many millions out of work. \n  The stimulus, among the biggest in history, includes $400bn to fund $1,400 direct payments to most Americans (unlike Donald Trump, Biden\u2019s signature will not appear on the cheques), $350bn in aid to state and local governments and increased funding for vaccine distribution. \n  Politically, it is an open goal. The risks of inaction were immense; the risks of action are modest.

He plans to speak more about the bill during his speech this evening and will hit the road with the vice president and their spouses to promote the plan next week.  \n   Jen Psaki said Americans could start receiving their stimulus money as early as this weekend.  \n   The Senate voted to advance the nominations of Xavier Becerra and Deb Haaland to lead the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of the Interior respectively. The votes all-but guarantee they will be confirmed next week, despite significant Republican opposition to their nomination.  \n   House speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed to keep pushing to raise the minimum wage after an attempt to include it in the Democrat\u2019s stimulus bill was scrapped.  \n   The House passed a pair of gun-control bills that would expand universal background checks and extend the window for the FBI to run background checks. Both measures face an uphill climb in the Senate.  \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.48pm GMT \n \n \n  10.05pm GMT  \n  \n  In an astonishing piece of attempted backside-covering, former acting defense secretary under the outgoing Donald Trump, Chris Miller, tried to explain in an interview with Vice that the delay in National Guard troops deploying to the US Capitol on the afternoon of 6 January to help overwhelmed police was basically because \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d. \n  Miller said: \u201cIt\u2019s not like a video game\u201d ie going up and down the chains of government and command to deploy troops is a complex process. \n  But in a neat splice, this tweet then has a clip of congressional testimony from William Walker, who commands the District of Columbia National Guard, saying that in dire moments, decisions can be made to call out troops \u201cin minutes\u201d. \n  Grab a listen: \n   \n   \n    Chris Miller translator: \" Hey, I had to take orders from the White House on this.\" https://t.co/ihRrvlvjGc\u2014 TreasonWeaselhunter (@Treasonweaselhu) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 10.20pm GMT \n \n \n  9.56pm GMT  \n  \n  Chris Miller, the former acting defense secretary said he did not speak to Donald Trump on 6 January, the day thousands of the-then president\u2019s supporters left a rally where Trump whipped them into a frenzy and overran the US Capitol, causing members of the House and Senate to run for their lives. \n  Miller told Vice he was alarmed when Trump, in his rally speech, was urging the huge crowd to go down Pennsylvania Avenue (from the White House to the Capitol) and \u201cfight like hell\u201d to \u201cstop the steal\u201d \u2013 as he referred to his incorrect claims that Joe Biden had been wrongly elected president. \n  Vice further reports: \n   \n    Recalling the events of that day, Miller said he wasn\u2019t sure whether Trump was aware that his speech might have such extreme consequences, but he was certain the attack wouldn\u2019t have happened without them.

The relief package was passed without any Republican votes.  \n  The Georgia senators, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff both promised to deliver $2,000 stimulus checks if the state delivered Democrats the majority.  \n  The bill Biden will sign into law shortly will send $1,400 direct payments to most American families, which Democrats say comes in addition to the $600 checks provided for in the last relief bill, enacted by Trump before he left office.  \n  The promotional push around the legislation is part of a recognition by Democrats that they didn\u2019t do enough to sell their economic recovery plan in 2009, when Barack Obama took office in the depths of the economic meltdown. Many Democrats now believe their reticence to claim credit for the massive stimulus package allowed Republicans to cast it as federal overreach and led to their crushing losses during the midterm elections of 2010. \n  Biden will discuss the plan during his first prime-time address on Thursday night. He will travel to Delaware County, Pennsylvania, to promote the bill on Tuesday, while Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff will be dispatched to Nevada, Colorado and New Mexico next week to help educate the public on what\u2019s in the measure.  \n  \n Updated at 8.03pm GMT \n \n \n  6.27pm GMT  \n  \n  Arizona is part of a push by Republican-controlled legislatures across the country impose new voting restrictions after Trump\u2019s unexpected loss in the state. \n  Speaking to CNN about the efforts underway in Phoenix, which would restrict the state\u2019s vote-by-mail system which has been used by voters of both parties for years, Republican lawmaker John Kavanuagh said there was a \u201cfundamental difference between Democrats and Republicans\u201d when it came to the franchise.  \n  \u201cDemocrats value as many people as possible voting, and they\u2019re willing to risk fraud,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don\u2019t mind putting security measures in that won\u2019t let everybody vote \u2013 but everybody shouldn\u2019t be voting.\u201d \n  He continued: \u201cQuantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.\u201d \n  The comment has sparked significant backlash online.  \n  Our voting rights reporter, who has been covering the rise of efforts to curtail voting access across the country following the 2020 election, said his comments amount to a \u201cdog-whistle idea\u201d that is often used to justify curtailing voting access.  \n   \n   \n    This is an appalling, dog-whistle idea that runs in the background of a lot of anti-voting measures.

The final tally was 51-48.  \n  As noted earlier, a Senate panel deadlocked over his nomination, forcing Schumer to bring it to the floor for a full vote on whether to move his confirmation forward.  \n  Some Republicans have argued that Becerra is unqualified to lead the department of Health and Human Services, but their opposition has so far failed to derail his nomination.  \n  Schumer, who used his powers to force the nomination out of a deadlocked committee, defended Becerra during a speech on the Senate floor earlier today. \n   \n   I\u2019m perplexed that none of my Republican colleagues would vote for him. He\u2019s a capable man. He\u2019s worked hard to make sure that people get healthcare. Some have said: well, he\u2019s not a doctor. Neither was the previous Trump nominee for HHS, who happened to be a pharmaceutical company executive.

He said he\u2019ll be leading a delegation to the border on Monday.  \n  Republicans have seized on the issue to attack Biden, blaming his more humanitarian approach to immigration for encouraging migrants from Central America to travel north.  \n  Responding at her earlier press conference, Pelosi said the Republican focus on immigration was only the latest iteration of their strategy to stoke culture wars.  \n  \u201cI guess their Dr Seuss approach did not work for them so now they\u2019ve had to change the topic,\u201d she said. \n  \n Updated at 4.56pm GMT \n \n \n  4.38pm GMT  \n  \n  Pelosi expressed a lot of enthusiasm \u2013 and few details \u2013 about a forthcoming push to pass a sweeping infrastructure bill.  \n  \u201cWe see this as a tremendous opportunity,\u201d she said. \n   \n   \n    Pelosi asked how large an infrastructure bill should be.\u201cI thank you for the question, it\u2019s one of my favorite topics,\u201d Pelosi says.

There are already signs that this may be an all-but impossible task. \n  Some Democrats have tossed out figures like $3tn or even $4tn \u2013 enormous sums that are sure to be a nonstarter for Republicans, who want a narrow, targeted bill focused on roads, bridges and waterways.  \n  But with the Senate filibuster preventing action on much of the Democrats\u2019 agenda, progressives view a public works bill as perhaps the last best chance of notching major victories before next year\u2019s midterm elections. Among the provisions Democrats and activists have suggested should be included in an infrastructure bill: immigration reform, lowering the Medicare eligibility, a public option, and an permanent version of the expanded child tax credit that was passed in Biden\u2019s stimulus bill.  \n  \n Updated at 4.40pm GMT \n \n \n  4.19pm GMT  \n Pelosi on $15 minimum wage push: 'We're not giving up on that' \n  \n  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi opened her weekly press conference by touting the House\u2019s passage of a universal background checks bill and making the case for a $15 federal minimum wage.

Chauvin was already facing second degree murder and second degree manslaughter. \n  He kneeled on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes on 25 May last year on the street in Minneapolis. The killing spurred nationwide and international protests and a massive resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement. \n  Here\u2019s our piece about that ruling: \n   \n    Related: Judge must reconsider third-degree murder charge against officer for George Floyd killing  \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.07pm GMT \n \n \n  2.25pm GMT  \n  \n  This isn\u2019t directly political, at least, not party political, but enough presidents and prominent figures have been thrown into the toxic transatlantic saga of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell over the years (Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, businessmen and academics, to name a few) that the blog takes an interest. \n  In the last 24 hours, news has emerged that the late sex offender Epstein\u2019s infamous Manhattan mansion has been sold for about $51mn and his past girlfriend and alleged accomplice Maxwell has made yet another bid for bail. \n  The mansion was sold to an undisclosed buyer earlier this week, an attorney for the estate said and CNN reported last night. \n  Funds from the sale will be transferred to the Epstein Victims\u2019 Compensation Program so new claims can be issued, Dan Weiner said. \n   \n    CNN previously reported that the independent administrator of the Epstein Victims\u2019 Compensation Program (EVCP), Jordy Feldman, suspended claim payouts from the program on February 4 when she said the estate was too low on cash to support it. Feldman said she will lift the suspension once she evaluates the financial situation. \n   \u201cWe are eager to resume issuing compensation offers as soon as possible,\u201d Feldman said in a statement to CNN. \u201cOnce we have more information about the amount of funds that will be made available to the Program and when, I will decide when we can lift the suspension and get back to full Program operations.\u201d \n   Epstein had pleaded not guilty to federal charges stemming from an indictment accusing him of running a sex-trafficking ring of underage girls, some as young as 14. \n   The 66-year-old multimillionaire financier was found dead in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in August 2019, where he was awaiting trial. New York City\u2019s chief medical examiner said the cause of death was suicide by hanging. \n   \n  In 2019, during a raid on the mansion, where Epstein was accused of sexually abusing minors, authorities found a \u201clocked safe\u201d containing cash, diamonds and an expired passport apparently with Epstein\u2019s picture but a \u201cname that was not his\u201d. The passport, from the early 1980s, was from a \u201cforeign country\u201d and listed Epstein\u2019s country of residence as \u201cSaudi Arabia\u201d, the Guardian reported at the time. \n  Meanwhile, The Associated Press reports from New York: \n   \n    Prosecutors urged a judge to reject a third quest for bail by a British socialite charged with soliciting teenage girls in the 1990s for financier Epstein to sexually abuse. \n   There are multiple reasons to deny Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s effort at freedom before her July trial, prosecutors said in a Tuesday filing in Manhattan federal court. \n   Last month, the 59-year-old Maxwell argued through her lawyers that bail should be granted because she is willing to renounce her citizenship in England and France. Prosecutors called Maxwell an \u201cextreme flight risk\u201d. \n   \n  She\u2019s been held in the same federal detention center in Brooklyn as Epstein since her arrest last summer. \n   \n    \n    \n    Federal prosecutor Audrey Strauss points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell during a news conference in New York last year. \n    Photograph: John Minchillo/AP \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.27pm GMT \n \n \n  1.46pm GMT  \n Derek Chauvin trial: jury selection resumes as officer faces possible new charge \n  \n  Potential jurors in Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder trial return Thursday to continue a selection process moving more quickly than expected. Meanwhile, the former policeman charged in George Floyd\u2019s death faced the prospect of an additional third-degree murder charge. \n  Five jurors have been seated after just two days of screening by attorneys and Peter Cahill, the judge who had set aside at least three weeks to fill the panel. \n  Cahill was expected to start Thursday\u2019s proceeding by discussing next steps in the state\u2019s effort to add a third-degree murder charge. Cahill rejected the charge twice before an appellate ruling in an unrelated case provided new grounds for it right before the trial began. On Wednesday, the state\u2019s supreme court rejected Chauvin\u2019s effort to block the charge. \n  Attorneys have given considerable attention to the jury pool\u2019s attitudes toward police in the first two days of questioning, trying to determine whether they\u2019re more inclined to believe testimony from law enforcement over evidence from other witnesses to the fatal confrontation. \n  Read more here: Derek Chauvin trial \u2013 jury selection resumes as officer faces possible new charge \n   \n    Related: Derek Chauvin trial: jury selection resumes as officer faces possible new charge  \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.43pm GMT  \n 712,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits in the last week \n  \n  Evidence that more action of Covid economic relief was needed comes this morning as it is confirmed that last week 712,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits for the first time. \n  The number is down, and lower than the 750,000 forecast by economists, but still represents a much higher level of weekly job loss than before the pandemic.  \n  Lucy Bayly at NBC News reminds us that: \n   \n   Last month\u2019s jobs report showed that 70 percent of the jobs added in February \u2014 355,000 positions \u2014 were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which has been decimated by the coronavirus as eateries and hotels were forced to close or operate at reduced capacity to contain the spread of the virus. \n   The lifting of mask mandates and other public health measures in states such as Texas, Mississippi and Iowa also means that hiring is likely to see an uptick, especially with warmer weather on the way. \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.33pm GMT  \n  \n  One of the balancing tricks for Joe Biden to maintain support for his Covid recovery measures is convincing the progressive wing of his own party that it is doing enough to tackle structural inequality in the US, while reassuring more centrist Democrats that he has a tight enough rein on the nation\u2019s finances. It also cuts a little against Biden\u2019s history as a politician. However, as the New York Times reports this morning: \n   \n   The new role as a crusader for the poor represents an evolution for Biden, who spent much of his 36 years in Congress concentrating on foreign policy, judicial fights, gun control and criminal justice issues by virtue of his committee chairmanships in the Senate. For the most part, he ceded domestic economic policy to others. \n   But aides say he has embraced his new role. Biden has done so in part by following progressives in his party to the left and accepting the encouragement of his inner circle to use Democratic power to make sweeping rather than incremental change. He has also been moved by the inequities in pain and suffering that the pandemic has inflicted on the poorest Americans, aides say. \n   \u201cWe all grow,\u201d said Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat. \u201cDuring the campaign, he recognized what was happening in this country, this pandemic.

Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar reports for the Associated Press that: \n   \n   The legislation gives states the option of extending Medicaid coverage to women with low to modest incomes for a full year after childbirth. States are currently required to provide only 60 days of coverage, but medical experts point to research showing that women can die from pregnancy-related conditions up to a year after giving birth, and that three in five of all such deaths are preventable. \n   \n   \n   The provisions make it easier for states to cover new mothers for a full year by cutting the time and paperwork needed to obtain approval from Washington under Medicaid, as well as the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Maternal health advisory groups in 19 states, from Texas to Massachusetts, and Washington to Tennessee, have recommended such an extension. \n   Last year a bipartisan bill to do so cleared the House but failed to advance in the Senate. \n   \n  The issue is particularly serious for Black women, whose pregnancy-related death rate is three to four times that of white women, according to the CDC. \n  A recent report from the Commonwealth Fund found the US to have the highest maternal mortality rate among 11 developed nations. \n  During his 2020 presidential campaign, Joe Biden pledged to \u201creduce our unacceptably high maternal mortality rate, which especially impacts people of color.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  1.10pm GMT  \n  \n  Again Joe Biden\u2019s White House team have been very vocal on social media this morning about new poll numbers suggesting that, away from Congress at least, there is bipartisan support for the $1.9 trillion Covid rescue package that Joe Biden will sign into law later this week. \n  According to the network\u2019s figures, three in four Americans approve of Congress passing the American Rescue Plan, including nearly half of Republican voters. \n   \n   \n    NEW FROM @CBSNewsPoll: Three in four Americans approve of Congress passing the American Rescue Plan.

A veto-proof majority of city council members previously promised to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by a state oversight commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. \n  By this winter, the summer\u2019s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m \u2013 out of a total budget of $179m \u2013 and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council\u2019s more genuinely radical rhetoric. \n  [Now]\u2026the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order authorizing national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of \u201cextraordinary public safety events\u201d. The state is also coordinating with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \n  The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being turned into a fortress. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people.  \n  Read more here: Akin Olla \u2013 Minneapolis promised change after George Floyd.

Speaking on MSNBC\u2019s Today programming, the leading expert on infectious diseases said: \n   \n   The virus is still very much circulating in the community and then you get the possibility of another surge. That\u2019s one of the things we\u2019re concerned about. [Case numbers are] plateauing but I hope it starts to start going down at a less steep decline, but continues to go down. \n   I believe every day as we get two million or more people vaccinated, and if people continue to abide by the public health measures, we should be okay. As you know we have variants circulating in this country that are a bit different than the original virus. We don\u2019t want them to take off on us, and give us another surge\u201d. \n   \n  Speaking to Savannah Guthrie, he urged the nation to \u201ckeep putting our foot to the pedal when it comes to public health measures.\u201d \n  Questioned over states like Texas dropping mask mandates and New York planning to re-open outdoor dining, Fauci said: \n   \n   It is risky. I understand why they want to do it, no doubt about it. I don\u2019t want to be critical of it in the sense of saying that they\u2019re doing something bad, but I think they really better be careful. \n   You remember when we tried to open up the country, open up the economy, we gave the different guidelines.

It will be a great embarrassment to the USA.\u201d \n  But during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, it was clear voters would choose an alternative to in-person voting, and the number of voters by mail soared. \n  The November election was ultimately described by officials at all levels as the most secure in US history. \n  Read more of Jada Butler\u2019s report here: Trump once again requests mail-in ballot despite repeatedly attacking method \n   \n    Related: Trump once again requests mail-in ballot despite repeatedly attacking method  \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.10pm GMT  \n  \n  Yesterday Secretary of state Antony Blinken and Defense secretary Lloyd J Austin III announced that their first ventures overseas for the Biden administration would be a joint trip to South Korea and Japan. \n  This morning, Robert Burns reports for Associated Press on how the new president is trying to shore up alliances tested by the unpredictible foreign policy initiatives of his predecessor Donald Trump. \n  A new agreement with South Korea on sharing the cost of keeping US troops on the peninsula is early evidence Biden will cut allies a break to build unity in competition against China and Russia. \n  Trump had demanded South Korea pay billions more to keep American troops on its soil. In his view, the United States was getting fleeced by what he suggested were freeloaders masquerading as allies. Initially, Trump insisted the South Korean government pay five times as much as it previously had. Seoul balked, diplomacy went nowhere, and relations with a treaty ally began to fray. \n  Biden, by contrast, has settled for a 13.9% boost and follow-on increases that put the issue to rest. Biden\u2019s view is that well-functioning alliances are central to competing with China, which his administration sees as America\u2019s biggest long-term security challenge, along with Russia. \n  In what the White House called a sign of Biden\u2019s commitment to partnering in the Asia-Pacific region, on Friday he will meet virtually with the leaders of three other regional powerhouses \u2014 India, Australia and Japan. \n  Japan and South Korea for decades have been linchpins of the US defense strategy in the broader Asia-Pacific region, which the top US commander there, Admiral Philip Davidson, has called \u201cthe most consequential region for America\u2019s future.\u201d Last month, the US and Japan agreed to a one-year extension of their cost-sharing agreement for the US troop presence; the State Department said this allowed more time to negotiate a longer deal. \n  \n \n \n  11.46am GMT  \n Joe Biden will address the nation on 'next phase' of fight against Covid this evening \n  \n  The Miami Covid exhibition may be looking back at a year of coronavirus in the US, but tonight President Joe Biden will be trying to direct the nation forward to a more hopeful future with a national address at 8pm EST (0100 GMT Friday) \n  Zeke Miller writes for Associated Press that Biden will use this first prime-time address since taking office to steer the nation toward the \u201cnext phase\u201d of the fight against the pandemic. Previewing his remarks, Biden said he would \u201ctalk about what we\u2019ve been through as a nation this past year, but more importantly, I\u2019m going to talk about what comes next.\u201d \n  Biden\u2019s challenge tonight will be to honor the sacrifices made by Americans over the last year while encouraging them to remain vigilant despite \u201cvirus fatigue\u201d and growing impatience to resume normal activities given the tantalizing promise of vaccines. Speaking on the one-year anniversary of the World Health Organization\u2019s declaration of a pandemic, he\u2019ll mourn the dead, but also project optimism about the future. \n  \u201cThis is a chance for him to really beam into everybody\u2019s living rooms and to be both the mourner in chief and to explain how he\u2019s leading the country out of this,\u201d said presidential historian and Rice University professor Douglas Brinkley. \n  \u201cThis is a big moment,\u201d Brinkley added. \u201cHe\u2019s got to win over hearts and minds for people to stay masked and get vaccinated, but also recognize that after the last year, the federal government hasn\u2019t forgotten you.\u201d \n  Biden said he would focus his remarks on what his administration plans to deliver in the coming months, but also reiterate his call for Americans to continue to practice social distancing and wear face coverings to hasten the end of the pandemic. \n  \u201cI\u2019m going to launch the next phase of the Covid response and explain what we will do as a government and what we will ask of the American people,\u201d he said. \n  Almost exactly one year ago, then-President President Donald Trump addressed the nation to mark the WHO\u2019s declaration of a global pandemic.

Artifacts and memories of the deadliest global pandemic in a century are on display at what is probably the nation\u2019s first comprehensive coronavirus museum exhibition, forming an enduring testament to an unprecedented era. \n  Highlights of the collection at the downtown HistoryMiami museum include personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by doctors who treated Covid-19 patients at a local hospital; an emergency beach closure order sign from Miami Beach; a sign from a closed, open, then closed again restaurant; a high school student\u2019s mortarboard from her drive-through graduation ceremony; and a younger student\u2019s school workbook from online learning. \n  There are colorful handmade posters from drive-by birthday celebrations and first responder appreciation parades; vials of two of the first Pfizer vaccines administered at Jackson Memorial hospital; and a jar of hand sanitizer produced by Toast, a vodka company that switched operations at its Miami distillery early in the pandemic. \n  Arguably the star exhibit is the gown and scythe belonging to the Grim Reaper, an outfit worn by a Florida attorney on several of the state\u2019s crowded beaches last spring as he protested against the refusal of Governor Ron DeSantis to close them down. \n  Daniel Uhlfelder, who is from Miami and majored in history before going on to practice law in Florida\u2019s Panhandle, said the preservation of his costume was a powerful reminder of the politicization of the pandemic. \n  \u201cI hope people look at it and see what our elected officials and other people were doing wrong, and ignoring and lying and politicizing and scapegoating,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope they see that there were people that decided to do something peacefully and creatively and honestly and courageously, and took things into their own hands.

The US needs to set a target to slash its greenhouse gas emissions between 57% and 63% below 2005 levels by 2030 in order to achieve the Biden administration\u2019s longer-term goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the new analysis which came out today. \n  Climate Action Tracker (CAT) analyzed President Joe Biden\u2019s plans to decarbonize the electricity sector, commercial buildings and new vehicle fleet and found that in order for the United States to do its share to limit the rise of global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius - the goal of the Paris Agreement - it needs to cut at least 57% of its emissions by the end of the decade. \n  Biden\u2019s climate team, led by National Climate Adviser Gina McCarthy and Climate Envoy John Kerry, is working with all government agencies and holding meetings with utilities and car companies as it crafts its new goal. \n  The CAT report says that the Biden administration plan to decarbonize the US power sector by 2035 is consistent with a Paris Agreement pathway but it needs to strengthen plans to slash emissions in buildings and vehicles. \n  \n \n \n  11.09am GMT  \n  \n  Michael Regan, who has served as North Carolina\u2019s top environmental regulator since 2017, was confirmed to lead the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday.

It also included a provision to make the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits received in 2020 tax-free for households earning less than $150,000. \n  Child tax credit: The legislation significantly increases \u2013 and expands eligibility for \u2013 the child tax credit. Under the bill, the tax credit would jump from $2,000 a child under 17 to $3,600 for children up to age five and $3,000 for children aged between six and 17. \n  Health insurance subsidies: The bill would temporarily increase financial assistance for health coverage purchased through marketplaces established by the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. \n  Vaccine distribution and testing: The bill provides tens of billions of dollars to speed up vaccine distribution and administration. \n  Pandemic response: The bill sends $350bn to state, local and tribal governments, to help offset deep budget shortfalls as a result of efforts to combat the pandemic. \n  Rental, mortgage and food assistance: The legislation also includes a number of other provisions that would provide assistance for food and housing, including money for low-income Americans to afford rent and pay their utilities, and aid to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages because of the pandemic. \n  Read the details in full here: $1,400 stimulus checks and vaccine funds \u2013 what the Covid relief bill contains \n   \n    Related: $1,400 stimulus checks and vaccine funds: what the Covid relief bill contains  \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.39am GMT  \n  \n  \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d has been the punchline to conservative jokes since the Reagan era.

Troops promptly removed the pages, only for resourceful demonstrators to return with stencils to paint the junta leader\u2019s image on to the concrete. \nThe protest tactic offered some protection against charging soldiers, who were apparently forbidden from treading on an image of their commander-in-chief. It was also a chance for the public to express their deep disdain for the man who stole their democracy. \nThe decision by Min Aung Hlaing to seize power on 1 February brought an abrupt end to Myanmar\u2019s transition, after decades of military rule, to a more democratic system, and prompted fury across the country. It also presented the military with one of the biggest challenges in its 80-year history, as protesters poured on to the streets of cities, towns and villages while vast numbers went on strike, bringing trade, banks and transport systems to a standstill. \n\u201cIt was a massive strategic miscalculation on their part,\u201d said Richard Horsey, an independent political analyst, who added that the military appeared to have severely underestimated the level of public opposition. \u201cBut I think they still believe they can win this.\u201d \nFaced with opposition across society, the military has been unleashing a campaign of terror and chaos. Protesters are being detained, brutally beaten and, increasingly, shot dead. After dark, trucks of troops swarm through residential areas, firing indiscriminately and setting off stun grenades. Every night homes are raided, with officers going door to door arresting protesters and anyone deemed to be sheltering them. About 1,800 people have been taken, although this is probably an underestimate. \n\u201cThe level of violence and intimidation that they\u2019re having to mete out is creating a wellspring of hatred and opposition that is unifying much of the country,\u201d added Horsey. \u201cThey will be able to deploy the violence that\u2019s necessary to impose their will, but then what?\u201d \nThe military will be left presiding over a country with deep, multiple crises, he added, with far less domestic or international support. \n \n  \n  \n  Protesters barricade a Yangon road with women\u2019s longyi. \n  Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPA \n  \n \nMin Aung Hlaing appeared to have thought protests would be more easily suppressed, and that he could win support from people frustrated with the leadership of Aung San Suu Kyi, who came to power in the 2015 elections, the first free vote in decades. Both assumptions have so far proved wrong. \n\u201cI think the state administration council [the junta] probably calculated that there would be demonstrations, but they probably underestimated how sustained and creative these would be,\u201d said Moe Thuzar, a co-coordinator of the Myanmar studies programme at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. They also underestimated the potential impact of the protesters\u2019 civil disobedience movement, she added, in which huge numbers of people have walked out of their jobs, paralysing the country. Faced with such widespread opposition, the junta is resorting to the authoritarian playbook of the past. \nThe military\u2019s brutal use of violence means far fewer people are now protesting. Many are still refusing to go to work, however, increasingly because they are too afraid to do so when the military is out on the streets. \nMin Aung Hlaing took over as commander-in-chief in 2011 as Myanmar began the transition to democracy, under a constitution that granted the military significant powers. He was due to retire soon and it was widely known he aspired to be president, a position Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) refused to grant him. \nIn an interview with Russia Today last June, a presenter praised his leadership qualities before adding that she hoped he would \u201cbe able to perform duties with higher authorities in the interest of the country, the world and world peace\u201d. He replied: \u201cI always have such desires.\u201d \nWhen the military\u2019s proxy party was humiliatingly trounced in November\u2019s elections, and it became clear Min Aung Hlaing\u2019s ambitions would not be realised at the ballot box, the military accused the NLD, without evidence, of election fraud \u2013 claims it used to justify the coup. \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nMin Aung Hlaing\u2019s relationship with Aung San Suu Kyi was strained, and there was reportedly almost no face-to-face communication, with both apparently fearing what their counterpart was plotting. Analysts believe there was anger over what the generals considered Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s arrogant refusal to consider their concerns regarding last year\u2019s election, which only added to the military\u2019s fear that they had become sidelined since agreeing to share power. \nIn fact, the military had retained huge powers, including autonomy over defence, and received a greater share of the national budget than health and education combined, as well as retaining its lucrative business networks. \nSince the coup, some western governments have tried to target the army\u2019s financial interests to pressure the regime to act with restraint \u2013 although the strike movement is inflicting far greater damage than potential sanctions could hope to do. \nThuzar said the number of people participating varied across ministries, but in the ministry for natural resources and environment, 56% were refusing to work, according to one estimate.  \n\u201cEven if only half the people in customs at a border trade post, the people who are supposed to process goods coming in, are participating, that slows things down. It affects the supply chain,\u201d she said. One of the most brutal crackdown on protesters was against shipyard workers who had refused to work, apparently bringing trade to a standstill. \n\u201cThe current situation is testing the unity of the military in a way it has probably never been tested before,\u201d Horsey said. \nThere is no indication that the generals may turn against Min Aung Hlaing, although splits are not impossible. Most analysts agree that the military is so opaque that there is no way of knowing if there is disunity. \u201cThe only thing that is predictable is that the military does have the power to increase the violence and try to stamp this out,\u201d said David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst. \u201cBut at what cost?\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Scott Morrison says AstraZeneca vaccine is safe for Australians after reports of blood clots", "full_article": "Scott Morrison has sought to reassure Australians that the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine is safe after some European countries suspended their rollouts of the jab during an investigation into cases of blood clots. The prime minister said he had discussed the reports with health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, who did not believe there was a need to change Australia\u2019s classification of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Morrison also said Australia\u2019s Therapeutic Goods Administration considered data from overseas rollouts as well as conducting its own testing of the vaccine batches being distributed across Australia.   Related: Australia news live: News Corp photographer condemns 'toxic' sexism at tabloids; AstraZeneca rollout won't be halted after EU concerns    Overnight, Denmark, Norway and Iceland announced they were temporarily halting all AstraZeneca vaccinations to investigate the cases, after the European Medicines Agency said 30 cases of \u201cthromboembolic events\u201d or blood clots had been reported among 5 million people who had received the jab in Europe so far. Italy followed Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Luxembourg and Lithuania in banning inoculations with one particular batch of 1m doses that was sent to 17 countries. Denmark\u2019s national health agency said it was suspending AstraZeneca vaccinations for two weeks because a 60-year-old woman who was given a shot from the same batch had formed a blood clot and subsequently died. Morrison, who is acting health minister while Greg Hunt recovers from cellulitis, also attempted to quash criticism of his government\u2019s slower than anticipated vaccine rollout after a concession from Murphy on Thursday that some Australians may only have had one dose by the October target that the government set for full vaccination. \u201cThis is not news,\u201d Morrison said in Sydney on Friday morning, insisting that receiving just the first of two jabs could be considered vaccinating a population as it achieved the immediate protective benefits. But he acknowledged that he expected just 150,000 vaccine doses to be administered by the end of this week, and that the government had not been able to secure as much vaccine supply as it had hoped to by now. When asked if he was worried by concerns in Europe that the AstraZeneca vaccine had caused blood clots among a handful of millions of recipients, Morrison said: \u201cI trust our Therapeutic Goods Administration and the advice that they give me. \u201cAll the data from all of the places that we have relationships with, which obviously includes Europe, is being fed into the TGA, and that data is examined and that\u2019s what informs the decisions that we take here in Australia.

The review, commissioned by the city council following nationwide demonstrations last year, was released on Thursday as the trial opens in Minneapolis for Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with killing Floyd on 25 May 2020. \u201cOn May 27 and 28, the protests in downtown Los Angeles were marred by an escalating level of violence and criminality. Initially, the (Los Angeles police) department treated these as isolated incidents, rather than as a manifestation of a larger expression of outrage that was spreading across the United States,\u201d the report said. The LAPD did not immediately respond to the report. The review, headed by the criminal defense attorney Gerald Chaleff, found that LAPD commanders failed to establish a clear command structure for directing its response to the outbreak of violence, leading to a \u201cchaos of command\u201d that left officers unsure of who was in charge as events unfolded. \u201cIt appears the department believed that if protests arising out of George Floyd\u2019s death occurred in Los Angeles that they all would be peaceful,\u201d the report\u2019s authors said. \u201cIn interviews with the review team, interviewees said they were surprised at the violence that occurred in the afternoon and evening hours at some protests.\u201d Other mistakes cited in the analysis included poor training of officers in use of non-lethal weapons, and failing to anticipate that the protests could spread beyond the city\u2019s downtown and lack of field jails. \u201cThousands of people were arrested throughout the protests without a clearly articulated plan for detentions, transportation and processing,\u201d the report said. \u201cThose arrested were detained at the scene of the arrests for hours, handcuffed on the pavement, detained in buses, and taken to remote locations, without water or the use of bathroom facilities.\u201d The report also noted that the protests occurred during the pandemic, meaning that \u201cofficers and those arrested were in close proximity, not socially distancing, many without masks and thus at risk of being exposed to the Covid-19 virus.\u201d Between 29 May and 2 June, the LAPD arrested more than 4,000 people, the report stated.   Related:  LA's top prosecutor adopted major reforms. Law enforcement is fighting to block every policy    A number of lawsuits have been filed against the city of Los Angeles and the LAPD in connection with these arrests and injuries incurred during these protests. \u201cThere are reports that people were struck in the face and head, causing significant injuries, some of which required surgery,\u201d the report stated. \u201cNot all people struck with less lethal munitions during the protests were engaging in criminal behavior. This appears to be in part due to the complex and rapid movement of the crowds and at times a lack of adequate training.\u201d In all, the 101-page report had 67 findings and listed 10 recommendations that included a periodic audit that the LAPD is in compliance with all lawsuit settlements, an extensive study of less-lethal munitions, an update on use-of-force directives in large crowds and more instruction regarding the use of less-lethal munitions on crowds. The report noted that during the protests, 106 officers suffered injuries from \u201cdangerous objects being thrown at them, lasers used to injure their eyes, and other methods used to injure the officers and incite the crowd of protesters\u201d. In addition, 141 LAPD patrol cars were severely damaged and six were destroyed by fire and other forms of vandalism. Yet \u201cdespite the provocations, the police must be able to effectively address those who are committing criminal acts and causing disruption,\u201d the report states. \u201cOne of the fundamental duties of policing is to protect the first amendment right to free speech, assembly and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances,\u201d the report reads. \u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "World at 'peak twin' as birth rates reach historic high, study finds", "full_article": "Twins may be more common today than at any time in history, according to the first comprehensive survey of twin births around the world. Researchers analysed records from more than 100 countries and found a substantial rise in twin birthrates since the 1980s, with one in 42 people now born a twin, equivalent to 1.6 million children a year. According to the study, the global twin birthrate has risen by one-third, on average, over the past 40 years. Rather than seeing the trend continue, the world may have reached \u201cpeak twin\u201d, the authors say, as the most recent data suggest some countries have begun to see twinning rates plateau or even fall from historic highs. \u201cThe trends are really quite striking,\u201d said Christiaan Monden, a professor of sociology and demography at Oxford University. \u201cOver the past 40 to 50 years we\u2019ve seen a strong increase in twinning rates in rich, developed countries, and that has led to more twins in both a relative and an absolute sense than we\u2019ve seen ever before.\u201d Twins are born naturally when a fertilised egg spontaneously splits in half, leading to identical twins, or when the mother releases two eggs at once that are both fertilised, producing non-identical twins. Most now are born as a result of fertility treatments, such as ovarian stimulation or having more than one in vitro fertilisation (IVF) embryo transferred into the womb at the same time, a practice now discouraged in many countries on health grounds. While the birthrate for identical twins has barely changed over time, Monden and his colleagues found that naturally conceived, non-identical twins and twins born as a result of medically assisted reproduction \u2013 an umbrella term for a range of fertility treatments \u2013 had risen globally.     Five-year-old twins Syanda, left, and Andile Bhengu pose for a photograph during a celebration for the 21 pairs of twins at their primary school in Durban, South Africa. Photograph: Kim Ludbrook/EPA    The main drivers are increased access to hormone treatment, IVF and other fertility services but also the postponement of parenthood \u2013 the chances of having natural, non-identical twins increases with age and peaks at 35 to 39 years old. The researchers analysed twinning rates from 2010-15 in 165 countries covering 99% of the world\u2019s population. For 112 of those, they examined further birth records for 1980-85, according a report in Human Reproduction. Globally, twinning rates have risen from nine to 12 per 1,000 births since the 1980s, but the picture varies substantially from country to country. The greatest rises are seen in North America (71%), Europe (60%) and Asia (32%). In the UK, twinning rates rose about 62% but are thought to have fallen since the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) launched a campaign to reduce multiple births in 2007. In the Oxford study, a decrease of more than 10% was found in only seven countries over the dates surveyed. Africa has a high rate of twins born naturally from two separate eggs, and according to the study 80% of twins are now born either in Africa or Asia. \u201cThe absolute number of twin deliveries has increased everywhere except South America,\u201d Monden said. \u201cIn North America and Africa, the numbers have increased by more than 80%, and in Africa this increase is caused almost entirely by population growth.\u201d     Raj Mathur, chair of the British Fertility Society: \u2018I think we\u2019ve reached a peak, in terms of twinning rates from medical interventions, certainly in the developed world.\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian     Related: Have you seen the price of sperm? It's time to democratise fertility treatment | Arwa Mahdawi    Raj Mathur, the chair of the British Fertility Society and a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Manchester, said: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise us that twinning rates have increased because the availability of assisted reproduction has increased and also because women are slightly older when they have their first children, and both those things will increase the twin rate. \u201cBut at same time it\u2019s very likely that if you look at western Europe, particularly the UK and Scandinavian countries, you might find that the rates are lower than they were in 2010 and 2015. The HFEA and the UK sector have achieved a year-on-year reduction in multiple birth rates, which were once at 20% and are now around 10%. \u201cI think we\u2019ve reached a peak in terms of twinning rates from medical interventions, certainly in the developed world, but the spread of IVF in Africa and South America is still rather limited on a per capita basis, and there are vast numbers of sub-fertile people in Africa particularly who don\u2019t have access to IVF. The challenge will be how to spread IVF to them without also giving them higher twin rates. \u201cThe majority of twin babies are absolutely fine, but there is no doubt that a twin pregnancy carries greater risks for the mother and the baby, so when we can avoid it we should avoid it.

On the Thursday we knew a member of the team had suspected symptoms and was being tested. I don\u2019t know why, but even though we were going about our activities as normal, I did have a hunch that the race would be cancelled with things around the world getting worse, and that we wouldn\u2019t be coming back to the track the next day. Going back to the hotel that night, I got a call from Andrea [Stella, the racing director], who gave me the news that McLaren were pulling out of the weekend because our team member had tested positive.

Mark Gonnella, director of communications, Arsenal: We knew the implications would be far-reaching. I was aware he [Arteta] had gone home poorly and that we were awaiting the outcome of the test result. Our match at Manchester City the previous day had already been postponed and it felt as if we were at the epicentre of everything.

And from that first round of testing we had five players return positive tests pretty soon after. It was just like a car going down a hill that you just couldn\u2019t apply the brakes. It kicked up a momentum of its own, the picture was changing by the hour, and it was the beginning of the end in society as we knew it at the time. There was a Nottingham Forest game [against Millwall] that the Greek owner [Evangelos Marinakis] had attended in the Championship and his other club, Olympiakos, had had a few cases and then it suddenly became very real. We were due to play Accrington on the Saturday and their owner, Andy Holt, had expressed concern at how quickly the virus was spreading. We spoke to the EFL [English Football League] and said we were really nervous about the game taking place while we were waiting for results of our players being tested and over those few days it spiralled to the point where by that Saturday the whole of the EFL was suspended. It was just one of those surreal things you think is never going to happen.      The front of Guardian Sport\u2019s print edition on 14 March 2020. Photograph: The  Guardian    Rick Parry, EFL chairman: The first thing that Friday [13 March] was an early morning call with the Premier League and FA where we agreed that we would take a common line. Then we called a board meeting, at extremely short notice, to focus on the single issue: do we play this weekend or not? The Premier League obviously had their concerns about Arteta. We had concerns about Nottingham Forest and Portsmouth in particular, and I think there was another club where positives were starting to appear. It was definitely a live issue. So although at that point the government guidance was that it was still safe, we decided it wasn\u2019t. The decision to postpone was pretty quickly and unanimously reached. Gareth Davies, then chairman of the Welsh Rugby Union: We were at Twickenham the previous Saturday [for England v Wales]. The prime minister was there and everything was fine. At that stage people didn\u2019t know the effect Covid-19 was going to have on us all. The first time it really registered was on the Monday. My daughter is a paediatric consultant and she said to me: \u201cDad, are you comfortable with the Scotland game going ahead on Saturday?\u201d But the official advice we were receiving was that outdoor events were permitted, that even if there were mass gatherings outside you wouldn\u2019t get infected. As a rugby board, who were we to go against that? By the Thursday, even so, I was getting twitchy. But other sporting events were still proceeding so I informed the government we were going ahead with the game. Then, on the Friday morning, I got up early to discover the Premier League had changed their minds. Apart from Cheltenham we were suddenly the last man standing. So I called another board meeting for midday, rang the first minister, Mark Drakeford, and said my recommendation would be that we pulled the game. He understood our position totally and was very understanding. Thank God we did call it off. Cheltenham have been crucified for carrying on, haven\u2019t they?

You were confused, didn\u2019t know how serious it was and what it meant for any of us. How much time was this really going to take out? The rest of that weekend is pretty blurred. Joe Denly, England and Kent batsman: England were playing a four-day warm-up match in Sri Lanka and I remember fielding on the boundary, thinking to myself: \u201cWhat am I doing here?

I remember thinking: \u201cWoah, this is major.\u201d It snowballed quickly after that. Within days it was clear that the London Marathon was increasingly unlikely to be held on its traditional April date because of Covid-19, and so behind the scenes we rushed to get approval from the mayor, Transport for London and the boroughs to move the race to October. Thankfully they were all incredibly understanding. On 13 March we broke the news to the world.

I had a conversation shortly afterwards with Dr Iain McNeil, the Racecourse Association\u2019s medical adviser, and we almost said simultaneously: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to advise to suspend racing.\u201d Then there were very difficult conversations with stakeholders to get them to understand the importance of this, and what was coming over the horizon.

Photograph: Christian Hartmann/Reuters    Coco Gauff, tennis player: Actually, I liked it at first just to have time home. And then I remember the last month or so I was anxious to play \u2013 practising and staying motivated was just a little bit tough because you set goals for yourself and that\u2019s how you stay motivated. But there were no goals to look forward to so it was hard to stay motivated. Dominic Thiem, tennis player:  In the beginning, well, I thought that the tour is going to be back in two or three weeks and everything is going to be normal again. But slowly, of course, me and also everybody else realised that it\u2019s a serious, dangerous thing going on and that there is going to be a longer break.

I think my experience of the pandemic would have been very different if I\u2019d stayed in my sweaty hot apartment in France for the entirety of lockdown. I was injured at the time and wondering which team I was going to be at next season [Bronze moved to Manchester City in September], so there were a lot of things going through my head. My focus was all over the place at that point to be honest. I felt the stress of the situation really highly.  Christian Horner: I am proud of how we responded. Very quickly the team and F1 applied itself to the challenge of building ventilators to battle Covid. We had a group of engineers that turned around in three weeks what would usually take three years to get an up-and-running prototype ventilator in collaboration with other UK-based F1 teams.      The breathing aid developed in less than a week by mechanical engineers, doctors and the Mercedes F1 team.

It was weird, it was the longest period of time that I\u2019d not been in a race car or doing any kind of driving on track since I was seven years old. Mentally I felt OK, as I don\u2019t mind spending time on my own and could still do things I liked. It was more the periods of time when you were able to go outside and see your mates as things opened up a little that were more challenging for me, since I couldn\u2019t risk anything so didn\u2019t go out to see anyone. I felt like I was missing out on feeling \u201cnormal\u201d, which was tough. I couldn\u2019t see my parents or friends in person for quite a while, but it never got to a really bad point. Ian Poulter: I had the opportunity to have pure family time. That sounds extremely selfish but I enjoyed that break. I\u2019ve been a pro for 22 years and never had that time at home simply because of my job. In some respects, it was the most wonderful five months I\u2019ll ever have with my family. Horse racing returned in the UK on 1 June. F1 hosted its first race in Austria on 5 July. Jerry Hill: The thing that\u2019s really got us through this is working together as a sport. I think if we\u2019re going to take something positive out of this very, very difficult year, it\u2019s that. Christian Horner: Once we were racing everyone dealt with the new reality incredibly well. You had to roll with the punches and take on the challenge. There was the constant testing, the occasional positive case, team members were away from home, they were locked in hotel rooms in the evenings, it was tough conditions, we did three triple headers in a row. It was a brutal schedule, but there were no complaints, everybody just got on with it for the good of the sport. The fact that we did manage to fit in 17 races effectively between lockdowns was a great achievement by the whole sport.     Sign up for the Recap.   Golf restarted in June, cricket in July, rugby and tennis in August. Joe Denly: When cricket eventually resumed in the bubble I found it tough at first. I missed the buzz from the crowds and not being a golfer, or into computer games, it wasn\u2019t easy to switch off on days off. Not being allowed to shower in the dressing room after a long day in the field wasn\u2019t great, either. With England we were staying on site, at least, but back at Kent it was a case of jumping in the car for a disgusting drive home!

A year of understanding so many new things; face masks, having sand sanitiser in your car, different states with different rules. Then when it means from a global golfer\u2019s perspective. I feel like I\u2019m still in a bit of a whirlwind because I\u2019ve played so few events. Gareth Davies: For rugby the next few years are going to be tough. It\u2019s going to be an ongoing challenge for every union worldwide. The only slightly disappointing thing for me is that it\u2019s presented an opportunity to get a lot of other things together, such as a global season, and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve taken full advantage of that. Hugh Brasher: I\u2019m proud of what we did next.

Lucy Bronze: There\u2019s that old saying, we say it a lot in football, we always say it at England camps, that you can only control the controllables. A game might get cancelled, or my house might have been delayed or something else, but I can just control what I can control. I can imagine there are people in the world that are a lot worse off, too, and so I\u2019ve just tried to stay as positive as possible about the situation that I\u2019m in. I\u2019m very fortunate to be a professional football player and to still go to work, even in these times, to do the thing that I love. Not many people can say that at the minute.

We have played 41 competitive games since mid-September and it puts an additional strain on people. Winning the FA Cup was a real boost for everyone, even if we all felt the absence of fans at Wembley and the traditional parade through Islington. It was also a special moment to welcome 2,000 of our home supporters back for two games in December. If it needed reinforcing, those nights emphasised that the fans are fundamental to everything we do.

Despite discussions with government and authorities about neutral grounds we always thought the best approach was to play on home territory. Who would know better how to keep the ground secure and sterile than the club that owned it? Others were taking different views but we stuck to our principles on that. When you live through the ultimate challenges it\u2019s day by day. The credit has to go to the clubs. They\u2019re the ones that made it happen, they\u2019re the ones who rallied round.

The London landmark once known as the Millennium Dome will begin by installing 10 of the 68cm (27in) vertical turbines. The breezy conditions at the site on the River Thames will help generate enough clean electricity to power 23 homes.   graphic showing how mini-turbine works   Although this is a small amount of the O2\u2019s total energy consumption, the arena\u2019s owner, AEG, expects to install more of the mini turbines across its stadiums worldwide. The new breed of turbine is said to be able to spin from even a gentle movement of air, or a passing car. Each unit is made from recycled plastic and weighs about 4kg (9lbs), but the design could be scaled up to help generate as much electricity as 20 sq metres of solar panels, according to its developer, Alpha 311. Lee Lacey, the facility director at the O2, said the arena had \u201cbeen searching for a suitable wind-generated power source\u201d to help cut its greenhouse gas emissions and reach its ambition to become a net zero carbon entertainment venue.  \u201cThe opportunity to provide a local on-site source of power generation is huge and we hope this trial provides the launchpad of many more installations, not only at the O2 and other AEG venues but across the Greenwich peninsula and throughout the UK,\u201d she said. Alpha 311 turbines were originally designed to be larger, at just nearly 2 metes in length, and installed on infrastructure with a connection to the electricity grid, such as streetlights, to help to reduce costs. Installing the turbines on streetlights along motorways, for example, could generate eight times as much clean electricity as they are expected to produce at the O2 Arena. Motorways also offer the advantage of minimal installation time and no negative impact on the environment or local views, which can be a concern for traditional windfarms in some areas. Barry Thompson, the chief executive of Alpha 311, said the company was already in talks with international buyers. He said: \u201cThe Alpha 311 turbine was born in Britain with international aspirations, so it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re working with the world\u2019s most popular music, entertainment and leisure venue.\u201d", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-12", "title": "Tim Berners-Lee says too many young people are excluded from web", "full_article": "Too many young people around the world are excluded from accessing the web, and getting them online should be a priority for the post-Covid era, Tim Berners-Lee has said. In a letter published to mark the 32nd birthday of the web, its founder says the opportunity \u201cto reimagine our world and create something better\u201d in the aftermath of Covid-19 must be channelled to getting internet access to the third of people aged between 15 and 24 who are offline. \u201cThe influence of young people is felt across their communities and online networks,\u201d Berners-Lee writes. \u201cBut today we\u2019re seeing just a fraction of what\u2019s possible. Because while we talk about a generation of \u2018digital natives\u2019, far too many young people remain excluded and unable to use the web to share their talents and ideas. \u201cA third of young people have no internet access at all. Many more lack the data, devices and reliable connection they need to make the most of the web. In fact, only the top third of under-25s have a home internet connection, according to Unicef, leaving 2.2 billion young people without the stable access they need to learn online, which has helped so many others continue their education during the pandemic.\u201d Even though young people are more likely than the typical global citizen to have internet access \u2013 roughly half the world is online, but the figure rises to 70% of people aged between 15 and 25 \u2013 Berners-Lee argues that aiming to connect every young person in the world to the web would reap dividends.  He also says doing so would be relatively cheap compared with the cost of many government programmes launched over the last 12 months. He estimates that an investment of $428bn (\u00a3307bn) over the next decade would provide everyone with a quality broadband connection. Rosemary Leith, who co-founded the Web Foundation with Berners-Lee, said access to the web should be a basic right for young people, similar to education. \u201cIf half a generation of young people are unable to use the tools to thrive in a digital world \u2013 to learn new skills, run businesses, build communities, participate in democratic debate \u2013 society as a whole will miss out on their talents, ideas and efforts,\u201d she said.

Carrie was the worst one \u2013 she looked at her phone all the time. It took her over, what was being said. And there could be 30 nice things said, one bad thing said, and that was it.\u201d She said of social media platforms: \u201cThey failed to protect anybody. I think we know it\u2019s Caroline because she\u2019s my daughter and Jo\u2019s sister, but they don\u2019t protect anyone. They don\u2019t protect young girls.\u201d She said she saw the events of Christmas 2019, and her relationship with Burton, as triggers of a wider crisis her daughter was facing prompted by low self-esteem and her high profile. \u201cCarrie\u2019s state of mind was such that any of those things could have done it,\u201d she said. \u201cShe just hated the thought that people thought she was this awful person.\u201d Jody said she \u201cused to tell Carrie she should do a different job. But she always just proved me wrong.

Brighton were 10 points away after Fulham\u2019s draw with West Ham last month; now the teams are separated only by goal difference, with Newcastle and Burnley not much more distant. After this match, seven of Fulham\u2019s last nine games are against teams no higher than ninth; their last two home games are against Burnley and Newcastle. In short, there are plenty of reasons for optimism for Scott Parker and his side, and there\u2019s not much Manchester City can do to change that.

That may be terribly dispiriting for a young forward who at times has been integral to this team, but it might also allow the American to approach the end of the campaign with motivation high and tiredness low. At the same stage last season he was coming to the end of a long absence through injury and lockdown, andreturned for the final nine league games, scoring four goals and creating four more, his best run of form for Chelsea. Whether Tuchel will allow him the chance at a similar burst of form is another matter. \u201cI can say nothing but good things about him,\u201d said Tuchel this week. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a lack of trust or quality, it is just that he will have to be patient.\u201d SB \n \n Leeds United v Chelsea (Saturday, 12.30pm) \n \n \n  \n  \n  Christian Pulisic has been largely restricted to substitute appearances under Thomas Tuchel. \n  Photograph: Dave Shopland/IPS/Shutterstock \n  \n \n3) Derby day will offer measure of Arsenal progress \nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that Sam Allardyce took over at West Brom and declared the Baggies would be scrapping with Arsenal in a relegation dogfight. Results for Mikel Arteta\u2019s men have been somewhat mixed since then, but good enough to vault them into the top half. Defeat Spurs and they would draw to within two points of Liverpool, who meet Wolves on Monday, and four behind Tottenham. With fixtures against West Ham and the defending champions also looming, Arteta has a perfect opportunity to demonstrate his claim that the Gunners\u2019 league position belies the progress they are making. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s men have been gathering a momentum of their own just lately and if Gareth Bale\u2019s revival continues, it would be no surprise to see Tottenham\u2019s attacking firepower win the day. LM \n \n Arsenal v Tottenham (Sunday, 4.30pm) \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n4) Phillips and Kabak offer Klopp some stability \nWith Monday\u2019s trip to Molineux a welcome trip away from Liverpool\u2019s historic Anfield hoodoo, J\u00fcrgen Klopp will hope for a continuation of the improvements seen in Budapest during the \u201chome\u201d Champions League defeat of RB Leipzig. Nat Phillips received plaudits for his performance in the centre of defence alongside Ozan Kabak, the Schalke loanee far more comfortable against Bundesliga opposition than he has been in the Premier League. Fabinho starting in midfield for the first time in months certainly aided the youthful pair, as well as the overall balance of the team. Phillips was noticeably more decisive and assured than in that latest home defeat to Fulham last Sunday; Wednesday was perhaps the most confident Liverpool have looked defensively since Virgil van Dijk\u2019s injury. After 20 different defensive pairings this season, against a Wolves attack struggling for goals, Klopp is likely to plump for continuity and giving the fledgling partnership a run together.

But he has so far started both his games against Sean Dyche\u2019s Burnley with three centre-backs, beginning with his first game as Everton manager in December 2019 and continuing when the teams met last December. On that occasion, however, a first-half injury to left wing-back Fabian Delph forced him to change shape, the team looked much better after their reorganisation (with Alex Iwobi as a makeshift right-back) and they did not change back again for more than two months. Recently Everton have beaten Liverpool and lost to Chelsea with three at the back, while beating Southampton and West Brom with four. It will be interesting to see which way Ancelotti goes here, though the return of S\u00e9amus Coleman should at least spare Iwobi further full-back action. SB \n \n Everton v Burnley (Saturday, 5.30pm) \n \n6) Moyes can walk tall again at Old Trafford \nAlmost seven years on from his sacking by Manchester United, David Moyes travels back to Old Trafford with his West Ham team in fifth place and his reputation replenished. Moyes has not beaten United since he was Everton\u2019s manager, on the opening weekend of the 2012-13 season. He has faced them seven times since, drawing twice with West Ham; this may be his best chance yet to get a win. In east London, Moyes has shown why he was Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s chosen successor by producing a hard-working team greater than the sum of their parts. He has aided Declan Rice\u2019s development into one of the best midfielders in the country while Craig Dawson, a 30-year-old centre-back surplus to requirements at West Brom, has reminded of Moyes\u2019 ability to polish unlikely diamonds. Those traumatic nine months at United can never be wiped away but Moyes is again showing there was always a good manager within him.

This is a campaign that could still go either way for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 men: should they exit the Cup in their quarter-final against Manchester United a week on Sunday, soon after departing the Europa League, that would leave only a top-four finish to play for. Thomas Tuchel\u2019s Chelsea are breathing down their necks, looking increasingly likely to finish strongly, so the next few weeks will be a test of Rodgers\u2019 managerial skills as well as the character of his injury-hit squad. Another late-season slump in the Premier League would be dispiriting, and in view of the form being shown by Tuchel\u2019s men, West Ham and others, the Foxes cannot realistically afford to pass up the chance of three points against the league\u2019s bottom club.

Southampton followed up Saturday\u2019s precious win at rock-bottom Sheffield United with a midweek thrashing at Manchester City. They did not play too badly but every defensive mistake was punished. Only the hapless Blades have picked up fewer points in the last five games than Brighton, and their slide down towards the bottom three owes plenty to individual mistakes. Leicester\u2019s win at the Amex last week came after Robert S\u00e1nchez\u2019s goalkeeping error presented Daniel Amartey with a tap-in. That Graham Potter\u2019s team had nothing to show for what had been a decent performance has become one of the most common refrains of this season. There is little doubt that Brighton are now in danger, sitting level on points with Fulham with a game in hand. On Sunday, Potter may have to hope Southampton make more mistakes.

But the government has so far resisted such measures for greater Paris. \n  In the Paris region, the number of people in ICU units is now close to 1,100 and could reach 1,500 by the end of March if the current trend continues, Veran said, adding that level would be \u201ccritical\u201d for the area\u2019s hospital system. \n  \n \n \n  7.37pm GMT  \n  \n  AstraZeneca said it had found no evidence of an increased risk of pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis in safety data of more than 10 million records, even when considering subgroups based on age, gender, production batch or country of use. \n  \u201cIn fact, the observed number of these types of events are significantly lower in those vaccinated than what would be expected among the general population,\u201d it added. \n  Health authorities in Denmark, Norway and Iceland on Thursday suspended the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine following reports of the formation of blood clots in some people who had been vaccinated. \n  Austria earlier stopped using a batch of AstraZeneca shots while investigating a death from coagulation disorders and an illness from a pulmonary embolism. \n  The European medicine regulator EMA said the vaccine\u2019s benefits outweighed its risks and could continue to be administered. \n  \n \n \n  7.19pm GMT  \n  \n  Brazil\u2019s hospitals are faltering as a highly contagious coronavirus variant tears through the country. \n  For the last week, Brazilian governors sought to do something President Jair Bolsonaro obstinately rejects: cobble together a proposal for states to help curb the nation\u2019s deadliest Covid-19 outbreak yet. \n   Piaui state\u2019s governor Wellington Dias told The Associated Press that unless pressure on hospitals is eased, growing numbers of patients will have to endure the disease without a hospital bed or any hope of treatment in an intensive care unit.  \n  \u201cWe have reached the limit across Brazil; rare are the exceptions,\u201d Dias, who leads the governors\u2019 forum, said. \u201cThe chance of dying without assistance is real.\u201d  \n  In Brazil\u2019s wealthiest state, Sao Paulo, at least 30 patients died this month while waiting for ICU beds, according to a tally published Wednesday by the news site G1.  \n  Occupancy of ICUs is above 90% in 15 of 27 capitals, according to the state-run Fiocruz institute. \n  In southern Santa Catarina state, 419 people were waiting for transfer to ICU beds. \n  Neighbouring Rio Grande do Sul\u2019s capacity was at 106%. Alexandre Zavascki, a doctor in its capital, described a constant arrival of hospital patients struggling to breathe. \n  \n Updated at 7.22pm GMT \n \n \n  7.06pm GMT  \n  \n  Hungary said it was paying the equivalent of about $37.50 per dose for Chinese company Sinopharm\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine and $9.95 per dose for the Russian Sputnik-V vaccine. \n  \u201cHungary\u2019s government stands for making vaccine contracts public,\u201d Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s chief of staff Gergely Gulyas wrote on Facebook, attaching 30 pages of documents that appeared to be the vaccine contracts.  \n  \u201cWe ask the European Commission that it also publish the contracts signed by Brussels,\u201d Gulyas added.  \n  Hungary was the first EU nation to buy and use Chinese or Russian jabs and initially came under fire for its separate approval process and negotiations for the vaccines. More recently, several European countries have also expressed interest in buying those vaccines as shipments from Western suppliers lagged, Reuters reports. \n  Hungary used multiple suppliers to secure the most vaccines per capita in the EU, and also inoculated the highest number of people per capita in Europe, according to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). \n  It has only used 65% of its available vaccines as supply has risen in recent weeks. \n  Orban wants to immunise as many people as he can quickly to be able to reopen the country after a new lockdown imposed this week, closing all schools and most shops in an effort to contain a record rise of coronavirus cases. \n  Hungary\u2019s latest data showed a record 8,312 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, with 172 deaths. \n  \n \n \n  6.48pm GMT  \n  \n  Rwanda\u2019s president Paul Kagame today became the first leader in East Africa to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, which has been rolled out in the region in recent days, his office announced. \n  Kagame, 63, and his wife Jeannette, were pictured receiving their jabs along with a statement saying that 230,000 people had received the vaccine in the country. \n  The nation of 12 million has carried out more than a million tests and detected almost 20,000 cases, with 271 deaths since the outbreak of the virus. \n   \n   \n    As part of the ongoing nationwide vaccination rollout that has seen more than 230,000 people vaccinated, President Kagame and First Lady Jeannette Kagame received their #COVID-19 vaccines at King Faisal Hospital. pic.twitter.com/OylatTad9W\u2014 Presidency | Rwanda (@UrugwiroVillage) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.39pm GMT  \n  \n  Nearly 12 million women in poorer countries lost access to contraception in the pandemic, leading to 1.4 million unplanned pregnancies, the United Nations has said. \n  Reuters on estimates by the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, which show women lost access to contraception as the pandemic drew resources away from family planning or hit supply chains. Women also lost out due to coronavirus travel restrictions, clinic closures and stay-at-home orders, the UNFPA said.  \n  Agency head Natalia Kanem said: \n   \n   We must ensure that women and girls have uninterrupted access to life-saving contraceptives and maternal health medicines. The devastating impact that COVID-19 has had on the lives of millions of women and girls in the past year underscores just how vital it is to ensure the continuity of reproductive health services.\u201d \n   \n  The UN data highlighted the many ways in which women have suffered disproportionately in the pandemic, be it through greater job losses, increased domestic duties or rising incidents of domestic and sexual violence. In 115 low- and middle-income countries, women faced an average disruption in their family planning services of 3.6 months over the past year, UNFPA data showed. \n  \n \n \n  6.06pm GMT  \n Summary \n  \n  Here are some of the biggest stories from the past seven hours. \n   \n   Europe\u2019s medicines regulator (EMA) said there appeared to be no higher risk of blood clots in those vaccinated against Covid-19 (see 3.38pm), after Denmark, Norway and Iceland suspended use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab (see 1.48pm) and another five European countries withdrew a batch (see 2.21pm). \n   \n   \n   The governor of Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo, declared a two-week emergency shutdown as the South American country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak continues to spiral out of control (see 4.55pm). \n   \n   \n   Slovakia\u2019s health minister announced his resignation in an attempt to defuse a political crisis over the government\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic and a row over the purchase of vaccines from Russia (see 4.08pm). \n   \n   \n   Pfizer and BioNTech said that real-world data from Israel suggests that their vaccine is 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections, meaning the vaccine could significantly reduce transmission (see 11.52am). \n   \n   \n   The Portuguese parliament extended a state of emergency until the end of March as the government geared up to unveil a long-awaited plan to gradually lift strict lockdown rules in place since mid-January (see 5.09pm). \n   \n   \n   The EMA recommended conditionally approving Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s single dose Covid vaccine, following authorisations in the US and Canada (see 1.34pm). \n   \n   \n   The Polish capital, Warsaw, will be among cities facing tougher restrictions from Monday, the country\u2019s health minister said (see 2.54pm), as several central European nations face surges in infections. \n   \n   \n   Delaying the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be urgently reviewed for cancer patients after a single shot was found to offer inadequate protection, researchers said. \n   \n   \n   France is to ease some Covid restrictions on international travel outside Europe, the foreign ministry said. Travellers to or from Australia, South Korea, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Britain and Singapore will no longer have to need a compelling reason to travel. \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.34pm GMT \n \n \n  5.50pm GMT  \n  \n  Not everyone in Texas, US, is ready to embrace the end of mandatory mask wearing, with most people who wandered in and out of stores still donning face coverings, and many shops requiring customers to wear one before entering. \n   \n    Related: 'It\u2019s every man for himself': the Texans defying end of mask mandate   \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.51pm GMT \n \n \n  5.36pm GMT  \n  \n  Charities in Africa have criticised the more economically developed nations for blocking efforts to waive patents for Covid vaccines, claiming that the current system appears designed to foster the interests of pharmaceutical giants. \n  Reuters reports that more than 40 charities, including Amnesty International and Christian Aid, said yesterday\u2019s move by Western nations to prevent generic or other manufacturers making more vaccines in poorer nations was \u201can affront on people\u2019s right to healthcare\u201d. \n  Peter Kamalingin, Oxfam International\u2019s Africa director, told a news conference: \u201cEnsuring every African can get a safe and effective Covid vaccine ... is the most effective way to save lives and livelihoods, keep our children in school, reduce unemployment rates and re-open our economies.\u201d  \n  Richer members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) blocked a push by some 80 developing countries \u2013 led by India and South Africa \u2013 to waive its Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement rules on patents. \n  The move sent a message that African lives were less important than those of people in rich nations, Kamalingin said. \n  Countries such as the US and Britain argue that protecting intellectual property rights encourages research and innovation, and that suspending those rights would not result in a sudden surge of vaccine supply. However, critics say that it is imperative that as many vaccine doses are made as quick as possible, now there are a number of viable jabs, particularly given that so much taxpayers money was used to fund research and development. \n  \u201cBig Pharma will praise the \u2018well functioning\u2019 patent system forever. It makes them very rich,\u201d tweeted campaigner Nick Dearden, from Global Justice Now. \u201cBut Covid-19 shows it is no basis for a fair and healthy world. We need a very different model.\u201d \n  Africa accounts for less than 4% of the 118 million cases and 2.6 million deaths recorded globally, but some health experts believe the true figures may be larger. \n  \n Updated at 6.20pm GMT \n \n \n  5.29pm GMT  \n  \n  At the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic, some workers found themselves at home, momentarily (at least they thought) liberated from the many impositions of office work \u2013 including commuting. Now, instead of waking up early, getting dressed and schlepping to the office and back, people had time to do anything they want. Which is why it might be surprising that some are still pretending to commute. \n   \n    Related: Meet the 'faux commuters' taking fake trips to work during the pandemic   \n   \n  \n \n \n  5.09pm GMT  \n Portugal extends state of emergency \n  \n  The Portuguese parliament has extended a state of emergency until the end of March as the government geared up to unveil a long-awaited plan to gradually lift strict lockdown rules in place since mid-January. \n  Reuters has the story: \n   \n   Under the lockdown implemented on 15 January to tackle what was then the world\u2019s worst surge of coronavirus cases and deaths, all non-essential services and schools were shut, with people urged to stay home across Portugal. \n   The situation brought the country\u2019s fragile health service to its knees but has significantly improved since then, with daily figures dropping sharply.  \n   The plan to ease the lockdown will be announced by the government later today and is expected to slowly open up different services and allow certain activities depending on the pandemic situation in each region. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.15pm GMT \n \n \n  5.04pm GMT  \n  \n  Sweden\u2019s crown princess Victoria, next in the line of succession to the throne, and her husband, Daniel, have tested positive for coronavirus, the royal court has said. \n  \u201cThe crown princess and prince Daniel display mild symptoms, but are feeling well considering the circumstances,\u201d the Swedish court said in a statement. \n  As crown princess, Victoria, 40, is next in the line to succeed her father, King Karl XIV Gustaf.  \n  \n Updated at 6.04pm GMT \n \n \n  4.55pm GMT  \n Two week shutdown in S\u00e3o Paulo as outbreak spirals out of control \n  \n  The governor of Brazil\u2019s most populous state, S\u00e3o Paulo, has declared a two-week emergency shutdown as the South American country\u2019s coronavirus outbreak continues to spiral out of control.\u201cBrazil is collapsing,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Doria warned on Thursday afternoon as he announced the new restrictions in his state, which is home to 44 million of Brazil\u2019s 212 million citizens. \u201cThis is the only \u2013 I repeat \u2013 only way right now to try and stop the acceleration of deaths and avoid so many families being devastated, as has been happening everyday, here and across Brazil,\u201d Doria added. \n  S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s health secretary, Jean Gorinchteyn, said intense pressure on hospitals and a 12% surge in fatalities in the last week meant authorities had no choice but to order the closure of businesses, beaches, parks, schools and churches. As of next Monday, a curfew will also be enforced between 8pm and 5am.Gorinchteyn said there were currently more than 9,000 Covid patients in S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s intensive care units \u2013 many of them young Brazilians in their twenties and thirties. An average of 150 people were being admitted to intensive care each day, he said. \u201cWe all need to understand that what is happening right now is a different pandemic to the one we saw last year,\u201d Gorinchteyn told journalists.S\u00e3o Paulo is one of the Brazilian states worst-hit by Covid, having lost more than 63,000 lives.

Frustration has grown after months of wearying shutdowns, and the country\u2019s 16 federal states have increasingly gone their own way, leading to a patchwork of rules. A scandal over the procurement of face masks early on in the pandemic has added to a toxic mix for the conservatives. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.20pm GMT \n \n \n  4.19pm GMT  \n  \n  Azerbaijan plans to import 432,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and 300,000 doses of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine over the next half year. \n  The former Soviet nation of 10 million people has not formally registered either of those vaccines for use. Azerbaijan has already bought 4 million doses of China\u2019s Sinovac vaccine and began a voluntary vaccine programme on 18 January. It will also receive 2 million doses through the Covax international scheme. \n  \n \n \n  4.08pm GMT  \n  \n  Slovakia\u2019s health minister has announced his resignation in a bid to defuse a political crisis over the government\u2019s mishandling of the pandemic. \n  \u201cTwo minor coalition parties conditioned their stay in government on my resignation.

They were offered testing in response to the initial cases. Specialist contact tracing teams have undertaken a comprehensive investigation to identify any further contacts and additional testing has been in place since the initial cases were identified. \n   The individual in Bradford tested positive for Covid-19 in late February after travelling back from Brazil via Paris on 14 February. Subsequent genomic sequencing confirmed the case as the P.1 variant. Contact tracing teams have followed up close contacts of the individual and advised them to isolate and get a test. \n   The latest cases bring the total number of P.1 variant cases in the UK to ten \u2013 seven in England and three in Scotland, all of which have links to travel or to a previously confirmed case that has travelled to Brazil. \n   \n  \n \n \n  2.58pm GMT  \n  \n  Turkey plans to vaccinate 50 million people by autumn, Reuters quotes its health minister, Fahrettin Koca, as saying, after the number of daily cases surged to their highest level this year. \n   \n   Turkey, with a population of 83 million, has carried out 10.56m inoculations since 14 January, when it began the nationwide rollout of Covid-19 shots developed by China\u2019s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. \n   \u201cIf we can vaccinate 50 million of our population before autumn as we plan, the pandemic will no longer be a heavy burden for us,\u201d Koca said in a live televised statement on the anniversary of the first Covid-19 case recorded in Turkey. \n   There have been 2.82m recorded cases in Turkey and more than 29,000 people have died there due to Covid-19, health ministry data shows. \n   Koca said 42 of Turkey\u2019s provinces were currently assessed to be low and medium-risk areas, while 39 provinces were registered as high or very high-risk areas. \n   The number of new cases stood at 14,556 on Wednesday, the highest since the end of 2020 and nearly double the levels a month ago. Ten days earlier, the president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan announced an easing of measures to curb the pandemic. \n   Erdo\u011fan announced a partial opening of schools, cafes and restaurants on Monday last week. Ankara also eased weekend lockdowns, after the number of new cases fell below 10,000 daily. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.59pm GMT \n \n \n  2.54pm GMT  \n  \n  The Polish capital, Warsaw, will be among cities facing tougher restrictions from Monday, the country\u2019s health minister has said, as several central European nations face surges in infections. \n  According to Reuters, tighter limitations on public life will be enforced in two more Polish regions as well. The agency reports: \n   \n   A highly contagious variant of the virus first identified in Britain has driven spiralling infection rates in Poland, with Thursday\u2019s total of 21,045 coronavirus cases bringing the pandemic back to levels not seen since November. \n   \u201cWhen we look at the pandemic situation, it looks like this increase does not show any signs of slowing down,\u201d said the health minister, Adam Niedzielski, as he announced the return of stricter curbs in the central Mazowieckie region and Lubuskie in the west. \n   From Monday, these regions will have to close hotels, cinemas, swimming pools and shopping malls while children in the first three school grades will partly switch to online learning. \n   Mazowieckie and Lubuskie will join the northern regions of Warminsko-Mazurskie and Pomorskie as areas with the tightest restrictions. \n   Poland eased some restrictions last month, reopening ski slopes, as well as cinemas, hotels and theatres for up to 50% capacity, which initially resulted in massive tourist visits to popular ski resorts. \n   The government then resumed curbs in the northern regions as they reported a higher infection rate per 100,000 people than other parts of the country. \n   Niedzielski did not rule out a return to tougher rules across the entire country. \u201cAt the moment, we have decided to introduce restrictions in these two regions, but there is indeed a possibility ... that the next restrictions will be introduced nationwide.\u201d \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.44pm GMT \n \n \n  2.21pm GMT  \n  \n  Italy\u2019s decision to ban a batch of AstraZeneca vaccine was taken following the deaths of two men in Sicily who had recently been inoculated, a source close to the matter has told Reuters. The agency reports: \n   \n   Italy\u2019s medicines authority Aifa said earlier that the ban was a \u201cprecautionary\u201d measure, adding that no link had been established between the vaccine and subsequent \u201cserious adverse events\u201d. \n   The source said Aifa had moved after Stefano Paterno, a 43-year-old navy officer, died earlier this week of a suspected heart attack the day after his jab. \n   A second man, 50-year-old policeman Davide Villa, died last weekend, some 12 days after his jab. Local newspapers reported he fell ill within 24 hours of his injection and never recovered. \n   The source said both men had received shots from AstraZeneca\u2019s ABV2856 batch. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.42pm GMT \n \n \n  2.04pm GMT  \n  \n  The UK\u2019s medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (MHRA) has stressed that it was not confirmed that the reported blood clot in Denmark was caused by the vaccine, adding that the Danish suspension was precautionary. \n  Phil Bryan, MHRA vaccines safety lead, said more than 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered across the UK and that reports of blood clots were not greater than would have occurred naturally. \n   \n   Blood clots can occur naturally and are not uncommon ... We are keeping this issue under close review but available evidence does not confirm that the vaccine is the cause. People should still go and get their Covid-19 vaccine when asked to do so. \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.48pm GMT  \n Norway and Iceland latest to halt AstraZeneca jab rollout \n  \n  Norway and Iceland has suspended the rollout of AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid-19 vaccine, following a similar move by Denmark (see 12.51pm). \n  \u201cThis is a cautionary decision,\u201d Geir Bukholm, director of infection prevention and control at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, told a news conference. \u201cWe ... await information to see if there is a link between the vaccination and this case with a blood clot.\u201d \n  Italy has also said it would suspend use of the AstraZeneca batch that was used in Austria, after the country suspended use of a particular batch of the drug because a woman died from blood clots 10 days after taking it. \n  \n Updated at 1.59pm GMT \n \n \n  1.44pm GMT  \n  \n  The EU\u2019s drugs regulator has recommended conditionally approving Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s single dose Covid vaccine, following authorisations in the US and Canada. \n  Results from a trial of about 44,000 participants show the jab was 66% effective in preventing moderate-to-severe Covid globally. \n  The shot is the fourth to be endorsed for use in the EU after vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech , AstraZeneca-Oxford University and Moderna, and is recommended for those over 18, the European Medicines agency (EMA) said. \n  EMA executive director Emer Cooke said. \n   \n   With this latest positive opinion, authorities across the European Union will have another option to combat the pandemic and protect the lives and health of their citizens. This is the first vaccine that can be used as a single dose.\u201d \n   \n  EU conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year without full data on its efficacy and side-effects being available. \n  \n Updated at 1.57pm GMT \n \n \n  1.28pm GMT  \n  \n  A small study, and the first real-world piece of research in the area, suggests cancer patients could be much less protected against Covid-19 than others after one dose of the Pfizer jab. \n  Gemma Peters, the chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said:  \n   \n   We have been concerned about how much protection the vaccines will give people with blood cancer because vaccines do not usually work as well for people with compromised immune systems. This study, while not peer reviewed and only looking at a small number of people, is worrying news in that it adds to that concern.  \n   This means that if you have blood cancer, it is important that you do not assume you have protection even after you have had the vaccine, particularly after just one dose, and that you continue being careful to avoid Covid. But while this news is concerning, people with blood cancer should still definitely have the vaccine, as it is safe and even a smaller chance of protection is much better than none. \n   \n  She called for further research, which she said the UK government has neither prioritised nor funded, and urged officials to consider whether cancer patients should receive the second dose sooner. \n  The BBC has the full story. \n  \n Updated at 1.31pm GMT \n \n \n  1.22pm GMT  \n  \n  Austria has embarked on a drive to inoculate residents of a district that has been particularly hard-hit by the virus variant first found in South Africa, a move that is part of a research project into vaccinations. \n  AP reports: \n   \n   Around 48,500 of the 64,000 people eligible for vaccinations in Tyrol province\u2019s Schwaz district have signed up to get shots and the goal is to have them all done by Monday, Schwaz mayor Hand Lintner told reporters. A second shot will be given four weeks later. \n   The district, east of the provincial capital of Innsbruck and home to about 84,000 people, has been a source of concern for weeks. It has seen the majority of the cases of the more transmissible variant in the province, peaking at 193 active confirmed cases of it, before dropping down to a current 47, authorities said. \n   In addition to protecting the people of Schwaz, the idea of the programme, overseen in part by the Medical University of Innsbruck, is to collect data on how well the vaccine protects people and in particular how effective it is on the South African variant. \u201cFor us here today, it is a day of joy,\u201d Lintner said. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.32pm GMT \n \n \n  1.15pm GMT  \n UK government says AstraZeneca vaccine is 'safe and effective' \n  \n  The UK government has defended the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after Denmark suspended the jab\u2019s use (see 12.51pm), and insisted it would continue with its own rollout. \n  Prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s spokesman told reporters:  \n   \n   We\u2019ve been clear that it\u2019s both safe and effective... and when people are asked to come forward and take it, they should do so in confidence. And in fact you\u2019re starting to see the results of the vaccine programme in terms of the [lower] number of cases we\u2019re seeing across the country, the number of deaths, number of hospitalisations. \n   \n  He noted that Denmark had stressed there was no confirmed link between the vaccine and the blood clots. \n  Asked if the UK government\u2019s medical and scientific advisers were in contact with Denmark, the Downing Street spokesman said it was \u201cregular practice\u201d for experts to exchange information with international counterparts. \n  \n Updated at 1.22pm GMT \n \n \n  1.04pm GMT  \n France to ease restrictions on international travel from some countries \n  \n  France is to ease some Covid restrictions on international travel outside Europe, the foreign ministry has said. Travellers to or from Australia, South Korea, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, Britain and Singapore will no longer have to need a compelling reason to travel. \n  All other restrictions, such as a requirement for a negative Covid-19 test less than 72 hours before travel, would remain in place, the ministry said, adding that a decree was due to be published on 12 March. \n  \n Updated at 1.23pm GMT \n \n \n  12.51pm GMT  \n  \n  Here\u2019s more on Denmark\u2019s two-week suspension of the use of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine after reports of the formation of blood clots in some who have been vaccinated, including one death. \n  Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said: \n   \n   This is a super-cautious approach based on some isolated reports in Europe. The problem with spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions to a vaccine are the enormous difficulty of distinguishing a causal effect from a coincidence. \n   \n  AstraZeneca said the safety of its vaccine had been extensively studied in human trials, and peer-reviewed data had confirmed the vaccine was generally well tolerated. \n  The drugmaker said earlier this week its shots were subject to strict and rigorous quality controls and that there had been \u201cno confirmed serious adverse events associated with the vaccine\u201d.  \n  It said it was in contact with Austrian authorities and would fully support their investigation after the country suspended use of a particular batch of the drug because a woman died from blood clots 10 days after taking it. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Luxembourg also stopped using the batch. \n  \u201cWe do not think that there is sufficient evidence to stop vaccination with AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine,\u201d Veronica Arthurson, head of drug safety at the Swedish Medical Products Agency, told Newsagency TT. \n  Here\u2019s the full story: \n   \n    Related: Denmark pauses use of AstraZeneca vaccine to investigate blood clot reports  \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.56pm GMT \n \n \n  12.33pm GMT  \n  \n  Iran has received a shipment of 150,000 doses of an Indian Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, local media has reported, as the Islamic republic combats the Middle East\u2019s deadliest outbreak of the illness. \n  \u201cThe coronavirus vaccine shipment from India arrived at [Tehran\u2019s] Imam Khomeini airport containing 150,000 doses,\u201d deputy customs chief Mehrdad Jamal Arvanaghi told ISNA news agency. \n  AFP reports: \n   \n   Iran, which is in its second month of a vaccination campaign, is to receive another 375,000 doses from India next week, the health ministry\u2019s public relations head, Kianoush Jahanpour, announced on Twitter. \n   Tehran, using multiple sources, started its national vaccination campaign on 9 February, but the number of people inoculated to date has not been announced. It has bought a total of 2m doses of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V, according to Jahanpour, to be delivered in stages. \n   He said Tehran plans to launch the local manufacture of the Russian jab before the start of the new Iranian year on 21 March. \u201c36 to 40 million doses of Sputnik V will be produced and distributed\u201d in the upcoming year, he was quoted as saying on the government\u2019s website. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.46pm GMT \n \n \n  12.15pm GMT  \n  \n  AFP reports on growing calls grew for the UK to share any surplus coronavirus jabs with Ireland to address the gulf in the vaccination rollouts in the neighbouring countries. \n  Northern Ireland\u2019s first minister Arlene Foster said the lagging vaccination programme in the Republic of Ireland was \u201ca concern\u201d which could undermine immunity efforts in the British nation she governs. \n  While Northern Ireland has benefited from the UK\u2019s speedy vaccine programme, Ireland has been tethered to an EU rollout hampered by production and supply issues. \n  Northern Ireland \u2013 home to 1.9 million \u2013 has delivered 650,000 doses to residents, according to latest official figures. The Republic of Ireland is lagging far behind, having delivered just 525,000 doses to a far larger population of 4.9 million. \n  Yesterday, Irish prime minister Micheal Martin was battered by opposition lawmakers in debates over the nation\u2019s slow vaccine rollout. \u201cThere is no magic tree out there that we can pick vaccines off. That is an illusion,\u201d he said in the D\u00e1il, the country\u2019s lower chamber of parliament. \n  He said he had contacted Johnson who said \u201che does not have surplus vaccines to give to Ireland right now\u201d. \n  \n Updated at 12.36pm GMT \n \n \n  12.05pm GMT  \n  \n  The EU\u2019s medicines regulator has said it has started a review of US drug maker Eli Lilly\u2019s mix of two synthetic antibodies to treat high-risk Covid-19 patients. \n  AFP reports: \n   \n   The company says trials have shown that bamlanivimab and etesevimab reduce hospitalisations and deaths in coronavirus patients. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said it had started a \u201crolling review\u201d of the two antibodies used in combination, and of bamlanivimab used alone. \n   The start of the rolling review is a precursor to accelerated authorisation for use within the EU. \u201cThe decision to start the rolling review is based on preliminary results from two studies,\u201d the Amsterdam-based regulator said. The EMA has started evaluating the first batch of data, which come from animal studies, it said. \n   Bamlanivimab and etesevimab are monoclonal antibodies, which are lab-made versions of the body\u2019s natural infection-fighting defences. Giving people ready-made antibodies can help those who are at high risk of severe disease because of weak immunity or underlying conditions. \n   \n  \n Updated at 12.35pm GMT \n \n \n  11.52am GMT  \n  \n  Pfizer and BioNTech have said that real-world data from Israel suggests that their vaccine is 94% effective in preventing asymptomatic infections, meaning the vaccine could significantly reduce transmission. \n  The data, collected between 17 January and 6 March, has not yet been peer reviewed. The companies also said the latest analysis of the Israeli data showed the vaccine was 97% effective in preventing symptomatic disease, severe disease and death, Reuters reports. That is basically in line with the 95% efficacy Pfizer and BioNTech reported from the vaccine\u2019s late-stage clinical trial in December. \n  According to the analysis, unvaccinated individuals were 44 times more likely to develop symptomatic Covid and 29 times more likely to die from Covid than those who had received the vaccine. \n  \n Updated at 12.29pm GMT \n \n \n  11.44am GMT  \n  \n  Artefacts and memories of the deadliest global pandemic in a century are on display in Miami, US, in what is probably the nation\u2019s first comprehensive coronavirus museum exhibition, forming an enduring testament to an unprecedented era. \n   \n    Related: \u2018The year that transformed the world\u2019: US museum launches Covid exhibition  \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.29am GMT  \n  \n  Rolls-Royce has reported a loss of \u00a34bn for 2020 as the jet-engine manufacturer\u2019s business was shaken by the coronavirus pandemic, as revenues from servicing passenger aircraft collapsed.

Schools and most shops had followed in mid-December. \n  But epidemiologists, pointing to more contagious virus variants as well as surging infection rates in Germany\u2019s neighbouring countries like the Czech Republic or Poland, have repeatedly warned against easing the partial lockdown too early. \n  At the same time, Wieler said there are encouraging signs that a vaccination campaign was already starting to show effect. \n  \u201cWe see effects already in those who are over 80. The incidence (rate of infection) is on the decline, tremendously,\u201d he said. \n  Germany focussed on vaccinating the oldest within its population when it began its innoculation campaign late December, but criticism has grown over the pace of the rollout as the country lags Britain or the United States. \n  \n Updated at 9.37am GMT \n \n \n  9.12am GMT  \n  \n  Premier Li Keqiang says China will continue to work with the World Health Organization (WHO) in trying to find the origins of Covid-19, Reuters reports. \n  Keqiang was speaking in response to a question on U.S. criticism that it was not transparent in sharing data on early cases with a WHO investigation earlier this year. \n  Speaking at a media briefing to mark the end of China\u2019s annual session of parliament, he said China had \u201cacted in a fact-based manner and with an open, transparent and cooperative approach\u201d. \n  Keqiang also denied that the government\u2019s 2021 goal for economic growth of more than 6% is not a low target.

successful that it has been stopped early. \n   GSK and its partner, Vir Biotechnology, plan to immediately seek an emergency use authorisation in the United States and approval in other countries, including potentially in the UK. \n   Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced molecules that mimic human antibodies. \n   The global phase 3 clinical trial based its initial analysis on data from 583 patients at risk of hospital admission. \n   GSK said VIR-7831 works in two ways - by blocking the virus\u2019s entry into healthy cells and also clearing infected cells. \n   A separate laboratory study has found that VIR-7831 is effective against the main current Covid-19 variants, including the Kent, South African and Brazilian variants, the firm said. \n   VIR-7831 is designed to

a \u201csemantic debate\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t really matter\u201d because people would receive protection against Covid-19 from the first dose. \n  \n \n \n  7.18am GMT  \n  \n  Hi, Alex Mistlin here taking over our global coronavirus coverage.  \n  First up, the pandemic has had a devastating impact on nature conservation efforts, reports AFP.  \n   \n   The Covid-19 pandemic has not only had devastating effects on humans, it has also heavily impacted efforts to safeguard natural ecosystems and habitats around the globe, conservationists warned Thursday. \n   The pandemic and its economic fall-out have put rangers out of work, forced cuts to anti-poaching patrols, and sparked a range of environmental roll-backs, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said. \n   A special edition of the IUCN\u2019s PARKS journal, containing a collection of new research papers on the pandemic\u2019s various impacts on nature conservation, indicated the crisis was being felt in protected areas worldwide. \n   \u201cWhile the global health crisis remains priority, this new research reveals just how severe a toll the Covid-19 pandemic has taken on conservation efforts and on communities dedicated to protecting nature,\u201d IUCN director general Dr Bruno Oberle said in the statement. \n   Surveys done of protected areas across 90 countries showed that in general the impacts had been most severe in Africa, as well as in Latin America and Asia. \n   More than half of Africa\u2019s protected areas reported they had been forced to halt or reduce field patrols and anti-poaching operations. \n   \n  \n \n \n  7.04am GMT  \n  \n  That\u2019s it from me, Helen Sullivan, and over to my colleague Alex Mistlin in London.  \n  \n \n \n  6.52am GMT  \n Cambodia reports its first coronavirus death \n  \n  Cambodia reported its first death from the coronavirus on Thursday amid its biggest Covid outbreak so far, after a 50-year-old man succumbed to the virus after testing positive less than two weeks ago.Reuters: With just 1,124 coronavirus infections recorded in total, Cambodia has among the fewest cases in Asia, although a sharp rise in infections since Feb. 20 has seen its overall tally more than double.The man died mid-morning local time on Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement.It said he tested positive on 27 February and was a driver for a Chinese national who lived in the coastal town of Sihanoukville, who was also infected.The Southeast Asian nation of about 16 million people is located next to Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, which have all been successful in keeping coronavirus outbreaks under control.Cambodia started its Covid vaccination programme last month. \n  \n \n \n  6.48am GMT  \n Summary \n  \n  Here are the key developments from the last few hours:  \n   \n   Brazil daily death toll passes 2,000 for first time. Brazil\u2019s 24-hour death toll has for the first time passed 2,0000, as the world\u2019s second worst-affected country in terms of the total lives lost sees records tumble.Another 2,286 Brazilians had lost their lives in the 24 hours to Wednesday. The latest high, which followed a record 1,972 deaths on Tuesday, took the South American country\u2019s total death toll to more than 270,000, second only to the US. \n   Biden pledges to share surplus vaccines with rest of world. US president Joe Biden has pledged surplus vaccines will be shared with the rest of the world, after he announced the purchase of an additional 100m Johnson &amp; Johnson doses.  \n   South Korea extends AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged 65 and over. South Korea will extend vaccination for people aged 65 years and older with AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine to ramp up its immunisation drive, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a government meeting on Thursday. \n   Rich, developing nations wrangle over Covid vaccine patents. Richer members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) blocked a push by over 80 developing countries on Wednesday to waive patent rights in an effort to boost production of Covid vaccines for poor nations. \n   Emirates tells staff to get vaccinated or pay for regular Covid tests. Dubai\u2019s Emirates has told employees to take a free coronavirus vaccine or pay for tests to prove they are not infected with the deadly disease, cautioning that an unvaccinated workforce could create operational issues. \n   3,000 nurses dead, Covid exodus looming: global federation. At least 3,000 nurses have been killed by Covid-19, the global nurses\u2019 federation said Thursday as it warned of a looming exodus of health workers traumatised by the pandemic, AFP reports. Exactly one year on since the World Health Organization (WHO) first described Covid-19 as a pandemic, the International Council of Nurses said burn-out and stress had led millions of nurses to consider quitting the profession. \n   Five countries suspend use of AstraZeneca vaccine. Austria\u2019s national medicines regulator has suspended use of a batch of the AstraZeneca vaccine after four patients were diagnosed with dangerous blood clotting conditions after receiving the jab, PA reports.Four other countries - Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia - have suspended its use to allow time for the EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) to conduct an investigation. \n   Covid cases put Ausralian Hospital under extreme pressure. An infux of Covid-19 patients from Papua New Guinea has sparked a \u201ccode yellow\u201d emergency at the Cairns Hospital in Australia, the ABC reports. The internal emergency declaration triggers strategies to help the hospital cope when it nears capacity. The six Covid-19 patients are all being treated in isolation, and came from hotel quarantine. \n   Taiwan in travel bubble talks. Taiwan officials have revealed they have been in talks since last year with several countries about the possibility of forming travel bubbles. It didn\u2019t make clear whether all the discussions were still going, given some of the countries had seen recent resurgences of Covid cases. \n   October deadline for vaccinating all Australians refers to first dose only. Opposition senators are probing health department officials the government\u2019s commitment that Australian adults would be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d by October. In fact, the health department secretary, Brendan Murphy\u2019s, evidence today is that every adult will have received the first dose of AstraZeneca, but maybe not everyone will have had the second dose.  \n   \n  \n \n \n  6.25am GMT  \n Emirates tells staff to get vaccinated or pay for regular Covid tests \n  \n  Dubai\u2019s Emirates has told employees to take a free coronavirus vaccine or pay for tests to prove they are not infected with the deadly disease, cautioning that an unvaccinated workforce could create operational issues.In an internal email, seen by Reuters, the airline told cabin crew that starting March 15, those not vaccinated must pay for a test valid for seven days to the start of flight or standby duty. The policy applies to all employees in the United Arab Emirates, an Emirates spokeswoman told Reuters, declining further comment. \n  \n \n \n  6.09am GMT  \n South Korea extends AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged 65 and over \n  \n  South Korea will extend vaccination for people aged 65 years and older with AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine to ramp up its immunisation drive, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a government meeting on Thursday.Reuters: The country has been rolling out the vaccine since the last week of February, beginning with the elderly and health workers, but had excluded more than 370,000 over-65s in nursing homes citing a lack of clinical trial data on the age group. Real-world data from Britain has now shown AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s vaccines are both more than 80% effective in preventing hospitalisations in over-80s after one shot. \n  \n \n \n  5.52am GMT  \n Rich, developing nations wrangle over Covid vaccine patents \n  \n  Richer members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) blocked a push by over 80 developing countries on Wednesday to waive patent rights in an effort to boost production of Covid vaccines for poor nations, Reuters reports.  \n  Western nations argue protecting intellectual property rights encouraged research and innovation and that suspending those rights would not result in a sudden surge of vaccine supply.In its eighth discussion on the topic since it was first raised in October, the WTO\u2019s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) Council spent three hours debating, but failed to agree.  \n  Proposals need backing by a consensus of the WTO\u2019s 164 members to pass. They did at least agree to discuss the matter twice again in April before the next scheduled Trips Council meeting on 8-9 June. \n  \n \n \n  5.24am GMT  \n  \n  Brazil\u2019s hospitals are faltering as a highly contagious coronavirus variant tears through the country, the president insists on unproven treatments and the only attempt to create a national plan to contain Covid has just fallen short, AP reports. For the last week, Brazilian governors sought to do something President Jair Bolsonaro obstinately rejects: cobble together a proposal for states to help curb the nation\u2019s deadliest Covid outbreak yet. The effort was expected to include a curfew, prohibition of crowded events and limits on the hours non-essential services can operate.The final product, presented Wednesday, was a one-page document that included general support for restricting activity but without any specific measures. Six governors, evidently still wary of antagonising Bolsonaro, declined to sign on.Piaui state\u2019s Gov. Wellington Dias told The Associated Press that, unless pressure on hospitals is eased, growing numbers of patients will have to endure the disease without a hospital bed or any hope of treatment in an intensive care unit.\u201cWe have reached the limit across Brazil; rare are the exceptions,\u201d Dias, who leads the governors\u2019 forum, said. \u201cThe chance of dying without assistance is real.\u201dThose deaths have already started. In Brazil\u2019s wealthiest state, Sao Paulo, at least 30 patients died this month while waiting for ICU beds, according to a tally published Wednesday by the news site G1. In southern Santa Catarina state, 419 people are waiting for transfer to ICU beds. In neighbouring Rio Grande do Sul, ICU capacity is at 106%. \n  \n \n \n  4.52am GMT  \n Biden pledges to share surplus vaccines with rest of world \n  \n  US president Joe Biden has pledged surplus vaccines will be shared with the rest of the world, after he announced the purchase of an additional 100m Johnson &amp; Johnson doses. \u201cIf we have a surplus, we\u2019re going to share it with the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not something that can be stopped by a fence no matter how high you build a fence or a wall. So we\u2019re not going to be safe until the world is safe. And so, we\u2019re going to start off making sure Americans are taken care of first, but we\u2019re then going to try and help the rest of the world.\u201d  \n  The president reiterated plans to have all American adults vaccinated by the end of May and revealed the country hit a record of 2.9m vaccinations in one day on Saturday \n   \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.43am GMT  \n Brazil daily death toll passes 2,000 for first time \n  \n  In case you missed this earlier: Brazil\u2019s 24-hour death toll has for the first time passed 2,0000, as the world\u2019s second worst-affected country in terms of the total lives lost sees records tumble.  \n  Another 2,286 Brazilians had lost their lives in the 24 hours to Wednesday. The latest high, which followed a record 1,972 deaths on Tuesday, took the South American country\u2019s total death toll to more than 270,000, second only to the US. \n  Hours earlier Brazil\u2019s former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, excoriated what he called President Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cmoronic\u201d and inept response to the pandemic.\u201cLots of these deaths could have been avoided had we had a government which had done basic things,\u201d Lula said, attacking how Bolsonaro had failed to buy vaccines and trivialized Covid-19 as a \u201clittle flu\u201d about which only only \u201cpansies\u201d and \u201ccowards\u201d were concerned.Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain, has shown scant sympathy for Brazilian victims of Covid, last week telling citizens to stop \u201cwhining\u201d about the pandemic.Speaking on Wednesday Lula said: \u201cI want to express my solidarity with the victims of coronavirus, the relatives of the victims ... and above all with the heroes and heroines of our public health service.\u201d\u201cHad it not been for our national health service we would have lost so many more people than we have lost,\u201d he added. \n  \n \n \n  4.32am GMT  \n  \n  Papua New Guinea has made facemasks compulsory as the country wrestles with an uncontrolled outbreak of community transmission of Covid-19. \n  The country\u2019s police commissioner, and national pandemic response controller, David Manning, said masks would be compulsory on public transport and in any enclosed public space. Businesses and government must provide masks for workers. \n  PNG\u2019s already fragile health system is on the verge of collapse, with swingeing budget cuts combining with surging infections of health care workers. Some hospitals have closed their doors, while others are running short of protective equipment for staff. \n  For the entire pandemic, PNG has recorded just 1741 cases, nearly half of which have been reported in the last five weeks. \n   \n    \n    \n    Papua New Guinea pandemic controller and police commissioner David Manning \n    Photograph: EMTV Papua New Guinea \n    \n   \n  But the real rate of infection is likely many times higher. Fewer than 50,000 tests have been conducted across the whole country for the entire pandemic, and in many places outside the capital there are no testing facilities at all. \n  Prof Glen Mola, the head of obstetrics and gynaecology at Port Moresby General Hospital said on facebook the situation at his hospital was critical. \n   \n   At PMGH the Covid ward is full. Patients are dying of Covid every day now. \n   We are trying to look after Covid patients in other wards because there is no space in the Covid ward. \n   These positive cases are now infecting the nurses and doctors. Last week we had to put 10 staff off work because of Covid infection - if more staff have to go off work, then we may not be able to keep the hospital open. I think even the \u2018naysayers\u2019 will agree that if PMGH closes there will be chaos in Port Moresby. \n   \n  \n \n \n  4.20am GMT  \n  \n  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 14,356 to 2,532,947 data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Thursday. \n  The reported death toll rose by 321 to 72,810, the tally showed. \n   \n    \n    \n    A sign indicates face masks are mandatory at a busy street crossing in Berlin. But many pedestrians are not wearing them. \n    Photograph: John MacDougall/AFP/Getty Images \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.48am GMT  \n October deadline for vaccinating all Australians refers to first dose only \n  \n  More on Australia\u2019s vaccination schedule: opposition senators are probing health department officials the government\u2019s commitment that Australian adults would be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d by October. \n  In fact, the health department secretary, Brendan Murphy\u2019s, evidence today is that every adult will have received the first dose of AstraZeneca, but maybe not everyone will have had the second dose. Is that a contradiction? \n  Murphy: \n   \n   I said vaccinated by the end of October because every Australian adult will be offered a vaccine by the end of October. If a small number haven\u2019t had their second AstraZeneca that doesn\u2019t really matter, they are fully protected by the first dose. It is entirely consistent with what the prime minister and minister have said in the media. \n   \n  Asked if \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d meant two doses, Murphy replied: \n   \n   ...to complete the program [yes] but in terms of protection the first dose is fully protective. \n   There is full population coverage in terms of offering a vaccine. It\u2019s a semantic debate. \n   \n  The original October deadline was set when the best advice was that AstraZeneca doses should be given four weeks apart, but the advice changed that a 12-week gap makes it most effective. \n  Caroline Edwards, from the health department, said the government is still aiming to vaccinate everyone by the end of October. \n  She said: \n   \n   We are still planning and hoping to have both shots by the end of October. In the event that we didn\u2019t get all shots by the end of October, the second shot would be finished six weeks after the end of October. \n   \n  Which would put us in December. \n  \n \n \n  3.34am GMT  \n Australian health department does not have an \u2018exact date\u2019 for whole population being vaccinated \n  \n  The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has revealed he is notified of \u201cserious\u201d adverse events related to the vaccine, but it\u2019s so far so good. \n  He said: \n   \n   There have been a few cases of anaphylaxis. There have been some deaths following immunisation but not related to immunisation. \n   [But] nothing unusual. The majority have been those consistent with clinical trial and real world data ... We\u2019ve seen three cases of severe allergic reactions, but they were handled expertly and quickly, with no ongoing adverse effects. \n   \n  Other adverse events are relatively minor and include pain at the injection site, some fever, body pain, headache, Kelly said, but \u201cnothing untoward\u201d. \n  Brendan Murphy said the first major \u201cclinical milestone\u201d will be when phases 1A and 1B are complete, when all \u201cvulnerable Australians\u201d are vaccinated. But health department officials can\u2019t say when 4m Australians will be vaccinated, after Murphy signalled it will miss the original end-of-March timeline \n  Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher asks whether the October timeline means everyone will have had one or both of the AstraZeneca doses \u2013 which are ideally spaced 12 weeks apart \u2013 by that date. \n  Murphy said the October timeline is to have delivered the first dose, which is already \u201cvery effective\u201d by itself. \n  As Gallagher notes, this contradicts the department of prime minister and cabinet secretary Phil Gaetjens\u2019 evidence that the target relates to people having both doses. Murphy said this will be difficult. \n  Murphy said: \n   \n   We haven\u2019t got an exact date. We\u2019re remodelling. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.21am GMT  \n Taiwan in travel bubble talks \n  \n  Taiwan officials have revealed they have been in talks since last year with several countries about the possibility of forming travel bubbles. It didn\u2019t make clear whether all the discussions were still going, given some of the countries had seen recent resurgences of Covid cases.According to Taiwan media, Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin Chia-lung told colleagues on Wednesday the government is in discussions with Vietnam (current seven-day case average: seven) Japan (1,065) seven), Japan (1,065), Korea (417), Singapore (14) and Palau(no cases ever).  \n  Both Japan and Korea\u2019s rates are declining after a big spike in December.A bubble with Palau - A Covid-free pacific island nation and one of the few governments in the world which recognises Taiwan as a country- is the furthest along. According to reports travel could begin as soon as April, with eight flights per week carrying 200 passengers each. Tourism agencies have said tours would cost around $40,000NT per person (about US $1,400) per person, for a four-day trip - an increase on normal prices of about 166%, and not factoring in the cost of insurance and getting required Covid tests. \n  The next likeliest bubble is with Singapore. \u201cThe Singaporean government has the Covid-19 outbreak well under control and is most active in pursuing an opportunity to form a travel bubble with Taiwan,\u201d Lin said.Taiwan has kept the virus largely at bay, with just a few small local outbreaks which have been quickly brought under control. It\u2019s borders are closed to non-residents and some select visa holders (including business travellers), and requires strict hotel or home residence quarantine on arrival (two weeks for most people, just five days for business travellers). The government has remained extraordinarily cautious, and other attempts at travel bubbles elsewhere have been problematic, so people should perhaps not be planning holidays just yet.\u201cWe see the hope of resuming overseas travel one day, but we should not get our hopes too high as the COVID-19 situation remains serious in other countries,\u201d Lin said. \n  \n \n \n  2.57am GMT  \n  \n  Interim data from a late-stage study of their experimental Covid antibody therapy showed an 85% reduction in hospitalisation or death in patients, Vir Biotechnology Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc said on Thursday, Reuters reports. Following the data an independent panel has recommended stopping the trial, the two companies said, adding they were planning to submit an emergency use authorisation application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment. \n  \n \n \n  2.30am GMT  \n  \n  US nursing home residents vaccinated against Covid can get hugs again from their loved ones, and all residents may enjoy more indoor visits, the government said Wednesday in a step toward pre-pandemic normalcy.AP: The policy guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, comes as coronavirus cases and deaths among nursing home residents have plummeted in recent weeks at the same time that vaccination accelerated. People living in long-term care facilities have borne a cruel toll from the pandemic. They represent about 1% of the US population, but account for 1 in 3 deaths, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Government officials acknowledged that isolation deepened the misery for residents as long-term care facilities remained locked down much of last year. Loneliness contributed to physical as well as mental decline. The ban on visits went into effect almost one year ago and only in the fall were facilities allowed to begin socially distanced outdoor visits and limited indoor ones.\u201cThere is no substitute for physical contact, such as the warm embrace between a resident and their loved one,\u201d CMS said in its new guidance, \u201cTherefore, if the resident is fully vaccinated, they can choose to have close contact (including touch) with their visitor while wearing a well-fitting face mask and performing hand-hygiene before and after.\u201dSo while hugs are OK again for residents who have completed their vaccination, precautions such as wearing masks and using hand sanitiser remain in place as a counterbalance to risk. CMS also underscored that maintaining 6 feet of separation is still the safest policy, and outdoor visits are preferable even when residents and visitors have been vaccinated. \n  \n \n \n  1.55am GMT  \n  \n  Over half of the public believes the coronavirus outbreak has driven greater social inequality in the UK over the past few months, according to a study by the government\u2019s independent advisers. \n  The Social Mobility Commission said its annual survey of public attitudes revealed 56% of adults believed social inequality had increased during the pandemic.

The global nurse shortage could widen to nearly 13 million, it added. \n  \u201cWe could be on a precipice,\u201d said Catton, recalling that it took three to four years of training to produce a novice nurse. \n  He said nurses had done a \u201cphenomenal\u201d job \u201cto lead the world through this pandemic\u201d, saying they would share an equal platform with the vaccine creators in the eventual history of Covid-19. \n  But once the pandemic has passed, frazzled nurses will then have to deal with all the unmet healthcare needs and waiting lists, whilst also facing likely staff shortages. \n  Founded in 1899, the ICN is a federation of more than 130 national nursing associations. \n  It called for governments to invest in training more new nurses to address the global shortage. \n  It also called for better pay to encourage existing staff to stay on - to bolster health systems for future crises, if nothing else. \n  \n \n \n  11.57pm GMT  \n 3,000 nurses dead, Covid exodus looming: global federation \n  \n  At least 3,000 nurses have been killed by Covid-19, the global nurses\u2019 federation said Thursday as it warned of a looming exodus of health workers traumatised by the pandemic, AFP reports.  \n  Exactly one year on since the World Health Organization (WHO) first described Covid-19 as a pandemic, the International Council of Nurses said burn-out and stress had led millions of nurses to consider quitting the profession. \n  And once the pandemic is over, a dwindling number of experienced nurses could be left to handle the giant backlog of regular hospital care that had been postponed due to the crisis, the ICN warned. \n  The known death toll of nurses killed by the disease - compiled from just 60 countries - is likely to be a gross underestimate of the full total, the federation said. \n  ICN chief executive Howard Catton said nurses had gone through \u201cmass traumatisation\u201d during the pandemic, being pushed to physical and mental exhaustion. \n  \u201cThey reach a point where they\u2019ve given everything they can,\u201d he told reporters. \n  Catton said the global workforce of 27 million nurses was six million short going into the pandemic - and four million were heading for retirement by 2030. \n  \n \n \n  11.53pm GMT  \n Summary \n  \n  Hello and welcome to today\u2019s live coronavirus coverage, exactly one year since the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, on 11 March 2020 (I am writing from Australia, where it is Thursday, 11 March 2021).  \n  In that year, at least 3,000 nurses have been killed by the virus, the global nurses\u2019 federation said as it warned of a looming exodus of health workers traumatised by the pandemic. \n  We\u2019ll have more on that shortly. Meanwhile here are the other key recent developments:  \n   \n   The daily number of new coronavirus cases in Turkey rose on Wednesday to the highest level this year, standing at 14,556, health ministry data showed. \n   There is nothing to suggest so far that vaccination was responsible for the death and illness of two people who had been given AstraZeneca\u2019s Covid vaccine in Austria, the European Medicines Agency said. Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Latvia have along with Austria suspended using the vaccine to allow time for the EMA\u2019s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee to conduct an investigation. \n   France reported 30,303 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours on Wednesday, rising above 30,000 for the first time in two weeks. \n   The Maltese government has ordered non-essential shops and schools to close amid a surge in Covid-19 cases on the Mediterranean island. \n   The European commission said on Wednesday it has reached a deal with Pfizer and BioNTech for the supply of an additional 4m Covid vaccine doses to be delivered this month. \n   The highly infectious British variant of Covid-19 is between 30% and 100% more deadly than previous strains, researchers have said. \n   Poland has reported 17,260 new daily Covid cases, the highest number since November. \n   Mauritius has started a two-week nationwide lockdown following 14 local Covid cases, with all residents and visitors asked to stay at home or in their hotels until 25 March. \n   Far more people in Germany will receive a Covid vaccination from April when family doctors start giving them but the idea that 25% of the population can get a shot in just a month is unrealistic, its health minister warned on Wednesday. \n   Bulgaria has reported 3,502 new Covid cases, its highest daily tally in three months, as government data shows the number of deaths also increased to 132. \n   \n  \n", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "'He is our quarterback': David Culley says Texans are committed to Watson", "full_article": "New Houston Texans coach David Culley reiterated Thursday that the team has no intention of trading Deshaun Watson despite the star quarterback\u2019s request to be dealt. Culley, hired in January to replace Bill O\u2019Brien, was asked more than a half-dozen times about Watson\u2019s future with the team. Every time he made it clear he expects Watson to lead his team this season.   Related: The Bears are in a perfect position to end Russell Wilson's Seahawks career    \u201cWe are very committed to Deshaun as our quarterback,\u201d Culley said. \u201cHe is our quarterback. He\u2019s the only guy we got under contract at this time right now.\u201d Culley said he has spoken to Watson since taking that job but declined to give any details. Later he was asked whether he has tried to talk Watson into wanting to remain with the team. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of me trying to change anybody\u2019s mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAs I said before, right now we\u2019re committed to him. He\u2019s a Houston Texan and we\u2019re going to move forward with that.\u201d Watson, who led the NFL in yards passing last season, has been unhappy with the direction of the team for some time. He made his request to be traded not long after the season ended. Sports Illustrated reported in January that Watson was upset the Texans didn\u2019t initially request to interview Kansas City offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy for their coaching vacancy. They eventually did interview Bieniemy before hiring Culley. O\u2019Brien was fired after the Texans opened the season 0-4 and they finished 4-12 after winning the AFC South the previous two seasons. Culley said they do not have a contingency plan at quarterback if Watson decides to hold out if he isn\u2019t traded. Asked if Watson was committed to him and the team, Culley replied: \u201cYes, he is.\u201d When pushed about how he knows that, Culley didn\u2019t provide any details indicating Watson has told him that.

I feel like that with the commitment that we\u2019ve made to him, I feel like that that same commitment will be there with us.\u201d The situation with Watson comes amid a time of unprecedented upheaval for the franchise. The Texans granted JJ Watt\u2019s request to be released last month with one year remaining on his contract. He recently signed with the Cardinals for two years, joining star receiver DeAndre Hopkins \u2013 who O\u2019Brien traded before last season for very little return. Watson is in a different situation than Watt after signing a four-year, $156m contract last year. Watson\u2019s contract makes a trade more difficult because of the future dead money for Houston, which gave him a $27m bonus that is prorated. Culley is in his first head coaching job after spending more than two decades as an NFL assistant. He seems undaunted by the uncertainty surrounding Watson and is looking forward to getting going with his new team. \u201cMy enthusiasm has gone through the roof right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone up even more. If you saw me before then, you see me now and you hear me now, you see it\u2019s gone through the roof, and it\u2019s getting higher and higher every day as I get excited about this football team and where we\u2019re headed.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Manchester schools to launch study into children's wellbeing after Covid", "full_article": "An unprecedented study into the wellbeing of British children is to be conducted across Manchester\u2019s schools, as new research suggests two-thirds of parents believe it should be prioritised over academic attainment. The Greater Manchester young people\u2019s wellbeing programme will gather data from tens of thousands of young people across 250 secondary schools in the city in an attempt to change their perception as \u201cpeople who get GCSE results\u201d, according to the programme\u2019s creator. The first study of its kind in the country, the wellbeing programme will begin this autumn and will seek to ascertain young people\u2019s feelings and concerns as well as their levels of physical activity. The information gathered will be used to help better target resources as children try to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. Research is to be conducted by the University of Manchester in association with the Anna Freud Centre, the Youth Sports Trust and the Greater Manchester combined authority. It is an idea conceived by the philanthropist David Gregson, who argues that the UK has neglected the wellbeing and physical health of children in favour of academic attainment, to the detriment of their development. A new YouGov survey commissioned by the Youth Sports Trust suggested parents across the country would be sympathetic to such arguments. The survey found that 65% of parents believed wellbeing was a key factor in choosing a child\u2019s secondary school, while only 48% said the same of exam results. Meanwhile, 70% of parents with children between the ages of 11 and 16 said their children\u2019s wellbeing had suffered during the pandemic. \u201cI first took this idea to Greater Manchester in 2019 and all Covid has done, as the tide has gone out, is expose the pebbles we knew existed,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cFor me, our education system has become too focused on attainment. A necessary but insufficient assessment. \u201cWe\u2019ve got ourselves into the position where we think that attainment is the be-all and end-all and I don\u2019t agree with that. I want to change that dialogue and I want to improve the wellbeing of young people in Greater Manchester to prove that point.\u201d Gregson says information collated by the programme will quickly be shared with local authorities in order to recognise areas of need, specifically with regards to physical activity, which is proven to improve wellbeing. \u201cMy 10-year plan is to add a second leg to the assessment of young people in Britain that we don\u2019t just think of them as people who get GCSE results,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cThat we think about another equally important part of their makeup, which is their wellbeing, their sense of self-esteem, their sense of optimism.

See his house, maybe? Throw a frisbee really far? Get really good phone signal? He hasn\u2019t scored direct from a free kick since 2017, so it can\u2019t be that.\u201d       8.36pm GMT    GOAL! Olympiakos 0-1 Arsenal (Odegaard, 34)    Phwoar. Martin Odegaard almost breaks the net with a rocket from distance! Odegaard sends a venomous shot crashing towards goal and it catches out the Olympiakos goalkeeper, who was quite simply overpowered. Olympiakos got caught trying to play out of the back and then Odegaard drfited inside and took aim centrally.     Martin Odegaard fires the Gunners ahead. Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP      Updated at 8.45pm GMT     8.33pm GMT       31 min: Arsenal power up down the left flank through Tierney but Soktaris rakes the ball clear. If Arsenal are going to strike, it looks a sure bet that it will come down the left-hand side. A little earlier, Manchester United suffered a stoppage-time blow:   Related: Manchester United denied win against Milan by Simon Kj\u00e6r's late equaliser         8.31pm GMT       30 min: Arsenal seem to have got a bit sloppy. They\u2019re huffing and puffing. As for former Arsenal youngster Harry Kane, that\u2019s 25 goals for the season, so the England captain has now surpassed his goal tally from each of his previous two seasons (24 in 2019-20 and 2018-19).       8.27pm GMT    GOAL! Tottenham 1-0 Dinamo Zagreb (Kane, 25)    Advantage Spurs! Lamela\u2019s shot bounces back off a post and Kane is on hand \u2013 of course \u2013 to poke in the rebound. Meanwhile, elsewhere in the last 16, Roma and Granada both lead 1-0.     Harry Kane puts Spurs ahead. Photograph: Getty Images      Updated at 8.32pm GMT     8.26pm GMT       25 min: Now Bukayo Saka is fouled 25 yards from goal. It was a cheap foul and Arsenal earn another chance to test Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1 ...       8.25pm GMT       23 min: ... Aubameyang thumps at it at the goalkeeper but it is a comfortable save. There was plenty of oomph behind the free-kick but that was about it. Arsenal still very much on top.       8.24pm GMT       22 min: M\u2019Vila is booked for fouling Saka. It was a crude challenge and Arsenal win a free-kick 20 yards out ... It was Odegaard who gifted possession away a moment ago but he is now part of the committee who fancy a pop at this free-kick. Aubameyang fancies it too ...       8.22pm GMT       21 min: ... right on cue, Arsenal get sloppy and Bruma drills an effort at Leno! Arsenal are their own worst enemy, aren\u2019t they?       8.22pm GMT       21 min: There is a bit of a lull in the game in Piraeus. Olympiakos have just had a little spell of possession, though ...       8.20pm GMT       19 min: A gentle reminder that Arsenal host Tottenham at the Emirates on Sunday. Mikel Arteta insisted pre-match the full focus was on this one, though, given it looks to be their only route to the Champions League. \u201cEvery game for us is a final in any competition we play,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cThis competition is very relevant because it gives us the chance to win a trophy and qualify for the Champions League.\u201d        8.19pm GMT       17 min: ... David Luiz stings the palms of goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1.       8.18pm GMT       16 min: It is La La Land for Tierney, who is bombing forward down the left at will against Olympiakios full-back Kenny Lala. The defender is having a tricky evening and has just upended Willian 25 yards from goal. Willian, David Luiz and Martin Odegaard are stood over it ...       8.15pm GMT       13 min: Olympiakos look unnervingly comfortable to invite Arsenal pressure. Tierney is having a load of fun down the left flank and has just whipped another teasing cross towards the front post but Saka cannot get there.       8.12pm GMT       11 min: Tottenham are not looking quite so coherent at home to Dinamo Zagreb. Gareth Bale is among the substitutes tonight, but Harry Kane and Son Heung-min both start for Spurs.       8.11pm GMT       10 min: It is still all Arsenal in Greece. Dominating the ball is probably underselling quite how one-sided this game has been. A little earlier, Rangers nabbed an away goal in Prague:   Related: Filip Helander's away goal heartens Rangers after slow start at Slavia Prague         8.09pm GMT       8 min: Olympiakos have been made to look oh so ordinary so far. A reminder that there is a familiar face in the Greek side\u2019s back line: Sokratis. The former Sunderland midfielder Yan M\u2019Vila, too.    Updated at 8.10pm GMT     8.08pm GMT       6 min: Aubameyang heads against the bar! Beller\u00edn hangs a delightful cross towards the six-yard box, the Arsenal skipper nips in front of his marker to meet it and his effort deflects via the defender and the goalkeeper\u2019s outstretched left arm and against the woodwork. Mikel Arteta will be chuffed with this start. They could do with something to show for it, though.     Aubameyang comes close to opening the scoring. Photograph: Alkis Konstantinidis/Reuters      Updated at 8.12pm GMT     8.06pm GMT       5 min: Arsenal are on the front foot, all very encouraging. As for Manchester United, that Milan equaliser is a kick in the teeth. When failing to win the first leg at home, United have been eliminated from six of their last eight ties in European competition, most recently against Barcelona in the 2018-19 Champions League. Hmmm ...       8.04pm GMT       2 min: Tierney pulls the ball back to Odegaard, just inside the Olympiakos box ... but the Norwegian drags it wide. It fizzed in off the left on a damp pitch but Odegaard, whose shot was tame, got his angles wrong.       8.03pm GMT       1 min: Olympiakos were forced into a pre-match reshuffle. Ousseynou Ba felt a niggle in the warm so the former Sunderland midfielder M\u2019Vila drops back into defence. Masouras starts in Ba\u2019s place.       8.01pm GMT    Peeeeeeeeeeeep!

Outstanding reflexes and a good strong hand.    Updated at 7.44pm GMT     7.43pm GMT       89 min: Milan are going full-gun for the equaliser, forcing United to defend in extremis in their own area. Leao has a chance to test Henderson when the ball squirts out to him 10 yards from goal .... but the striker does an air-shot, and United exhale!        7.37pm GMT       85 min: McTominay clonks into Krunic just outside the D. He\u2019s already on a yellow and is lucky to avoid a dismissal for a blatant foul. Maybe Milan will mete out punishment from the freekick? Nope, Krunic bashes it straight into the wall.       7.35pm GMT    GOAL! Ajax 2-0 Young Boys (Tadic 82)    The former Southampton man puts Ajax in charge against Young Boys.       7.33pm GMT       78 min: A score draw in Prague would be a decent result but they are not settling for that: they\u2019re pushing for the win and making life very uncomfortable for the hosts. They\u2019re certainly giving the Czech champions a tougher game than Leicester did.       7.27pm GMT       74 min: United substitutions: Fred, Shaw and Williams on, Fernandes, James and Wan-Bissaka off.    Updated at 7.34pm GMT     7.25pm GMT       70 min: Rangers are coming on strong in Prague. \u201cHope you\u2019re well. Even though I\u2019m not a Manchester United fan, a Swansea fan, or even a Wales fan, I will never not love Daniel James after seeing that video of his partner surprising him with a puppy a couple years ago,\u201d simpers Adam Kline-Schoder. It\u2019s possible that my previous sentence was a slight exaggeration, but it is no exaggeration to say that I\u2019m happy he is finding his way. I loved watching him at Swansea, charging beyond defenders with such grace and confidence. It was sad to see him going so firmly off the boil after a storming start to his time in Manchester, and I\u2019m glad to see him terrorising defences yet again. Enjoy the match.\u201d And here\u2019s the video that got Adam all misty-eyed.      Slavia Prague\u2019s Lukas Provod tackles Ryan Kent.

He was trying to do exactly that just now when Sima clobbered him from behind on half-way, earning a deserved yellow card.       7.08pm GMT       55 min: Davis gets a rather harsh booking for going into a 50/50 tackle in midfield.        7.07pm GMT    GOAL! Dynamo Kyiv 0-2 Villarreal (Albiol 52)    The Spanish side are two goals to the good after Albiol smacks in a rebound from close range.       7.06pm GMT    GOAL! United 1-0 Milan (Diallo 50)    Oh wow! What an artful finish from the 18-year-old! Fernandes dropped a dainty pass over the head of the last defender and Diallo, having made clever run, turns to face it and then flips a superb back-header over the advancing keeper and into the net! Such deftness! Such awareness! Such an impressive way for a teenager to open his account for United!     Amad Diallo nods the opening goal for the Red Devils. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters      Updated at 7.08pm GMT     7.01pm GMT       47 min: United are no Wolves but ponderous first halves followed by vibrant second halves have been a bit of a trend this season. It looks like continuing her if the first two minutes of the second period are anything to go by. They\u2019ve been goodly perky.       6.59pm GMT       \u201cHow did you not link the Guardian\u2019s own Dundee Utd insult in Nigeria article into Simon McMahon\u2019s post?\u201d howls Gaz Boardman, doing my job for me.

No way he was ever going to get a penalty for that.        6.36pm GMT    GOAL! Slavia 1-1 Rangers (Helander 36)    Rangers have an away goal! Slavia didn\u2019t deal with a frekick into the box, allowing the ball to ricochet off a defender and trundle towards the byline. Hagi chased it and pulled it back cleverly, and Helander reacted faster than anyone to prod into the net from close range!      Filip Helander grabs an equalizer for \u2018Gers. Photograph: Kirk O\u2019Rourke/Rangers FC/REX/Shutterstock      Updated at 6.54pm GMT     6.35pm GMT       38 min: What? How? Where are we?! Maguire has just perpetrated an extraordinary miss! A United corner came in, Fernandes flicked it on at the near post and Maguire arrived at the back to tap it into the net from a yard ... but instead he shinned it against the post and it looped back over him and out at an improbable angle! Even Maguire looks bewildered!     Harry Maguire manages to miss a sitter. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA      Updated at 6.39pm GMT     6.33pm GMT       36 min: Fernandes wins a foul a couple of yards outside the D. He\u2019ll probably take the freekick himself, though Telles wants a piece of the action. And it\u2019s Telles who takes it ... but he\u2019ll not be on the next one, after banging his shot into one of the United players who was supposed to be acting as a decoy in front of the wall.       6.29pm GMT       34 min: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Manchester United\u2019s appointment of John Murtough as director of football has had absolutely no effect so far: There is no direction to their football tonight,\u201d bellows Justin Kavanagh. \u201cA creative deep midfielder might help.\u201d        6.28pm GMT    GOAL! Dynamo Kyiv 0-1 Villarreal (Tores 30)    It\u2019s been six years sicne Kyiv made it beyond this stage of the tournament and they\u2019re going to have to come from behind to do it this year.       6.27pm GMT       29 min: Barisic is booked for taking down Kuchta on the edge of the Rangers\u2019 box, to the right. A chance for Slavia to put the freekick into the box, and they\u2019re physically significantly bigger than Rangers, as well as being well organised and technically adept. Provod tries to catch mcGregor off guard by going for goal despite the acute angle. The keeper\u2019s wise to it and pushes it around the post for a corner. \u201cWhat was Matt Drake thinking ordering the pizza at Slavia?\u201d carps Rory Davies. \u201cAs a former season ticket holder at the old Slavia ground, it was always half a chicken on a small cardboard square with two slices of dark bread and a pickle. During the colder months when extra calories were needed, they would happily dip your two slices in the trough of molten chicken fat under the rotisserie. All washed down with pints of Gambrinus brought to your seat.\u201d        6.23pm GMT       25 min: Hagi is chopped down midway inside the Slavia half, giving Rangers a chance to stick a freekick into the area. In fact, Slavia set the defensive line just outside the D, so Davis clips the ball over the top .... and Slavia intercept, heading it clear. Slavia hurtle down the other end and threaten to nick a second, but Helander does enough to put off Kuchta.        6.18pm GMT       24 min: Dalot fluffs a cross, but he got up into a very attacking position, a reflection of Milan\u2019s confidence. They\u2019ve been both compact and vibrant so far. United look sluggish. \u201cWatching the Belgian coverage of the game (with Dutch commentary) and it seems even us Belgians, or definitely our commentators, have gotten wind of the circus that VAR has been in England,\u201d says Toon Helsen. \u201cHe reacted exasperatedly, indignantly, at the goal check saying \u201cwhat? Was there not enough air in the ball maybe? Or did Kessie score on an odd second and thus it\u2019s not allowed??\u201d. As a United fan I am more than pleased about VAR being on our side once again of course but it seems my countrymen are catching on VAR and its rigorous application (or lack thereof, depending on where one\u2019s loyalties lie).\u201d        6.14pm GMT       18 min: A foul on Telles gives United a freekick in a useful crossing position. Everyone piles into the box. Telles goes for a goal ... or maybe it was just a terrible cross - whatever, the ball curls a few years over the bar.        6.12pm GMT       16 min: Milan are comfortably the better team at Old Trafford so far. United haven\u2019t offered anything by way of attack yet. \u201cIn terms of stadium food, not even my son will eat the hot dogs at the Emirates and he is usually as discerning as an urban fox,\u201d writes Simon Thomas. \u201cThe Balti pie at Villa is wonderful though. As is that odd square sausage thing they sell at Ibrox.\u2019 It\u2019s good nostalgia, isn\u2019t it, reminiscing about the days, a year ago now, when people could watch matches in stadiums.       6.08pm GMT    NO GOAL! Not United 0-1 Milan (Not Kessi\u00e9 11)    What a strike! Kessi\u00e9, just inside the United area, is allowed to let the ball bounce from a throw-in and turn and then smash the hopping ball into the net from 16 yards while three United players just watched him! But it\u2019s ruled out after a VAR check, which judged that he controlled the ball with a hand before unloading his shot. That\u2019s two disallowed goals for Milan. United can\u2019t say they haven\u2019t been warned.        6.05pm GMT       Not wishing to riff on any Scots\u2019 pain or anything, but mcGregor\u2019s reaction to Stancu\u2019s shot just now evoked memories of Alan Rough v Zico ...                    6.03pm GMT    GOAL! Slavia Prague 1-0 Rangers (Stancu 7)    The home side take the lead with a sumptuous goal from distance. Slavia worked the ball cleverly to Stancu at the left-hand corner of the Rangers box, and the Romanian took a touch to tee himself up and then swept a beautiful curler into the far corner of the net! McGregor didn\u2019t budge.     Nicolae Stanciu fires in the first goal of the evening. Photograph: Kirk O\u2019Rourke/Rangers FC/REX/Shutterstock      Updated at 6.22pm GMT     6.01pm GMT       5 min: Very sedate openings in Manchester and Prague, where the sides seem to be just sizing each other up. At least that was the case until a moment ago, when Leal thrashed a shot into the net to five Milan the lead! But it was disallowed because the reason he had got the run on Bailly was because he was in an offside position when the ball was dropped over to the top for him to chase. Still, it was a smart finish and a warning to United. \u201cI\u2019m American and went to the Roma-Chievo Verona match at the Stadio Olimpico in May 2016 (featuring Mo Salah, Lucas Digne, Antonio Rudiger, and Francesco Totti\u2019s 600th Serie A appearance),\u201d reveals Matt Burtz. \u201cI was quite surprised to learn that apparently you can openly smoke cigarettes at a stadium in Italy, something you would never see in the US, even in an outdoor facility.

As the minutes ticked down this began to feel like another addition, perhaps the most critical one, to the case that Arsenal are not quite ready to succeed with the playing style Mikel Arteta desires. They had been superior to Olympiakos in every department bar the part of one\u2019s brain that dictates when, and how, to weave intricate passing moves from the back. When Youssef El-Arabi finally punished them with an equaliser shortly before the hour, raising the spectre of last season\u2019s second-leg heist, there was an obvious danger they had been too clever for their own good. \n \n  Related: Manchester United denied win against Milan by Simon Kj\u00e6r's late equaliser  \n \nEvery Europa League tie carries a profound sense of jeopardy for Arsenal given their domestic toils. They eventually pulled clear in this one and earned the convincing win that, repeat offences to one side, their fluent performance merited. This is a better team than the one that nosedived against the same opponents in February 2020: here they could prove it via a bravura header from Gabriel and a long-range blast from the substitute Mohamed Elneny. It should be enough to avert disaster at the Emirates next Thursday. \n\u201cI\u2019m really pleased with the result, with the goals we scored and the way we played in big moments,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cBut as well we have to be very honest with ourselves that we gave three [chances] to our opponents and they scored one. To go to the next level we have to be more ruthless and kill games.\u201d \nArsenal had deservedly led through a 34th-minute thunderbolt by Martin \u00d8degaard, who had missed a presentable early chance but put his left foot through the ball from 25 yards and sent a ripping strike past Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1. It flew straight down the middle but the home keeper was beaten by the sheer force. There was little doubt the visitors had more goals in them: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang had already been thwarted when S\u00e1 brilliantly pawed his deflected header on to the bar and Olympiakos looked ragged under examination. \n \n  \n  \n  Martin \u00d8degaard (right) opens the scoring for Arsenal. \n  Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP \n  \n \nOn Saturday, Burnley had not looked much sturdier before Granit Xhaka handed them parity on a plate. Arteta wants Arsenal to play out from defence but, as he accepted in what was at times a carbon copy of the weekend\u2019s post-match inquest, they are yet to perfect their decision making. No pennies had dropped between the two games: a loose pass from \u00d8degaard before his opener saw Bruma squander Olympiakos\u2019s first opportunity with a tame shot at Bernd Leno. As half-time neared, David Luiz presented the ball to Giorgos Masouras deep inside Arsenal\u2019s area and was fortunate to see the winger balloon horribly wide. \n \n  Related: Harry Kane doubles up to sink Dinamo Zagreb and put Spurs in driving seat  \n \nIf it is careless to err twice, how does one describe the third time? Dani Ceballos had just replaced the excellent Thomas Partey when he received a short pass from Leno, who had clear options to his right but played him horribly into trouble. An alert El-Arabi pickpocketed him and, with Leno backtracking fruitlessly, curled the ball into the bottom corner from 20 yards. \nEl-Arabi, who jabbed in the dramatic late winner last time around, would have compounded matters if H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn had not bravely deflected another shot just wide. Arsenal took charge again, though, and the quality of their goals was unimpeachable. Gabriel bullied the stand-in centre-back Yann M\u2019Vila when Willian hung in a deep cross and, via a tremendous run and leap, arced in an unstoppable finish. Then Elneny, who had recently come on, took aim from distance as space opened up in midfield and found the corner via S\u00e1\u2019s left hand. \u201cHe\u2019s been training so hard to improve his shooting range,\u201d Arteta said. \n \n  \n \n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n  \n \nPerhaps it is all part of the equation: maybe Arsenal will reach the point where conceding maddening goals becomes irrelevant as the bulk of quality at the other end holds sway. But that looks some way off and Arteta agreed people could fairly say Arsenal are their own worst enemy. \u201cThey\u2019re not far off,\u201d he said. \u201cThe goals and chances we have conceded are coming from ourselves. The reality is we have to stop it immediately.\u201d They will probably get away with it in a week\u2019s time, but their season depends on it.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Harry Kane doubles up to sink Dinamo Zagreb and put Spurs in driving seat", "full_article": "On the day that Daniel Levy celebrated his 20th anniversary as the Tottenham chairman, it was perhaps inevitable that the lack of silverware on his watch would be highlighted. The return amounts to a single League Cup. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho considers trophies as the \u201csalt and pepper of football,\u201d the essential seasoning, and so has Levy\u2019s reign been bland? Hardly. Yet how everybody connected to the club craves something this season, very possibly in the Europa League.   Related: Manchester United denied win against Milan by Simon Kj\u00e6r's late equaliser    Against the 21-times champions of Croatia, Spurs took another step towards the dream. It has been a gruelling campaign and this was game No 45 for Mourinho and his players but they proved too strong for Dinamo Zagreb, moving to within touching distance of the quarter-finals. Harry Kane was pictured with an ice pack on his knee after his 84th-minute substitution but it was merely precautionary. He will surely be fit for Sunday\u2019s derby at Arsenal, according to Mourinho. Kane could reflect, instead, on a decisive two-goal contribution that drove a fifth win on the spin in all competitions for his team and prompted the Dinamo manager, Zoran Mamic, to salute him as a \u201cmaster of football.\u201d \u201cHarry is that because he is very intelligent,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cHe scores goals but, as well as that, he understands every tip we give him in terms of his positioning and movement.

It was the first serious test of Spurs\u2019s credentials in this competition, even if it felt strange that it had taken them 12 ties to reach it. Dinamo, who dropped down from the Champions League qualifying rounds last September, brought form in the shape of eight straight wins in all competitions and their technique and intensity was on show at the outset. The evening could conceivably have followed a different course had Mislav Orsic, the Dinamo danger man, shot more cleanly after being inadvertently set through by Tanguy Ndombele\u2019s loose back pass inside the first minute. Davinson S\u00e1nchez gave chase but Orsic had a good look at Hugo Lloris\u2019s goal. The finish was weak.   Related: Filip Helander\u2019s away goal heartens Rangers after slow start at Slavia Prague    Spurs stabilised after a sloppy start, with Erik Lamela central to asserting them as a physical force. It was not an evening when they could simply weave their patterns; Dinamo were too aggressive for that. Lamela fought fire with fire; putting his foot in, hustling. There was also skill and directness from him. He had almost teed up Kane with a ball over the top and he set up the breakthrough goal. Lamela was too strong for Lovro Majer in a 50-50 challenge and, when he spun away with the ball, his only thought was to run at the edge of the area. He swerved from left to right, moving away from Rasmus Lauritsen and throwing Kevin Theophile-Catherine before flicking a shot with the outside of his boot that came back off the inside of the post. Kane was on hand to roll the rebound into the empty net.     Harry Kane celebrates after opening the scoring for Tottenham against Dinamo Zagreb. Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP    Spurs worked a few promising openings before the interval, leading to crosses from Serge Aurier and Ben Davies only for nothing to come of them, but they were on top, with Dinamo forced back into their defensive block. The visitors\u2019 plan was to punch on the counter; Spurs dealt with their threat with a degree of comfort.   Related: \u00d8degaard and Elneny set up Arsenal\u2019s Europa League victory at Olympiakos    There was controversy early in the second half when Ndombele threw a stepover inside the area to panic Majer, who lunged at him. The Dinamo midfielder jammed his boot against Ndombele\u2019s ankle, with no contact on the ball, before rather bundling into him. When Ndombele went down, it looked like a penalty. To Mourinho\u2019s fury, the referee, Serdar Gozubuyuk, and his video assistant saw it differently. Spurs advertised a second goal, with Kane volleying a Son Heung-min cross towards Dele Alli only for Dinamo to clear and they got it when Theophile-Catherine miskicked an Aurier cross to Kane. Bad idea. Kane took one touch to kill the ball, another to roll it right to nick the space from Theophile-Catherine and a final one to ram home a low finish. Gareth Bale, on as a sub, almost got on to a cross from another replacement, Steven Bergwijn, while Carlos Vin\u00edcius, who replaced Kane, shot straight at the goalkeeper, Dominik Livakovic. \u201cA third goal would have fitted the reality of the game very well,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cBut as it is, we did not kill the tie so it\u2019s still open.", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Max Malins handed a belated chance to shine for England in Six Nations", "full_article": "Picking England\u2019s rugby team is never an exact science and, latterly, Eddie Jones\u2019s alchemist\u2019s touch has deserted him. Too often he has either opted to stick with out-of-form regulars for slightly too long or not picked younger players when the opportunity has arisen. Giving a start to Max Malins at full-back should have happened at least a month ago, if not longer. With the championship already beyond their grasp it could be argued a lack of selectorial nettle-grasping, as much as anything, has been at the root of England\u2019s winter problems. Nothing against Elliot Daly, who has enjoyed some great moments with both England and the British &amp; Irish Lions, but why Malins did not wear the 15 jersey against Italy last month remains one of life\u2019s minor mysteries.   Related: Max Malins makes first start for England in Six Nations clash with France    At least now, belatedly, there are signs of the spring clean that England\u2019s starting XV has been needing for a while. Assuming, that is, that the 24-year-old Malins is given more chance to establish himself than was granted to Worcester\u2019s Ollie Lawrence, unceremoniously dropped after barely touching the ball against Scotland and only now back involved among the replacements. Based on the form he has shown on loan at Bristol this season and the glimpses of potential off the bench, English supporters should be genuinely excited about the \u201cMax factor\u201d that could conceivably lend some gloss to the home backline against France. For some reason Jones took against Alex Goode when the latter was playing as well as any other full-back in the country; now he has a younger model with a similar vision for the game who has already been compared by Saracens\u2019 director of rugby in stylistic terms to Beauden Barrett. Given Malins has grown up in the Sarries system he is also familiar with the importance of a decent kicking game and his national skipper Owen Farrell has seen enough to suspect the younger man has what it takes to prosper at the highest level: \u201cMax is a dangerous full-back. He makes things happen, he beats people. He\u2019s quick and strong and he\u2019s also got a great instinct about the game which is a brilliant quality to have.\u201d The only snag, as Northampton\u2019s George Furbank can testify, is that making an instant impact at full-back against this fast-improving French side remains easier said than done. England did show a touch more attacking rhythm against Wales in Cardiff but so far in this tournament their pack has found it difficult to establish a consistent platform. Jamie George and Jonny Hill have paid the price on this occasion, with Luke Cowan-Dickie and Charlie Ewels promoted to add front-row energy and lineout savvy respectively. Cowan-Dickie is about to win his 30th cap for England but will be making just his fifth start; try persuading the Exeter hooker there is not much difference between wearing the No 2 or No 16 jerseys. A big day also looms for Ewels\u2019s Bath teammate AnthonyWatson who has overcome more than his fair share of dark injury days to reach his 50th cap. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a player work so hard,\u201d noted Jones approvingly. \u201cI think his 50th game will be his best game.\u201d     The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.

A 6:2 bench split would suggest a desire to prevent a physical drop-off in the final quarter and memories of their unfortunate extra-time defeat in December\u2019s Autumn Nations Cup final have not yet entirely faded.

In an effort to improve his side\u2019s ability to think on their feet and avoid the red mist against Les Bleus, Jones has been putting his players under the pump by rehearsing a number of \u201cunfair\u201d match scenarios \u2013 including bad calls from officials \u2013 in training. Jones, who has handed a first Test start to Max Malins with Elliot Daly dropping to the bench, has sought to address England\u2019s high penalty count by bringing the referees Wayne Barnes and Matt Carley into training this week as he looks to avoid a third defeat in four Six Nations matches. On Thursday Jones also revealed how he has been stress-testing his players in a move that echoes Sir Clive Woodward\u2019s \u201cT-Cup\u201d mantra of Thinking Correctly Under Pressure.   Related: Max Malins makes first start for England in Six Nations clash with France    England came unstuck against Wales last time out by conceding penalties in costly clusters, on top of two controversial tries, which the referee Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re has since admitted he should have disallowed. For the first of those, Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re instructed Owen Farrell to address his teammates about their penalty count, only for Dan Biggar to kick a penalty across the field for Josh Adams to score. Farrell was incensed but Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re gave his protestations short shrift and the England captain was unable to improve his side\u2019s discipline thereafter. Jones has admitted his players had been \u201ctrying too hard\u201d when giving away needless penalties and wants them to improve on how they deal with their disappointment during the match. Citing France\u2019s knack of forcing their opponents to infringe, Jones said: \u201cWe have tried to create training sessions this week particularly to replicate what might be termed as a disappointment in the game to make sure that we don\u2019t lose our focus. Because what happens when you are not at your best is when you get those disappointing moments in the game, all other ideas start flooding into your head instead of just getting back to what is really important. \u201cSo particularly this week we have tried to create sessions that have elicited that response and again just tried to expose the players so they can practise that a bit more. [It is] game scenarios \u2026 a bad call by the referee, unfair conditions in the game \u2026 we have concentrated on a number of areas to put the players under pressure.

Farrell\u2019s leadership has come under increased scrutiny throughout the tournament and his reaction to Wales\u2019s first try only added to the suspicion his communication with referees needs improvement. Accordingly, Farrell has been picking the brains of Carley this week. \u201cI spoke to Matt for a bit about it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there\u2019s not too much you can do by way of getting that reversed. You never really change a referee\u2019s decision. You try to have a dialogue to understand things and see how you can do things better, but we\u2019re not really a part of the decision.

When Ryan reveals that after having a brain tumour, he can see \u201cthe joy in anything\u201d, Katie insists that it\u2019s true. \u201cYou\u2019ve never heard anyone wax so lyrical about a custard cream,\u201d she says. Never mind the biscuit: when he meets Kevin, a tiny french bulldog abandoned by his unscrupulous breeder at six weeks old, deemed too fragile to survive without expensive veterinary care, Ryan\u2019s delight is so great that you can practically feel it radiating off the screen. The programme\u2019s strengths lie in its compassionate eye for a human story, and how it carefully pairs that with a canine one. The adopters have to meet the dogs in a neutral environment before they are allowed to take them home, and it\u2019s all observed on camera by the staff, who comment on how it\u2019s going with the enthusiasm of a particularly eager sporting commentator. It sweeps you up in the drama. Rocky is massive and it looks as if he is too intimidating for Danny to even approach, but when they finally cross that barrier, and start to look like the perfect pair, it\u2019s as if your favourite team have just scored in the 89th minute. The show also encourages responsible decision-making, without being bossy, and in the current climate of puppy-mania, this seems particularly apt. The staff explain that while they are grateful that people want to rescue dogs, it is crucial that they are there to listen to what the dog needs. It is a big responsibility to ensure that they find a person or people to suit the dog, as much as the other way around. And, while \u201cadopt, don\u2019t shop\u201d is a strong slogan, rescue centres have struggled to meet demand during the pandemic. Clearly people are buying puppies, and it is worth shouting louder about the dangers and cruelties of puppy farms, too. Neither does it find the obvious happy ending every time. The formidable Maggie arrives at Wood Green with her two grandchildren, and discusses a long list of potential no-nos that would exclude a large amount of potential matches. She doesn\u2019t want a dog that\u2019s too old, nor one too young; she doesn\u2019t want one that\u2019s too big or too small, and she isn\u2019t keen on flat-nosed breeds. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d ask the staff, but she isn\u2019t quite sure. She meets Leo, \u201ca laid-back gentleman\u201d whose owner has died, and who takes to Maggie\u2019s lap with ease. But ultimately, she recognises that at 11, he is too old for her. She takes the time to find the perfect match, and does so off-camera, settling for a beautiful lurcher who loves to curl up in an armchair. \u201cDogs bring out the best in people,\u201d says one member of staff.

But it can nevertheless point to a lot of personal information about an individual. That could include health or financial information, revealed because a browser visits a certain site or category of site frequently. \nThe Open Rights Group, a digital campaign group, complained that details about the Home Office trial were insufficient. \n\u201cThis is a fairly staggering lack of transparency around mass data collection and retention,\u201d said policy manager Heather Burns. \n\u201cWe should have the right to not have every single click of what we do online hoovered up into a surveillance net on the assumption that there might be criminal activity taking place,\u201d she added. \nHome Office sources indicated that it was taking advantage of abilities in the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, to test what data can be acquired, how useful it is in practice, and how it might be used in investigations. \nThe act was described as giving the UK government \u201cthe most extreme surveillance in the history of western democracy\u201d by whistleblower Edward Snowden when it passed into law nearly five years ago. \nIt aimed to legalise a range of tools for snooping and hacking by the security services unmatched at the time by any other country in western Europe or even the US, following Snowden\u2019s revelations which showed the amount of mass surveillance that UK and US intelligence agencies already undertook. \nThe first trial began in July 2019 after the Home Office \u201cretention notice\u201d request was approved by the Investigatory Powers Commissioner\u2019s Office (Ipco) and related to an unnamed internet provider.

Egregious discrimination is widely thought to occur. For example, in 2017 Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak found that when he applied for an Apple Card he was offered borrowing 10 times that of his wife although they shared various bank accounts and other credit cards. Apple\u2019s partner for the card, Goldman Sachs, denied they made decisions based on gender.\n    \n    Policing\n    \n    Software is used to allocate policing resources on the ground and to predict how likely an individual is to commit or be a victim of a crime. Last year, a Liberty study found at least 14 UK police forces have plans to use crime prediction software. Such software is criticised for creating self-fulfilling crime patterns, ie sending officers to areas where crimes have occurred before, and the discriminatory profiling of ethnic minorities and low-income communities.\n    \n    Social work\n    \n    Local councils used \"predictive analytics\" to highlight particular families for the attention of child services. A 2018 Guardian investigation found that Hackney, Thurrock, Newham, Bristol and Brent councils were developing predictive systems either internally or by hiring private software companies. Critics warn that, aside from concerns about the vast amounts of sensitive data they contain, these systems incorporate the biases of their designers and risk perpetuating stereotypes.\n    \n    Job applications\n    \n    Automated systems are increasingly used by recruiters to whittle down pools of jobseekers, invigilate online tests and even interview candidates. Software scans CVs for keywords and generates a score for each applicant. Higher-scoring candidates may be asked to perform online personality and skills tests, and ultimately the first round of interviews may be carried out by bots which that use software to analyse facial features, word choices and vocal indicators to decide whether a candidate advances. Each of these stages is based on dubious science and may discriminate against certain traits or communities. Such systems learn bias and tend to favour the already advantaged.\n    \n    Offending\n    \n    Algorithms that access a criminal\u2019s chances of reoffending are widely used in the US. A ProRepublica investigation of the Compas recidivism software found that black defendants were often predicted to be at a higher risk of reoffending than they actually were and white defendants were often predicted to be less risky than they were.

The prime minister\u2019s spokesperson said on Thursday that ministers hoped to do so by the end of the year. \nThe home secretary, Priti Patel, responding to the many women who have shared personal experiences in the wake of Everard\u2019s disappearance, said she could relate to their stories. \nThe home secretary said: \u201cThese are so powerful because each and every woman can relate. Every woman should feel safe to walk on our streets without fear of harassment or violence.\u201d \nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, speaking at a campaign event, underlined the scale of the problem \u2013 and urged men to call out abusive behaviour. \n\u201cIf we are to really confront this the first thing we need to do is to recognise the scale of violence against women and girls. And I\u2019m not sure everybody appreciates just how prevalent and pervasive it is,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe all need to tackle this at root; we all need to recognise the issue and challenge behaviours,\u201d Starmer added. \u201cI think there\u2019s a particular issue for men. It\u2019s very important for men to speak out on this issue.\u201d \nA recent survey by UN Women UK found that 97% of women aged 18-24 had been sexually harassed, while 80% of women of all ages said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces. \nThe government will face cross-party pressure to use the crime and sentencing bill to take tougher action on crimes against women, when the wide-ranging legislation returns to the House of Commons next week. \nThe Guardian understands Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman will urge the government to enshrine the victim\u2019s right not to have their previous sexual history cross-examined in court, an amendment that has widespread cross-party support. \nThe government was also challenged by the Lib Dems\u2019 Wendy Chamberlain to make misogyny a hate crime as part of the domestic abuse bill. \nA cross-party amendment supported by a string of charities, including the Fawcett Society and the Jo Cox Foundation, would make all police forces in England and Wales record misogynistic crimes as hate crime, a campaign started by the Labour MP Stella Creasy. The amendment will be voted on in the House of Lords next Monday. \n\u201cThe challenge to the government is \u2013 pass the domestic abuse bill \u2013 it\u2019s been in the offing for four years. Legislate to make misogyny a hate crime. Make sure that those occupying positions of trust are people we really can trust,\u201d Chamberlain said. \nSpeaking in the debate, Phillips said it was abhorrent that the government still did not collect detailed data on the numbers of women killed each year and the circumstances of their deaths. \n\u201cIn this place we count what we care about, we count the vaccines done, we count the number of people on benefits, we rule or oppose based on a count and we obsessively track that data,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t currently count dead women \u2026 Dead women is this thing we\u2019ve all just accepted as part of our daily lives. Dead women is just one of those things.

Enough is enough. We must take a long hard look at society, at social media, at misogyny, at ourselves. And let\u2019s hope that next year\u2019s list is virtually non existent,\u201d she said. \nMarsha de Cordova MP, the shadow women and equalities secretary, criticised the minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, for not attending the debate, leaving Maria Caulfield to give the government\u2019s response. \nDe Cordova described the debate as, \u201cthe first time since the beginning of this pandemic that ministers have put aside time to talk specifically about women\u201d, and called it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that Truss had not attended. \nA spokesperson for the Government Equalities Office said Truss had an immovable diary commitment, but had contributed heavily to Caulfield\u2019s speech. \n \n In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid.

Related: Filip Helander's away goal heartens Rangers after slow start at Slavia Prague    While Solskj\u00e6r is hopeful Rashford, at least, could return for Thursday\u2019s second leg at the San Siro, Milan were certainly worthy of their vital away goal. Stefano Pioli\u2019s side were always positive and, for large swathes, the dominant force. It means United are now underdogs to progress to the quarter-finals.

I am not sure if he will be ready for the weekend \u2013 fingers crossed. And Cavani maybe, as well, for the Milan game.\u201d     Amad Diallo scored his first goal for Manchester United in his third appearance for the English side. Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images    Milan arrived in the mood to force the issue, and their pressing inside United\u2019s half caused problems. What Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side did not need to do was switch off, which they did when Davide Calabria\u2019s throw-in was allowed to reach Franck Kessi\u00e9. His 20-yard strike gave Henderson no chance but, after a delay, VAR ruled the midfielder had handballed to control. United remained in slumbering mode when Rade Krunic swept in a long free-kick that no red shirt wanted to claim aerially. Milan were caught offside but what United required were smelling salts to jolt themselves awake. There was zero pattern to their play. Instead, the visitors tapped the ball around in a manner that had the feeling of a schooling for United. When Bruno Fernandes could finally look ahead in possession, his intended pass was too short and the attack fizzled out. Instead, Calabria could thrust from right-back into United\u2019s area to cause havoc, and the home side escaped again in what was becoming a Harry Houdini-act of a half. Their next close shave came when Martial jumped out of a challenge near Milan\u2019s area. Suddenly, Brahim D\u00edaz broke fast, Alexis Saelemaekers took over and cut inside from the right. Henderson\u2019s fingers were warmed by his fierce effort. At that point, Harry Maguire shouted to his teammates to stop giving the ball away. The captain might also have implored his team to get out of backward gear, fast. But they did start to brighten and soon went close to an unlikely opener. Alex Telles swung in a corner from the right which Fernandes flicked on. He looped the ball over Gianluigi Donnarumma, who managed a faint touch, before Maguire hit the post from inches. The ball went across goal but somehow stayed out, and the score remained goalless. \u201cI won\u2019t make any excuses for that,\u201d the centre-back said. \u201cI should put it in the net.\u201d At the break, Solskj\u00e6r replaced the injured Martial with Amad Diallo, who was about to have a dream impact. Fernandes earned a free-kick in a central area and passed to Nemanja Matic, who gave the ball back to him. The Portuguese looked up, spied Diallo\u2019s clever inside-right run and expertly chipped it over. The youngster\u2019s flick past Donnarumma oozed class. It was a fine way to open his United account, and Milan were stunned. Their response was to bombard Henderson\u2019s goal, with Pioli\u2019s team feeling they should have had a penalty when Aaron Wan-Bissaka reached over D\u00edaz to head clear and the latter went down. As a spectacle, the contest continued to improve. Calabria zipped over a cross which Krunic flung his head at, connecting with the ball but unable to keep it down. Then United offered a rare counterpunch when Greenwood combined with Diallo, before finding Dan James in space. The winger was under no pressure, but his control faltered.

PC Wayne Couzens has been arrested on suspicion of the kidnap and murder of Everard. He has also been arrested on suspicion of an indecent exposure involving another woman, and this is the incident that will be investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). The alleged indecent exposure happened on 28 February, at a fast food restaurant in south London. Everard disappeared after leaving a friend\u2019s house in the south of the capital at about 9pm on 3 March and beginning a 50-minute walk home.  The IOPC said in a statement: \u201cThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has started an independent investigation into whether Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) officers responded appropriately to a report of indecent exposure. \u201cThe IOPC\u2019s investigation follows a conduct referral from the MPS in relation to two officers, received last night, which is linked to four other referrals. They are all connected to the arrest of a serving MPS officer on suspicion of kidnap, murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. \u201cOur investigation will look at the actions of the MPS after police received a report on 28 February (2021) that a man had exposed himself at a fast food restaurant in south London.\u201d The IOPC will investigate the claims about the indecent exposure allegation independently. The Met, Britain\u2019s biggest police force, was stunned by the news that the suspect was one of their own serving officers. The inquiry into Everard\u2019s disappearance was continuing on Thursday night, with searches continuing in Ashford, Kent at a site where police believe they have found human remains, which are yet to be formally identified. Sarah\u2019s family on Thursday spoke of their pain and painted a vivid picture of the joy she had brought to their lives.

We are now pleading for additional help from the public. Please come forward and speak to the police if you have any information. No piece of information is too insignificant. Thank you.\u201d It is understood the detectives believe whoever took Everard came across her at random, and did not know her previously. Couzens, who served in the parliamentary and diplomatic protection unit, remains in custody at a London police station after an application to extend his detention was granted at Wimbledon magistrates court, Scotland Yard said. He was initially arrested at his home in Deal, in Kent, on Tuesday on suspicion of kidnapping Everard, while a woman in her 30s was held on suspicion of assisting an offender. She has been released on bail to return to a police station on a date in mid-April. On Wednesday evening, the Met commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said the human remains, which have not yet been formally identified, had been found in an area of woodland about 20 miles west of Couzens\u2019 home and the suspect was further arrested on suspicion of murder. On Thursday, it emerged Couzens had been taken to hospital after suffering head injuries while in police custody. Scotland Yard said he was discharged back to his cell but refused to release any further details.

The downpour, officials and climate scientists say, is an example of the more intense rainstorms that are occurring more frequently as the planet warms. \nThe rainstorms this week first affected Maui, moved northward up the island chain to Oahu and Kauai, then circled around and hit the southernmost part of the Big Island. \nOn Oahu, flooding covered roads and yards in towns on the eastern coast. Rising waters in the Opaelua stream, which carries waters from the mountains down to the ocean, set off an evacuation order for the small town of Haleiwa, a mecca for big-wave surfers. Honolulu firefighters rescued a 27-year-old man after his truck was swept down a stream, and suspended the search for an individual a witness saw in a stream in Pearl City. \n \n  Related: Hawaii governor declares emergency after floods and landslides  \n \nMeteorologists on Wednesday extended a flash flood watch for the entire state through Friday because of the potential for more rain and because the ground was already saturated. \n\u201cThis is really an example of climate change in the present day,\u201d Suzanne Case, the head of the department of land and natural resources, said in a statement. \u201cWe have a flood emergency because of the heavy rain bomb. And we\u2019re seeing these more and more across the island chain \u2013 more frequent and more extreme events.\u201d \nThe warming climate is affecting rainfall patterns in the state. A 2010 report from the University of Hawaii\u2019s Sea Grant College Program said rainfall declined 15% over the prior 20 years. Yet the same report found between 1958 and 2007, rain events with the heaviest downpours increased 12%, underscoring that more intense rainstorms are growing in number. \nPao-Shin Chu, a University of Hawaii professor and the state\u2019s climatologist, said theoretical studies suggest that for every one-degree Celsius increase in sea surface temperatures, there is likely to be a 7% increase in atmospheric moisture. \nHawaii is experiencing some of this increased moisture already. In 2018, Kauai set a national record for the amount of rain recorded in a 24-hour period when 49.69in (1.26 meters) fell from 14 April to 15 April.

It\u2019s just reported a thumping annual loss of \u00a3517m as it took a \u00a3648m hit against the value of its department stores, eight of which closed for good last July. If pandemic support was designed to help businesses in crisis and minimise job losses, what\u2019s the problem? It\u2019s the fact that the picture was very different at Waitrose, recipient of \u00a385m of the partnership\u2019s overall tally of \u00a3190m of government support. The supermarket chain\u2019s sales were up 10% and top-line profits improved by \u00a382m to \u00a31.1bn.   Related:  John Lewis to close more stores as Covid crisis wipes out profits    To be scrupulously fair, the latter figure is a trading number, and so ignores central costs, some of which will have been inflated by the boom in online deliveries. Even so, the broad picture is correct: in financial terms, Waitrose did OK. So why can\u2019t the chain follow Tesco, Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrison\u2019s and Asda and return its relief from business rates? None of the pleas from the boardroom are persuasive. The partnership may think of itself as a single entity, but the relevant consideration with a property-based tax is surely whether the stores were open. The department stores were closed for 20 weeks, so, fine, keep that pot of money. But \u00a385m of relief for Waitrose can\u2019t be justified. Dame Sharon White, the chair, has overseen a decent crisis-fighting exercise at the department stores. Even if more stores may be lost as the pandemic compounds the effects of past overexpansion, the trading figures were better than feared. But on the Waitrose rates relief money, she made the wrong call.     A Royce Trent XWB engine on the assembly line at Rolls-Royce\u2019s factory in Derby. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    Rolls-Royce throttles back \u201cThe worst is now well behind us,\u201d said the Rolls-Royce chief executive, Warren East, after a year in which the engine-maker clocked up a colossal loss of \u00a34bn. The bigger question, though, is how long recovery takes. The best that can be said is that Rolls\u2019 predictions, made at the time of its \u00a32bn rights issue last October, have proved roughly accurate so far. One critical measure is engine flying hours, since it dictates the revenues received under maintenance contracts with big airlines. Rolls had assumed 2020 would see a fall to 45% of 2019\u2019s level \u2013 in the event it got 43%, which is near enough. For this year it thinks 55%, then 80% in 2022. The latter is a downgrade from 90% since the last finger-in-air exercise, which is not an immaterial difference since the rule of thumb says each percentage point equates to \u00a330m of receipts. But East is sticking to his critical forecast that Rolls will generate \u00a3750m of cash in 2022, which is the point at which the enormous restructuring exercise, involving 9,000 job losses, can be said to have worked. While it waits, Rolls would benefit from good news elsewhere in its business.

Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA    HSBC lumps it on coal The juiciest scrap during the upcoming season of corporate annual meetings was meant to be at HSBC, where a group of 15 fund management houses had filed a resolution calling on the bank to curtail its financing of fossil fuels. The resolution would probably have struggled to achieve the necessary 75% supermajority, but the potential for embarrassment for HSBC was high. Amundi, Europe\u2019s largest fund manager, was in the rebels\u2019 camp. BlackRock, the world\u2019s biggest, was under pressure to join, and thereby back the chief executive Larry Fink\u2019s high-minded climate words with hard votes. Thursday, however, brought news of a peace deal. HSBC will volunteer its own resolution to phase out the financing of coal and set targets to align its lending with the Paris agreement. In return, the shareholders will drop their proposal. Investors still have to back the board-led resolution and HSBC still has to live up to its commitments. But it is the first time that ShareAction, the charity that led the negotiations with HSBC, has withdrawn a shareholder resolution, so it\u2019s a landmark event of sorts.

This is a difficult place to come. Once we settled, we more than matched them.\u201d It was easy to make the case for Slavia before a ball had been kicked. The Czech league leaders have a formidable home record, with the exertions as attached to Rangers\u2019 weekend title triumph seen as having at least some impact.

Switches of play were a key aspect of Slavia\u2019s attack; from one of the first, the young Rangers full-back Nathan Patterson saw himself faced with both Peter Olayinka and Nicolae Stanciu.

But theatre cannot move quite this fast and even though Vivian JO Barnes\u2019 two-hander was inspired by the duchesses of Sussex and Cambridge, she conceived it in 2018 and it was filmed by Steppenwolf theatre at the end of last year. The marketing gods, however, could not have aligned the stars for a greater impact for the digital premiere of a play billed as \u201ca darker version of what might have happened if Meghan Markle had stayed\u201d. That line gestures towards the surreal, satirical and incrementally creepy tone of this 35-minute dualogue. Staged as a teatime meeting between The Duchess (Sydney Charles) and The Soon-to-be-Duchess (Celeste M Cooper), and directed by Weyni Mengesha, the couple\u2019s exchanges seem deliberately wooden and gather sinister undertones that climax in the grotesque act of the final moments. The Duchess is already grounded in the ways of the institution and performing royal duties and has recently given birth (\u201cI\u2019m leaking\u201d). She is meeting the Soon-to-be-Duchess in order to educate her in palace protocols for women \u2013 and black women \u2013 entering into royalty.           Watch an interview with the playwright Vivian JO Barnes    The Duchess seems more automaton than human \u2013 a regal version of a Stepford wife, lobotomised by institutional protocols, although sad vestiges of her former self remain. \u201cPretend you\u2019re not here,\u201d is her advice in the event of being surrounded by paparazzi. \u201cSay to yourself \u2026 \u2018They are not doing this to me.\u2019\u201d The Soon-to-be-Duchess, by contrast, is bright-eyed and bursting with character. She hopes to tear down the palace\u2019s icy traditions, though we begin to wonder how long it will take for her vivacity to be leached \u2013 or forcibly extracted. The actors add disturbing little flourishes to their performances and even when the script loses its subtlety, a greater sense of confusion and dread remains.   Related: 'I didn't want to be alive any more': Harry and Meghan describe racism and royal animosity in Oprah interview    The Duchess reads out one palace memo that commands her never to wear green because it is not \u201cbecoming\u201d on her. Another bears blatant suggestions of colourism that says she must endeavour to behave in a way that is \u201ca little less cocoa\u201d and \u201cmore beige\u201d. The Soon-to-be-Duchess admits she does not know how to curtsy and wants to skip the formal gesture but is told that she must do so at all times, even in a meeting as informal as this one. These moments of satire gain an almost incredible prescience in their critiques on race and female submission in relation to the British monarchy.  Of course it is all just fiction, but it might be seen as a kind of bellwether as to how Americans perceived the British royal family long before Meghan\u2019s revelations. The drama is the fourth in the six-part Steppenwolf Now virtual programming series, which brings together an array of dramatic forms and genres, from an engrossing two-part audio soap opera, Wally World, set in a department store and written by Isaac G\u00f3mez, to a thoughtfully angsty animation, Red Folder, written, directed and illustrated by Rajiv Joseph.

We need urgent societal change.\u201d \nThe facts are stark: a woman dies at the hands of a man every three days, according to the Femicide Census carried out by Karen Ingala Smith and Clarrie O\u2019Callaghan. According to their grim calculation 1,425 women and girls were killed in the UK between 2009 and 2018.  \nThose deaths are just the tip of a deep, profound and intractable iceberg, said Andrea Simon, the director of End Violence Against Women (Evaw). \u201cViolence against women and girls is an epidemic, and it has reached endemic proportions,\u201d she said. \nThe last year saw a global and national increase in domestic violence, and an increase in rape reports even as the number of prosecutions has collapsed. This week a UN Women UK survey revealed that almost all young women have experienced sexual harassment in public places. \nEvaw\u2019s most recent report from January reels off a battery of horrifying statistics: almost one in three women will experience domestic abuse, two women a week in England and Wales are killed by a current or former partner, more than half a million women are raped or sexually assaulted each year. \nSimon pointed out that it is rare for a woman to be killed, rarer still by a stranger. According to 2018 ONS data, 33% of female homicide victims were killed by partners or ex-partners, compared with 1% of male victims. \nBut the total number of women killed in the year ending March 2019 increased by 10% from 220 to 241, the second consecutive annual increase and the highest number since 2006. \nWomen\u2019s anxiety about walking streets at night is not irrational, but informed by knowledge of the violence women face on a daily basis, from micro-aggressions to murder, said Simon. \n\u201cWe all know that fear. Every woman knows that fear of what might happen, if they just go about their everyday lives without thinking and planning and making decisions about where they can go, what they should wear, where they should sit,\u201d she said. \nA major part of the problem is the criminal justice system\u2019s repeated failure, she said. Rape convictions, dropping since 2017, fell to a record low this year \u2013 only 1.4% of cases reported to the police resulted in a charge by the CPS. At least 1,000 fewer men accused of rape are currently being prosecuted than two years ago. \n\u201cThere needs to be a consequence, and the criminal justice system is not delivering that,\u201d said Simon. \u201cWhether it\u2019s sexual harassment, or the most serious sexual assault, there isn\u2019t really a penalty being meted out to the vast majority of offenders \u2013 so where\u2019s the deterrent?\u201d \nThe past 12 months has also been particularly bleak for those working in tackling domestic abuse. During the first national lockdown the National Domestic Abuse Helpline saw an 80% increase in calls; Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of so-called \u201chonour-based\u201d abuse and forced marriage reported a 162% average increase in caseloads. \nThe government\u2019s promise of \u00a3165m for domestic abuse support service falls far short of the \u00a3393m that Women\u2019s Aid estimates is needed for domestic abuse alone. And the last three months of 2019 saw domestic abuse prosecutions fall by almost a quarter. \nNo one at government level is joining up the dots, said Farah Nazeer, chief executive of Women\u2019s Aid. \nWith 92% of defendants in domestic abuse-related prosecutions in the year ending March 2020 recorded as male, and 77% female victims \u2013 the crime is heavily gendered. \n\u201cThere is a blindness about what causes violence against women,\u201d she said. \u201cThe abuse, harassment and murder of women is a reflection of systemic misogyny and sexism within society.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nThe domestic abuse bill, reaching its final stages, is progress, she said. It will create a new domestic abuse tsar, recognise abuse can be emotional and economic, and end the defence of \u201crough sex\u201d. Local authorities will have to provide safe accommodation to victims and their children, who are recognised as victims in their own right. \nBut, said Nazeer, it fails to reference the need and provision for \u201cwomen\u2019s refuges\u201d, which she fears opens the door to generic provision becoming more common in the sector. \nAccording to Imkaan research, 50% of specialist refuges have been forced to close or have been taken over in the last decade. \nFurther losses would be terrible news for black women and minoritised women, who are not only at greater risk, but are also more likely to be sidelined and ignored, said Pragna Patel, from Southall Black Sisters. \nAnd while she welcomed the domestic abuse bill, it could not be divorced from a wider conversation about how patriarchy is embedded in state structures, she said. \n\u201cWe need to explicitly acknowledge that violence against women and girls as a cause and consequence of gender inequality.\u201d \n \n  Related: The Guardian view on violence against women: without safety, there can be no equality | Editorial  \n \nNew compulsory relationships and sexuality education in England was a step forward, but undermined by parents\u2019 ability to opt out until the age of 15, she added. \nThe bill could also help shift the dial on the way violence against women is measured and treated, if an amendment to make all police forces to record misogyny as a hate crime is adopted, said Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow. \u201cI urge every woman who has walked with keys in her hands at night, been abused or attacked online or offline to come forward and be heard,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThis is our moment for change \u2013 women should be equally able to live free from fear of assault or harm simply for who they are.\u201d \nBut the law can only go so far, said Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice. \u201cLaws are only worth the paper they are written on if they are implemented and combined with informed understanding about the way that women are targeted by male violence,\u201d she said. \nAfter a devastating week, women working to end violence against women and girls were tired, she added. \u201cBut we have to remember that it\u2019s a battle,\u201d she said. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a reason to give up, it\u2019s a reason to keep fighting.\u201d \n \n In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women\u2019s Aid.

The chancellor said the pay offer, alongside plans for a wider public sector pay freeze, was \u201cproportionate, fair and reasonable\u201d given the damage to the government\u2019s finances caused by the pandemic and as many workers in the private sector have lost their jobs. Answering questions from MPs on the Commons Treasury committee on Thursday, Sunak said the process was being handled by the NHS pay review body but that it was a government decision to recommend the 1% increase. Ministers have insisted the nation could not afford a higher offer, sparking intense anger across the public sector. \u201cFor a matter of fairness, but also to protect people\u2019s jobs in the public sector given what was going on in the private sector, we set out a targeted approach to public sector pay, which we thought was proportionate, fair and reasonable,\u201d Sunak said. The chancellor said the plan came \u201cin recognition of the circumstances that we face\u201d with the government\u2019s budget deficit \u2013 the gap between spending and receipts \u2013 on track to reach \u00a3355bn this year. It comes after Sunak faced criticism that his budget lacked credibility for including plans to spend \u00a315bn a year less on public services from 2022-23 than envisaged before the Covid pandemic. Mel Stride, the Conservative chair of the Treasury committee, warned the legacy of the pandemic would probably include greater demands on public services, telling the chancellor: \u201cThe way I\u2019m looking at it there is a \u00a315bn cut relative to previous plans. I would\u2019ve thought that would be one of the areas where you\u2019d be worrying quite a bit about that.\u201d However, Sunak insisted it was not a cut, despite it being labelled as such by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. He said spending was set to rise by 2.1% once inflation is taken into account, which would leave the size of the state by the mid 2020s at historically high levels. \u201cSpending grows over the parliament and grows in every year. What you\u2019re referring to are changes in forecasts from previous fiscal events. That\u2019s not a cut in spending. Spending is growing over this parliament very strongly,\u201d he said. However, the chancellor hinted that permanently higher levels of tax may be needed in future to fund public services, despite concerns from backbench Tory MPs that the tax take as a percentage of GDP would rise to 35% \u2013 the highest since Roy Jenkins was chancellor in the late 1960s. \u201cIf there are demands on the spending side that are larger, it is reasonable to expect that those have to be paid for. I think most people will understand that,\u201d he said.     Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk    Sunak was also forced to defend the government\u2019s record on procurement of PPE and spending on its Covid test and trace programme, in the wake of highly critical reports from parliamentary watchdogs questioning value for money. \u201cGiven we were dealing with a pandemic it was appropriate that we approached this with a degree of flexibility,\u201d he said.

Biden is expected to use his televised speech to hail the stimulus bill known as the American Rescue Plan, which the White House has touted as the biggest progressive spending package in generations that is critical for steering the US towards the end of the pandemic.   Related: $1,400 stimulus checks and vaccine funds: what the Covid relief bill contains    But Biden is also expected to acknowledge the ongoing pain caused by the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of nearly 530,000 Americans and brought unemployment, hunger and dislocation to tens of millions more. And he is also expected to offer hope, asking for optimism as beleaguered Americans face what comes next. Previewing the speech, Biden said he will outline what his administration plans to do to help guide the US through a huge vaccination program and rebuild shattered lives and businesses in the months ahead. \u201cI\u2019m going to launch the next phase of the Covid response,\u201d the Democrat said on Wednesday. \u201cThere is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year.

Together, we\u2019re going to get through this pandemic and usher in a healthier and more hopeful future.\u201d A White House official said the speech will last less than 20 minutes and will note how controlling the pandemic and administering vaccines has been the \u201cgreatest operational challenge the country has faced\u201d. So far, more than 62 million people across the US have been vaccinated. Biden said this week that the US \u201chit a record of 2.9m vaccinations in one day in America\u201d on Saturday. The speech is resonant in its timing, coming a year to the day since the World Health Organization declared the spread of the coronavirus a pandemic. It\u2019s also a year to the night since Donald Trump, the former president, delivered a similar televised address on the pandemic that came after he repeatedly claimed the virus would somehow disappear on its own.   Related: 'It will disappear': the disinformation Trump spread about the coronavirus \u2013 timeline    One year ago the pandemic became tangible for most Americans, with many companies telling staff to work from home, if they were able to, sporting bodies such as the NBA canceling games and Broadway shows shuttering in New York City. The period since has seen waves of the virus surge across the country, with the deficient response of several states and the Trump administration seeing healthcare systems pushed close to collapse and millions of frontline workers, particularly people of color, suffer the brunt of the pandemic. At the height of the pandemic, more than 14% of working Americans were out of a job. Biden has sought to instill optimism over the course of the pandemic since becoming president, with the rate of new infections and hospitalizations now starting to fall. His administration has set a goal of 100m vaccine shots in the first 100 days, something the president was upbeat over in a visit to a Washington DC hospital this week. \u201cWe\u2019re really warping the speed now,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing pretty good across the country. We\u2019re going to hit 100m soon.\u201d Life remains upended for millions of Americans, however. The stimulus package is the first major legislative victory of Biden\u2019s presidency and promises to raise millions of Americans out of poverty. It includes $1,400 payments for eligible individuals along with hundreds of billions of dollars more to bolster vaccine distribution, extended unemployment assistance and child tax credits.

Challenges still remain in delivering vaccines, however, as well as the actions of several states, such as Texas, that have started to ease restrictions such as mask mandates. More than 18m doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine will be shipped to states, tribes and territories this week, the White House said, with another 100m additional doses of the single-shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine set to be delivered later this year. Biden has previously said there will be enough vaccine for all American adults by the end of May. There is still no plan for the vaccination of children, although the president is also hoping to push forward the reopening of schools.

The four-times major winner, who has slipped to No 11 in the world, had 34 putts. He three-putted four times.

The decision emerged in an emergency meeting on Thursday prompted by the resignation of Ian Murray, executive director of the industry body, over his statement in response to the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s claims in her interview with Oprah Winfrey. After Murray\u2019s withdrawal critics of the body had demanded a clearer repudiation of his initial statement than the clarification issued earlier this week. It is understood that after the meeting a new statement is being drafted. In the meeting, which one participant described as \u201ctesty\u201d and another as \u201cdifficult but a move towards a better result\u201d, most participants are understood to have agreed that stronger language was needed to bring the crisis to an end after a number of editors including those of the Financial Times, Guardian and HuffPost criticised the initial statement. Journalists and outlets from the Daily Mirror to the Bristol Cable have since withdrawn from at least some categories in protest. One participant said the meeting was dominated by \u201cdeep frustration and anger\u201d and concerns that the credibility of the body had been significantly damaged \u2013 to the extent that there was discussion of whether it was still capable of functioning properly. It is understood that at least one board member questioned the inclusion of language saying that structural racism was an issue in the British press. The board was seeking a position that would satisfy the SoE\u2019s critics and achieve a broad consensus, with fears that if it were to explicitly say that media outlets have published racist content or rely on racist structures other publishers could withdraw as a protest of their own. Seeking to push a clearer repudiation of the initial statement is a group including the news editor of the Voice, Vic Motune; PA Media\u2019s managing director, Polly Curtis; the former BBC editorial director, Kamal Ahmed; the former Sunday Times editorial director Eleanor Mills, and the editor of the i, Oliver Duff. On Thursday Motune added his voice publicly to those critical of the initial statement, writing on the Voice\u2019s website: \u201cAlthough the Society of Editors\u2019 executive director, Ian Murray, has resigned, my deep disappointment at his comments denying the fact that sections of the UK press are racist strongly remains.\u201d Noting that he had not been consulted on the initial statement and would not have approved of it, he added: \u201cThe comments do not represent what I know \u2013 the UK media fails to accurately reflect the lives and aspirations of all BAME persons in Britain.\u201d Some in that group had sought the postponement in the awards, due to be held on 31 March, with a number of outlets withdrawing from contention and the host, ITV News presenter Charlene White, also stepping back after the initial statement was released. Earlier on Thursday, 151 journalists of colour followed up an open letter earlier in the week with a new statement saying that while Murray\u2019s resignation was a reflection of the gravity of the circumstances \u201cthis has never been about one man\u201d. They went on: \u201cWe now look forward to the Society of Editors withdrawing its denial of the racism which exists in our industry and explaining more fully what action it will take to address it, starting with its own awards scheme, which has consistently failed to recognise the talent and achievements of journalists of colour.\u201d As evidence of that issue, the group pointed to analysis it has carried out showing that between 2017 and 2019, just six of 104 national awards to individual journalists went to journalists of colour \u2013 only two of them women. The Society of Editors has pointed to its Driving Diversity and Reporting Diversity categories as evidence of its attempts to improve the situation.

He picked up 3 women in the Bayview yesterday afternoon on San Bruno Avenue. https://t.co/Tzr7kTfyKQ pic.twitter.com/f8PiHDZ9CZ&mdash; Betty Yu (@BettyKPIX) March 9, 2021    The video shows Khadka being berated and coughed on by one of the women, who was riding in the back seat of his car without a mask. Khadka said he picked up the three women early on Sunday afternoon. He said the woman seated in the middle seat did not have a mask on, despite Uber\u2019s policy that riders must prove everyone is wearing a face covering before confirming their ride. Khadka began to drive off, but once he noticed the unmasked woman he reminded them of the policy and pulled over. The women asked him if he had an extra mask. Khadka told them he didn\u2019t, and he said that was when things started going downhill. \u201cThey tried to make it look like it was my fault even though they ordered Uber without a mask,\u201d Khadka said. \u201cThe girl that assaulted me started taunting me and asking how I could stop a car in the middle of nowhere but we were half a block from where I picked them up.\u201d Khadka said he then pulled into a gas station so the rider could buy a mask. While she was in the store the other two passengers allegedly began a barrage of violent threats and insults. \u201cBefore the girl came back with her mask I had to listen to taunts about how they could shoot me in the face and call their boyfriends and cousins on me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThey talked about how small my testicles are because of my race. They called me a goofy-ass N-word after every sentence.\u201d By the time the passenger came back to the car with a pack of masks, Khadka decided that the trip was not worth the risk to his safety. \u201cI told them that the ride was over and to please get out of the car,\u201d Khadka said. \u201cThey kept taunting me, telling me that I\u2019m nobody and that they would stay in the car. It was three ladies versus one guy who can\u2019t even verbally defend himself in English.\u201d Khadka said that he turned his camera on when he realized they weren\u2019t budging, and that was when the woman started coughing into his face and screaming at him. Seconds later the video shows the woman snatching Khadka\u2019s cellphone out of his hand. Khadka claimed that one of the women sprayed Mace inside the car after getting out. \u201cShe emptied her pepper spray can in my car. I accidentally put my hand on my face and it started hurting,\u201d he recalls. San Francisco police have said they are investigating the incident.    (1/4) The victim, a 32-year-old male, TNC driver picked up three passengers at San Bruno Avenue and Felton Street on March 7, 2021 at approximately 12:45PM.

She has since appeared to try to contextualize her actions in an Instagram video, admitting that she was wrong for coughing on Khadka, but she said that she was scared for her and her fellow passengers\u2019 safety because Khadka allegedly tried to kick them out in an unfamiliar area and refused to wait until a new rideshare arrived. The woman in the video has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for further comment. Khadka said he had been driving for Uber for three years but left when the pandemic began and started driving on and off for UPS. The decline in Covid-19 infections and vaccine rollout encouraged him to come back in January. Weeks later he was accosted. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much time I\u2019m gonna have to take to recover,\u201d he said. Khadka said that Uber initially offered him $20 in cleaning fees. \u201cThe frustration was that I asked for the cleaning fee and then they gave me $20 then $40 but I knew the extent of the damage to my car. Those droplets are everywhere; it\u2019s not safe to drive. I explained that and nothing was done.\u201d Khadka said the company has since deposited $250 \u2013 the estimate for cleaning that Khadka sent to Uber \u2013 in his bank account, and when his story became international news, a representative for the company offered more money in medical expenses and to compensate for the time he is taking off of work. Uber said it offered him additional money and other forms of support in recent days, according to an email sent to the Guardian. Khadka said he has yet to accept their offers for additional compensation.", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Heads in England fear pushy parents will demand better exam grades", "full_article": "School leaders fear teachers in England are being aggressively lobbied by \u201cparents with pointy elbows and lawyer friends\u201d to boost their children\u2019s GCSE and A-level grades this summer. This, they say, could have a devastating effect on the attainment gap between well-off and disadvantaged pupils. Richard Sheriff, executive headteacher of Harrogate grammar school and president of the Association of School and College Leaders, said he was worried that schools were being left exposed by the government\u2019s policy of replacing exams in England with grades awarded by teacher assessment. Sheriff said he feared that \u201cparents with pointy elbows\u201d would be more prepared to push for their children to receive better grades, meaning pupils with parents unable or unwilling to confront teachers were likely to be left further behind.   Related: England's teachers will feel the pressure over student grades this summer | Anonymous    \u201cWe must protect teachers. If this is all about who can shout the loudest to get their child the furthest, then we certainly won\u2019t be closing the attainment gap, will we? And we certainly won\u2019t be doing anything about social equality in any way whatsoever,\u201d Sherriff said, speaking before ASCL\u2019s annual conference, which begins on Friday. Geoff Barton, ASCL\u2019s general secretary, said the headteachers\u2019 union had warned the government there needed to be strict quality assurance mechanisms to take the pressure off teachers and allow them to justify their decisions. \u201cRight from the beginning, from the very first day, we\u2019ve seen examples of where parents have been emailing individual teachers, saying: \u2018My daughter wants to be a doctor in the future, she needs to get a grade 9 in chemistry at GCSE,\u2019\u201d Barton said. \u201cWe also have to protect teachers through all of this and when people talk about \u2018teacher assessment\u2019, it does seem to me to be unhelpful because it sends out the message that if I\u2019m your chemistry teacher, it\u2019s me sticking my finger up in the air. It won\u2019t be. \u201cThat\u2019s why we argued behind the scenes for a more robust quality assurance process to protect individual teachers and individual schools throughout this process.\u201d ASCL criticised recent comments by Simon Lebus, interim chief regulator of the exam watchdog Ofqual, that there would be \u201ca negotiation\u201d between students and their teachers over what their final grade should be. \u201cThat\u2019s certainly not the way we saw it,\u201d Barton said. The ASCL also warned that parents remained confused by the government\u2019s guidance about Covid testing in schools, in particular its decision that a pupil with a positive result from a school-administered lateral flow test could not return to the classroom even after receiving a negative result from a higher standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Reports from secondary schools suggested that students and staff had adapted well to more stringent mask-wearing routines since they returned this week. But Sheriff said his feeling from visiting classrooms was that there were downsides: \u201cI was in a classroom today and it\u2019s so difficult to gauge the mood of a class when you can\u2019t see their faces.\u201d   Related: English school leaders despair over new rules on Covid tests and masks    Since the return to school, some young people have been mixing socially outside school, including visiting each other\u2019s homes despite the remaining restrictions, which Sheriff said was a concern. \u201cWe only have control over a very small part of their day. Whether the return to school signifies a greater amount of that social mixing beyond the school is probably my biggest concern,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that, in school, controls are really good, generally they\u2019ve been very good indeed. But outside school, if going back to school is a signal that everything\u2019s fine and we can carry on as we are, then that\u2019s the dangerous bit.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 March 2021.

She is referring to the weeks of intense planning, hard work and attention to detail that went into the opening \u2013 just minutes earlier \u2013 of the Business Design Centre in Islington as the NHS\u2019s latest Covid mass vaccination centre. \nThe London exhibition centre usually hosts trade fairs. But on Wednesday the only visitors were 44 NHS staff, St John Ambulance personnel and volunteers, and about 200 grateful recipients of the jab, some of whom had waited in the rain outside to get into the venue. \nIt is now one of 134 mass vaccination centres (MVCs) in England, 15 of which opened this week alone. They are a key part of the vast infrastructure the NHS has established since November to administer the Oxford/AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines to \u2013 so far \u2013 about 20 million people. The 1,660-strong network of sites also includes 268 \u201chospital hubs\u201d for NHS and social care staff, 224 pharmacies and 1,034 GP-run sites, many of which are family doctor surgeries. \nChurchward is already a veteran at helping to create MVCs. The Business Design Centre is her fifth. Her usual role is as director of strategy at University College London hospitals NHS trust. But when the pandemic struck she switched to setting up coronavirus testing centres, and then to establishing premises to speed up the rollout of the vaccines. NHS England have put UCLH in charge of organising the vaccination programme to the 1.5 million people who live in the London boroughs of Camden, Islington, Haringey, Barnet and Enfield, working in partnership with other hospitals and GPs in the area. \n \n  \n  \n  The Business Design Centre is the fifth centre Laura Churchward\u2019s has helped create. \n  Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian \n  \n \nThe new MVC delivered 200 jabs in the three and a half hours it was open for on Wednesday. \u201cBut that will increase to 500 a day from next week, thanks to increased vaccine supply,\u201d says Churchward. The deployment of the vaccines across England has been impressive so far but should move up another gear next week when the number of jabs delivered daily is planned to double from about 400,000 to 800,000. \nVaccine supply in UCLH\u2019s five boroughs has been uncertain, Churchward admits. \u201cLast week it was touch and go whether or not we\u2019d have enough vaccine to open up this site today, so we had to get 500 doses from the Francis Crick Institute,\u201d the scientific research centre behind the British Library in central London, which is also doubling as an MVC. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to move vaccine around the system on a weekly basis to ensure each site has enough.\u201d \nUltimately the glass- and steel-roofed hall will be able to host 2,500-3,000 jabs daily. \u201cThese MVCs are there to jab big numbers of people \u2013 mega-numbers. They\u2019re for the mainly healthy population, not the elderly and vulnerable who were done at first.\u201d \nThe vaccinators on day one included Ed Wild, a professor of neurology, as well as an ICU nurse and A&amp;E staff, who all usually work at UCLH. \u201cThis is the NHS at its best,\u201d says Churchward. \nThis is the second time the Business Design Centre has helped the country achieve a key goal since it opened in 1862 as the Royal Agricultural Hall. The bombing during the second world war of the Mount Pleasant post office half a mile away led to its inland and foreign parcels departments being rehoused at the hall. \nThere are 421 floor stickers to guide arrivals around in a socially distanced way. The centre has 24 vaccination booths, 78 hand sanitiser stations, 55 computer stations and 202 blue plastic chairs for those waiting for their turn, going through check-in or giving their consent. \n \n  \n  \n  A view of the the Islington Business Design Centre set up as an MVC. \n  Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian \n  \n \nDiana Kootstra, UCLH\u2019s construction programme manager, inspected the hall in December and judged it to be an ideal MVC because of its size, accessibility, good public transport links and excellent ventilation. Once she worked out how to ensure safe patient flow around it, UCLH reached a deal with its owners. A team of 17 architects, quantity surveyors, engineers, data analysts and a construction team have all played their part over the last 10 weeks \nIt was originally due to open on 22 February. That had to be delayed, though, because of uncertainty over whether there would be enough vaccine available, and also whether enough people would be eligible to come, which itself depended on how quickly the nine priority groups for vaccination, as decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, were invited. That has now reached group eight, those aged 55 and over. \nIvan Clark, a 62-year-old data analyst, was one of the first to get jabbed at the repurposed venue. Consent has to be taken by a doctor or nurse, so he gave his to a UCLH nurse. He received his jab in his left arm from Neal Pun, a second-year medical student at University College London. While some of the vaccinators are NHS staff, many are volunteers who have been trained. \n\u201cIt was seamless. I only had to wait for five minutes. All the marshals showed me where to go,\u201d said Clark, who wore his West Ham face mask throughout. \u201cI was utterly gobsmacked that we beat the 15.2m target before the 15 February deadline that Boris Johnson set. I analyse all the government data every day and the vaccination rollout is a success story \u2013 it\u2019s incredible.

Celebrated for its customer service, but under pressure to shift away from physical retail and into online sales as it nurses pandemic losses of \u00a3500m, the retailer is poised for major change. Shoppers fear that could mean the final blow for many local high streets. The group closed eight department stores last year, including large spaces in Birmingham and Watford, smaller At Home stores in Croydon, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, and two in travel hubs at Heathrow airport and St Pancras station in London. The fate of up to eight more now hangs in the balance as John Lewis says it expects to conclude negotiations with landlords before the end of this month. While those stores have not been named, shoppers expressed fears their local outlet would be on the list. Residents in towns and cities across the country already know their local Debenhams or House of Fraser will not reopen, making the potential loss of a John Lewis an even heavier blow. \u201cJohn Lewis has always been part of my retail shopping life, having shopped there and in Waitrose for as long as I can remember,\u201d said Sharon Goddard, 64. \u201cThe store in Norwich is a great place to shop with wonderful staff. It is the heart of the city, and now that Debenhams has gone its importance has grown even more. If it were to close, the inhabitants of Norwich and Norfolk would miss it incredibly. It would rip the heart out of this historic city.\u201d Another long-term fan, Christine Dunn from Penarth in Wales, said: \u201cIt will be devastating for Cardiff if it closes.\u201d Dunn said her fears for her nearest store\u2019s future had been raised after it seemed poorly stocked on a visit last summer. \u201cWe made the journey in to support the shop and Cardiff city centre.

The exchange, seen by the Guardian, suggests Alex Bourne, a former publican who had no prior experience of producing medical devices before he began supplying the government, may have downplayed his relationship with Hancock in public. The messages, which suggest an easy familiarity between the two men, were sent in late November, shortly before the Guardian published a story about Bourne\u2019s work supplying the NHS and his links to the health secretary. In a WhatsApp message Hancock sent to Bourne about the imminent story, the health secretary called the newspaper \u201ca rag\u201d.

The disclosure of the messages is likely to intensify pressure on Hancock to fully explain how Bourne\u2019s company came to be awarded lucrative work supplying test tubes for use in NHS Covid test kits. Bourne, Hancock and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) have all insisted the health secretary had no role whatsoever in awarding the work. Bourne\u2019s company, Hinpack, which he runs from his father-in-law\u2019s industrial potato farm in Cambridgeshire, has been beset by problems. It recently voluntarily recalled at least 8m test tubes that had been delivered to warehouses for the NHS over quality issues. Bourne initially offered his company\u2019s services to the health secretary at the start of the pandemic in a personal message sent to Hancock\u2019s WhatsApp on 30 March. Those messages have not been publicly revealed, but Bourne said Hancock referred him to the DHSC website. At that time, Hinpack made plastic cups and takeaway boxes for the catering industry. The company\u2019s 2019 accounts state Hinpack was at that time technically insolvent. His lawyers said the Companies House filings at that time reflected the fact Hinpack was a startup and its debts were loans from Bourne himself, \u201ca man of private resources\u201d. The firm was able to convince officials in the NHS supply chain and two of its major distributors that it was capable of supplying tens of millions of sterile test tubes. In total, Bourne has been asked to supply orders worth nearly \u00a350m for Covid tests as a subcontractor to one of the NHS\u2019s official distributors, Alpha Laboratories. Bourne\u2019s lawyers deny that Hancock helped their client in any way and have also denied the pair are friends, saying they were merely \u201cacquainted\u201d. Hancock has refused to be drawn on the nature of his relationship with Bourne, who ran a village pub close to his former constituency home. \u2018Matt Hancock \u2013 never heard of him\u2019 The WhatsApp exchange seen by the Guardian took place on 25 November, the day before the newspaper published its first story about the pair. Both had been asked questions about the nature of their relationship and whether Bourne had received any preferential treatment. At 3.38pm, Hancock wrote to Bourne: \u201cApparently we are appearing in the Guardian together tomorrow. I am accused of \u2013 shock horror \u2013 having your phone number. Apologies in advance for this uninvited publicity. What a rag.\u201d Seven minutes later, Bourne replied: \u201cMatt Hancock \u2013 never heard of him. We managed to get the chain of events on how we ended up supplying NHS along with supporting evidence that shows you were nothing to do with us.\u201d Referring to a London law firm he had hired to deal with inquiries from a female reporter, Bourne added: \u201cI\u2019ve got Carter-Ruck all over her like a [t]ramp on chips. No apology necessary, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve implicated you in something by association.\u201d The phrase \u201clike a tramp on chips\u201d is offensive slang that means with the enthusiasm that a hungry homeless person would approach discarded food.     WhatsApp messages between Matt Hancock and Alex Bourne. Composite: The Guardian    The law firm Carter-Ruck promises to help clients deal with \u201cunwanted media interest\u201d, claiming on its website that it has an \u201cunrivalled track record in using its legal and strategic expertise to prevent the publication of adverse and intrusive articles\u201d. It remains unclear precisely how Hinpack came to be selected as a major supplier of medical devices to the NHS \u2013 or exactly how often Bourne and Hancock have communicated with each other. When first asked in November, Carter-Ruck flatly denied that Bourne had any discussions with Hancock in relation to Covid supplies. Bourne later backtracked, conceding he had in fact exchanged text and email messages with the health secretary over several months. According to Bourne, after sending Hancock the initial WhatsApp message in March 2020, he formally submitted details of the work Hinpack could do on a DHSC website for prospective suppliers. Bourne\u2019s lawyers said he sent Hancock another WhatsApp message on 4 April, to which the health secretary did not respond. Around mid-April Bourne said VWR, a distributor of medical products that had a framework agreement to supply the NHS, called him. After several conversations, VWR ended up asking Bourne to supply test tubes for the NHS. Bourne\u2019s lawyers said he sent Hancock another private message on 14 May, informing him he had won a contract. Since early autumn, Bourne has been supplying test tubes via Alpha Laboratories, another medical distributor with a pre-existing contract to supply the NHS. Hinpack is specified as the sole subcontractor in one \u00a340m contract between DHSC and Alpha Laboratories. Bourne\u2019s lawyers say he has not sought to avoid scrutiny of his contacts with Hancock, and said that after every exchange he sent the DHSC a note to ensure there was a record of their conversation. However, responding to a recent freedom of information request for the dates of their communications last year, the DHSC said its records showed Bourne and Hancock had communicated only once \u2013 on 25 August. It made no mention of the numerous WhatsApp messages between the two in March, April, May and November, or other communications believed to have taken place in June and September. Although only a subcontractor, Bourne has had repeated direct communications with DHSC officials. Several sources have said Bourne regularly boasted about his close relationship with Hancock in conversations with those officials, as well as business partners and employees. Other sources have described Bourne and Hancock as \u201cfriends\u201d and \u201cbuddies\u201d. His lawyers described allegations that he had boasted about his relationship with Hancock as \u201cunsubstantiated embroidery\u201d. Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, said: \u201cThe health secretary has some extremely serious questions to answer here. The government must urgently investigate these utterly shocking messages.\u201d Faulty test tubes Meanwhile, there are mounting questions about Bourne\u2019s capacity to supply safe and reliable vials to the NHS. In December a DHSC report recorded the results of checks on 11,000 Hinpack test tubes due to be assembled into kits for the public. Sterile and leakproof test tubes are an essential component as they are used to securely transport swabs to laboratories. Remarkably, the DHSC report, seen by the Guardian, noted that all 11,000 were faulty, being either cracked, broken, scratched or with missing or poorly screwed caps. After the checks, Bourne recalled his supplies \u2013 at least 8m test tubes \u2013 from warehouses and agreed to quarantine them. Hinpack\u2019s consultant quality manager, Micha\u0142 Kisiel, who is based in Poland, told the Guardian that Bourne had recalled his stock from NHS logistics hubs because tubes did not pass pressure tests, meaning they could not be guaranteed as leakproof. \u201cDHSC asked for tubes that pass this test. If they contain swabs from patients, they must not leak,\u201d he said. Previously, Bourne\u2019s lawyers had said the medical devices produced by Hinpack were \u201cby no means complicated and are well within our client\u2019s existing skillset\u201d. They said the recent recall of millions of vials was caused by DHSC changing the product specification. A government source said that after Hinpack\u2019s recall of test tubes, a site visit was conducted and the company had provided all of the necessary evidence that appropriate processes \u201care now in place\u201d to ensure products meet the necessary standards. DHSC is rolling back its orders for the Covid test programme and, as part of that, it is understood to be seeking a dramatic reduction in the number of Hinpack vials ordered through Alpha Laboratories, requesting a cut in volume of up to 75% on a \u00a340m order placed in December. Substantial numbers of Hinpack\u2019s plastic test tubes are alleged to have been burned in recent months without a licence at various properties to which Bourne had access, including in his own garden. The Guardian has seen evidence of one such fire, with test tubes scattered around the base of a fire sending huge plumes of black smoke into the sky. The Suffolk fire service had to attend another outdoor fire at Bourne\u2019s home to extinguish it on 2 January. Bourne\u2019s lawyers said it was \u201cuntrue\u201d that Hinpack test tubes had been disposed of in unlicensed fires. They said the 2 January incident at Bourne\u2019s property was related to \u201ca mistaken burning of domestic carpet underlay\u201d.   Do you have information about this story?

Bourne\u2019s lawyers denied allegations of hygiene failures and said their client was unaware of the investigation by the regulator. They said he \u201cvery much regrets\u201d his choice of language in his WhatsApp message and had no desire to stifle proper factual reporting. A DHSC spokesperson stressed Hinpack does not have a \u201cdirect\u201d contract with the government and said \u201cclaims that ministers were directly involved in procurement decisions or contract management are false\u201d. The spokesperson said the impartiality and integrity of government procurement \u201cis taken extremely seriously\u201d. Hancock declined to comment. When asked about Bourne\u2019s work at a Downing Street press conference in December, Hancock replied: \u201cI had absolutely nothing to do with that contract.\u201d In February, when the health secretary gave TV interviews from his constituency home, viewers spotted a photograph of Bourne\u2019s pub on his wall. The photo has since been removed.     A picture of Bourne\u2019s pub, the Cock Inn, is seen on the wall behind Hancock. Composite: Handouts    In a statement, Alpha Laboratories distanced itself from the recall of vials, which happened at the behest of Hinpack. \u201cWe have a rigorous quality management system and within this have a robust product recall system which thankfully has been rarely used.\u201d It said its quality system received no details of quality issues relating to tubes supplied by Hinpack.

After reports that several minors were among the dead left by the bombing raid, Diego Molano said on Wednesday that any young victims were \u201cmachines of war\u201d who had been indoctrinated by the guerrillas. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they were studying for their school exams,\u201d said Molano, who once headed Colombia\u2019s child welfare agency. He would not confirm if any minors had been killed, but said that the airstrike was entirely legal. Molano\u2019s comments incensed many in a country long used to the horrors of civil war, with the hashtags \u201cMachines of War\u201d and \u201cMolano Resign\u201d trending on Twitter. \u201cThe state should reach the regions in order to guarantee housing, food, health and education,\u201d tweeted Heidy S\u00e1nchez, a Bogot\u00e1 councilwoman. \u201c[But] in Colombia it arrives to drop bombs. Who are the machines of war?\u201d The 2 March airstrike in the eastern Guaviare province targeted dissident rebels who once belonged to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). Those dissidents, under the leadership of a commander known by the alias Gentil Duarte, split with the Farc after the group\u2019s 2016 peace deal with the government.   Related: Armed groups target Colombia's children as reform process slows    That agreement formally ended over five decades of bitter war that killed more than 260,000 people and forced over 7 million to flee their homes. During the war, the Farc and other rebel groups recruited minors \u2013 a practice that dissident factions have continued. Local news reports and opposition lawmakers have claimed that as many as 12 minors may have perished in the operation, though forensic authorities have not yet confirmed the ages or identities of the dead. The defence ministry only said that 12 people had been killed. At least one child \u2013 Danna Lizeth Montilla, 16 \u2013 is known to have perished in the strike. Her father, Jhon Albert Montilla, told the local newspaper El Tiempo on Thursday that she had been staying with family in the rural region, and may have been forcibly recruited by the rebels. \u201cIt\u2019s something that has become common,\u201d Montilla told the newspaper. \u201cBut I never thought it would happen to my daughter.\u201d Montilla added that the defence minister\u2019s insensitive comments did little to help. \u201cFor the minister of defence, children aged 13 14, and 16 have been turned into \u2018war machines\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very sad that kids are called that.\u201d The incident was not the first time children have been killed by government bombs. After eight children were killed in an August 2019 bombing raid, the then defence minister, Guillermo Botero, resigned. He had also been accused of attempting to cover up the identities and ages of those killed. Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that while the government may be able to prove that it followed International Humanitarian Law, the real outcry is over Molano\u2019s response. \u201cOne would expect a top security policymaker to say, \u2018Even though we feel we followed the law, this is a tragedy. It\u2019s heartbreaking that the armed group put children in harm\u2019s way. These kids never had a chance at a better life, and we Colombians have to do better for them,\u2019\u201d Isacson said. \u201cInstead, Diego Molano portrayed these children as expendable killers who deserved what they got,\u201d he said. \u201cThat kind of dehumanising language stripped Molano himself of his humanity, and it\u2019s an absolutely terrible message to send to an armed forces with a difficult history of human rights abuse.\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Norton Juster obituary", "full_article": "Norton Juster, who has died aged 91, wrote The Phantom Tollbooth, which became a classic for children of all ages. It tells the story of a boy named Milo, who is both bored and boring. One day he finds a package in his bedroom, from which he assembles the flat-packed eponymous tollbooth, and through which he proceeds in his toy electric car. He finds himself enmeshed in an ongoing conflict between Azaz the king of Dictionopolis and his brother the Mathemagician, ruler of Digitopolis. Tasked with rescuing the princesses Rhyme and Reason, Milo \u2013 accompanied by Tock, a watchdog who sports an alarm clock on his torso \u2013 begins an epic journey through a world filled with wordplay. Juster recalled his own childhood, in which he experienced synaesthesia. \u201cI couldn\u2019t do numbers if I didn\u2019t see colours,\u201d he explained, and in many ways his writing is about translating things differently from what may have been intended. As Milo learned: \u201cSo many things are possible just as long as you don\u2019t know they\u2019re impossible.\u201d It was 1961, and The Phantom Tollbooth was like a child\u2019s antidote to the drab 1950s; Milo could be a younger version of Holden Caulfield who discovers a world with which he can be involved. It might also be seen as an American version of Alice in Wonderland, though where Alice delves into Lewis Carroll\u2019s deep Victorian unconscious, Juster\u2019s Milo is a child having his consciousness unlocked. Juster always denied the influence; instead he said his book was inspired by his father\u2019s incessant punning and his familiarity with Marx Brothers movies. \u201cThey were absolutely insane \u2026 and then you\u2019d see them again and again and you realise they made all this good sense,\u201d he said.     The Phantom Tollbooth was published in 1961. Photograph: AP    Juster was born in Brooklyn, New York. His parents, Samuel, an architect, and Minnie (nee Silberman), were immigrants from Romania. Despite the punning, and his great love of literature, Norton was expected to follow his older brother into his father\u2019s trade. He took a degree in architecture from the University of Pennsylvania and then studied city planning on a Fulbright grant at Liverpool University. After his return to the US, he was drafted into the navy, spending three years as an engineer, and winding up at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. After his discharge he eventually founded his own architectural firm, and won a Ford Foundation grant to write a book about urban perceptions. Procrastinating on that project, he began jotting down notes about Milo\u2019s story. It might have never been more, but one night, taking out the trash at his Brooklyn duplex, he met his upstairs neighbour, the cartoonist Jules Feiffer. \u201cWe started exchanging wisecracks,\u201d Feiffer recalled. Juster showed Feiffer his story, and Feiffer began drawing illustrations. Juster began writing things more and more difficult to illustrate; Feiffer retaliated by drawing Juster into the story as The Whether Man. But it was Feiffer\u2019s wife, Judith, who took the book to Jason Epstein at Random House; Epstein was not a children\u2019s editor, and he saw past the standard evaluations. \u201cEverybody said this is not a children\u2019s book,\u201d Juster explained. \u201cThe wordplay, and the punning; they will never understand.\u201d But of course children did, and what we didn\u2019t understand at first, we understood the next time we read it, or the next. Sparked by a favourable review in the New York Times, the book became a bestseller. Juster followed in 1963 with The Dot and the Line: A Romance In Lower Mathematics, about a line who discovers his own ability to illustrate quadratics and wins the dot away from the anarchic Squiggle. As Juster wrote: \u201cTo the vector belongs the spoils.\u201d In 1965 it became an Oscar-winning short film, narrated by Robert Morley and co-directed by Maurice Noble and Chuck Jones, best known for Looney Tunes\u2019 Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, who revel in their own wordplay. In 1970, Jones co-wrote and co-directed a full-length version of The Phantom Tollbooth, featuring the voices of Mel Blanc, June Foray, Daws Butler and Hans Conried. Its remarkable animation includes Milo\u2019s drive through the Doldrums, where the Lethargians melt round his car like Dal\u00ec watches. In 1964, Juster married Jeanne Ray, a graphic designer. He was also teaching at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, along with Earl Pope, his partner in their architectural firm. In 1970 they moved to Massachusetts, to join the founding faculty at Hampshire College, an experimental liberal arts college started by four institutions \u2013 the University of Massachusetts, and Amherst, Smith and Mount Holyoke Colleges \u2013 based in the area. Juster would teach there for 20 years, though he could be very critical of the educational process. \u201cIt\u2019s really the appearance ... and credentials of education they\u2019re worried about. I think at birth they should give every child a PhD.\u201d His firm, which became Juster Pope Frazier, designed buildings on those campuses, as well as the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst; Carle illustrated Juster\u2019s Otter Nonsense (1982). His other children\u2019s books include Alberic the Wise (1965), illustrated by Domenico Gnoli, As Silly As Knees, As Busy As Bees (1989), for which the illustrator Chris Raschka won a Caldecott medal, and its sequel, Sourpuss and Sweetiepie (2008). In 2010, he and Feiffer reunited to produce a tale of bullying, The Odious Ogre. But the legacy of The Phantom Tollbooth just grew. In 2011, Leonard Marcus edited an annotated version; in 2012 a documentary film, The Phantom Tollbooth: Beyond Expectations, appeared. In 2017, a stage musical debuted in Washington DC. Each generation had its eyes opened, and parents would again revel in the advice of the Terrible Trivium: \u201cIf you only do the easy and useless jobs, you\u2019ll never have to worry about the important ones that are so difficult.\u201d Adults going back to it would discover new relevance. \u201cEverybody is so terribly sensitive about the things they know best,\u201d seems particularly apt for the social media age. Jeanne died in 2018. Norton is survived by their daughter, Emily, and a granddaughter. Feiffer remembered Juster as his \u201coldest friend\u201d and said that their \u201cwisecracks never improved or diminished\u201d. \u2022 Norton Juster, writer and architect, born 2 June 1929; died 8 March 2021", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Letter: Chris Cramer obituary", "full_article": "Chris Cramer may not have seen eye to eye with his father in his younger days, as John Simpson notes, but the intense love and affection they shared in later years is undeniable.

A serving Metropolitan police officer has now been arrested on suspicion of her kidnapping and murder. Cressida Dick, the Met commissioner, told reporters: \u201cIt is thankfully incredibly rare for a woman to be abducted from our streets. I completely understand that despite this, women in London and the wider public \u2013 particularly those in the area where Sarah went missing \u2013 will be worried and may well be feeling scared.\u201d As her remarks suggest, the case has sparked a potent reaction. For many women, it has tapped into far broader concerns about the abuse and violence they face. Six women and a little girl have been reported as killed since Sarah Everard went missing, noted Jess Phillips, Labour\u2019s shadow minister for domestic violence. Harassment and assault by men are anything but rare. It is more than 40 years since the first Reclaim the Night march, which was prompted by the Yorkshire Ripper murders and the police response, telling women to stay at home after dark. Now a Reclaim These Streets vigil is to be held in Clapham on Saturday. Women are exhausted. The frustration and rage vented on social media and in parliament is the product of a society where it is normal for women to live in fear. This week, a survey for UN Women UK found that almost all young women in the UK \u2013 97% of 18- to 24-year-olds \u2013 have been sexually harassed; almost none reported it. Almost every woman has tales of encounters ranging from verbal abuse to physical assaults \u2013 often dating back to her childhood. While women of all ages are at risk of violence, girls and young women appear especially vulnerable to male violence in public places. Women spend their lives planning routes, clenching keys and readying themselves to run. But online, many also recounted lists of what they do not do, from visiting friends once the sun has set to walking alone in the countryside \u2013 trading freedom for safety, in the words of Professor Liz Kelly, an expert on violence against women. \u201cWe do safety work all the time and it costs us \u2013 our time, our imaginations, our space to experience joy, our embodiment,\u201d she wrote. Yet women cannot keep themselves safe by staying at home: on average, two a week in England and Wales are killed by abusive partners or ex-partners \u2013 and the numbers are feared to have risen since the pandemic began. As new realms open up, women\u2019s freedoms are curtailed there too. Online threats and harassment are rife. There is real cause for concern that extreme online content is spilling over into offline life. We teach girls to shrink their lives, while doing too little to educate boys and men not only to respect women, but also to challenge those who do not do so. Sexual harassment may come at one end of the spectrum of male threat, but it creates a climate in which women feel unsafe and predatory men are emboldened. The government should consider a street harassment law like that introduced in France. But its priority must be turning around the dismal record on tackling violence. Rape prosecutions have dropped every year since 2016-17 \u2013 more than halving in that time \u2013 and are now at a record annual low. The number of domestic abuse prosecutions fell by almost a quarter in the last three months of 2019. Slashed funding has closed refuges across the country. The cash promised in the budget is a fraction of what is needed. Years of work have delivered precious victories. This week, the House of Lords backed amendments to the domestic abuse bill that create statutory defences for women driven to offend. Much more still needs to be done.

He put a brave face on a crushing disappointment. This should have been a wonderful series, but as with so much sport at the moment, Covid put paid to that. Being in a bubble and having to play four Tests in rapid succession are not conducive to proper sporting contests. England were undone by a rather ham-fisted squad rotation system that saw key players coming and going at regular intervals. The idea is well-meaning \u2013 England have an impossibly demanding schedule this year and fear player burnout \u2013 but the policy was disrespectful to India, currently the world\u2019s strongest cricketing nation. England have said that they might resort to rotation again during the series against Australia in the winter, but will they really? One feels that the series against India is seen as a rung below an Ashes tour: an outdated view now that India are so compelling. Mr Root\u2019s pleasingly counterintuitive big idea is to make English domestic cricket more boring by giving extra bonus points to teams that manage to eke out a draw. Forget the gung-ho, win-at-all-costs mentality long espoused by England; bat long and bowl tight is now Mr Root\u2019s mantra. Geoffrey Boycott, that stubborn occupier of the crease, will be delighted. Mr Root reckons the pitches in the county championship are too helpful for the medium-pace trundlers who have always been the backbone of the English first-class game, and wants better wickets that encourage out-and-out fast bowlers and spinners. It was India\u2019s spin supremacy that was the difference in the Test series. Mr Root\u2019s notions are eminently sensible. Traditionally, Test batsmen have learned to play big innings, and bowlers have developed a bit of mystery in the county championship \u2013 the long form of the game beloved of cricketing purists. The problem, though, is that those four-day games will henceforth be relegated to the beginning and end of the season: fresh spring and dewy autumn \u2013 when conditions favour the sort of English-style seam bowlers who would rarely do much damage on a benign Test match pitch. This summer will be given over largely to one-day cricket, in particular the launch of The Hundred, the controversial attempt to compete with the razzmatazz of the Indian Premier League. English cricket needs a rethink and overhaul, not least when there appears to be a longstanding failure to address institutional racism. But it is also being pulled in two directions: between the playing needs of the Test team and the perceived financial needs of the game more widely. Long-form cricketers will not be developed amid the pyrotechnics of The Hundred. A quick 30 could win a match in the latter; in Test cricket batsmen need to be capable of scoring double-hundreds. England will resume their battle with India on Friday, with a fresh set of personnel and playing the Twenty20 format in which they currently lead the international rankings. They are unlikely to crumble as they did in the Test matches, but the conundrum for English cricket is that privileging this form of the game may be damaging the Test team.

And all this week, it has been Sarah Everard\u2019s. When she went missing, any woman who has ever walked home alone at night felt that grim, instinctive sense of recognition. Footsteps on a dark street. Keys gripped between your fingers. There but for the grace of God. She was a perfect stranger, someone I have never met nor had any connection with. But half the women I knew were sharing her image on social media feeds, willing her to make it home. Even though we know that home is where women are statistically most at risk. Women who vanish stick in our heads precisely because they are rare. It\u2019s men who are more likely to be killed in public places, invariably by other men; meanwhile two women a week die at the hands of their own partners on average, and mostly nobody hears their names. The Labour MP Jess Phillips, who reads those names out in parliament every year, said on Thursday that by her count, six women and a little girl had been murdered in the days since Sarah Everard had vanished. That doesn\u2019t make one form of violence against women any more or less shocking than another. It just means that misogyny takes many forms; and that our primal fear of it bleeds into everything. It turns what may sometimes seem to men relatively trivial street encounters into something darker. It\u2019s why we\u2019re instinctively frightened of feeling trapped, dependent, with no way out. This hasn\u2019t felt, in short, like a week to hang out the bunting for International Women\u2019s Day. And yet mark it we should, by noting both how far we\u2019ve come and how very far there still is to go. What would a woman born a century ago make of this world now? Thanks to the feminist icon Betty Friedan, I\u2019ve been wrestling with that question all week. The Feminine Mystique, her great roar of fury against the lies American women had been sold, was republished this week as an ebook. All the better to reach a new millennial audience to whom she is mostly familiar as the character Tracey Ullman played with gusto in the drama series Mrs America; spiky, difficult, brilliant but flawed. I was asked to write an introduction for it and, since Friedan is no longer alive to do the book tour, the publishers have had to make do with me. Stepping briefly into her shoes was mildly terrifying, but what interviewers generally seemed to want to know was whether the high priestess of second-wave feminism would view the present condition of women with elation or despair. What would she make of Meghan, a duchess trapped in what, by her own description of it, might as well be a 1950s housewife\u2019s stifled life? Where would she stand on trans rights? Would she think we\u2019d moved mountains since 1963, when the book was originally published \u2013 a world where she could be fired with no right of redress for getting pregnant, and had no legal right to abortion \u2013 or be appalled at how much hadn\u2019t changed? The America she wrote about is a distant country now, a world of suburban female desperation slowly unfurling behind closed doors. Women had been told the path to true happiness lay in finding a man, having babies, and then settling down to a life of contentedly sewing their own curtains. Well, Friedan\u2019s book blew that idea sky-high, revealing the frustration, misery and rage seething beneath the surface of housewives\u2019 supposedly idyllic lives. She carried her reporter\u2019s notebook into privileged neighbourhoods where doctors were dishing out antidepressants like sweeties, and diagnosed in these women not neurosis but the pressing need for a job and life of their own. True, in parts the book shows its age now; some of the language is frankly homophobic and the argument revolves chiefly around the lives of white, middle-class women who could afford not to work, not the millions who had no choice. But to re-read it trapped at home by lockdown, an experience that turned back the clock for too many women but particularly for those with abusive partners, was to feel it come alive again. In the book she boggles at how easily the suffragettes\u2019 gains were rolled back, as their daughters\u2019 generations were persuaded that all the battles had been won; that there was something dreary and old-fashioned now about those first-wave feminists, and that therefore they could relax. Her warning never to get that complacent again feels fiercely contemporary now. Even Betty Friedan struggled sometimes, as the Duchess of Sussex might say, to speak her own truth. The book and the movement it unleashed made her a household name. But what she didn\u2019t reveal at the time was that while her public career was taking off, her marriage was violently unravelling. Before she went on television to bang the drum for women\u2019s liberation, she would sometimes have to cover bruises with makeup. Yet she agonised in private about whether getting a divorce might somehow undermine the message, playing into her critics\u2019 charge that feminists were bitter women who had somehow failed at life. Even after the autobiography in which she spoke candidly about all this came out, her by then ex-husband Carl insisted he wasn\u2019t a wife-beater, that they\u2019d both lashed out; and for whatever reasons Friedan herself downplayed the issue in subsequent interviews. For the author of myth-shattering books to shatter the myth of her own supposedly happy family life proved unexpectedly hard. I genuinely don\u2019t know what she would have made of Harry and Meghan, publicly ripping plasters off raw wounds in a way that also now feels as if it may be unlocking something bigger. But I think she would have known exactly what to make of those two women who still, on average, die every week at the hands of abusive partners, and of the 50% of young men who nonetheless tell surveys that feminism has somehow gone \u201ctoo far\u201d. So what I do want to celebrate this week is difficult women. The flawed ones, the spiky ones, the ones you may not even like, but who have something awkwardly necessary to say. (Odd how it\u2019s millennial snowflakes who are accused of running away from challenging ideas, yet it was Piers Morgan who stormed off air rather than accept that a duchess he finds irritating might still have a point.) The young and the righteous, of course, but also the older ones who don\u2019t always get so much airtime and have lost the patience to tiptoe around the issue. And perhaps, above all, the ones who have been banging on about the same old things for decades now, but only because the same old things haven\u2019t changed fast enough, and women still keep dying of them.

The 62-year-old father-of-three was accused of lunging at the woman after inviting her to his house in Chelsea following a work meeting in 1998, while his pregnant wife was away. Prosecutors alleged that Odey had showered and put on a robe before putting his hand down her shirt and up her skirt during the incident. Odey, who was 39 at the time of the alleged assault, nodded briefly at the district judge on Thursday after being read the verdict, which found him not guilty of one count of indecent assault. While the hedge fund manager admitted he raised the possibility of sleeping with the woman, then in her mid-20s, he denied the charge. District judge Nicholas Rimmer said there were \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in the woman\u2019s account of the incident. Returning his verdict at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday, Rimmer said: \u201cI am left unsure of [the complainant\u2019s account] because despite the strength of her emotion and tears, her credibility has been thrown into question and her evidence is riddled with troubling inconsistencies.\u201d He added: \u201cWhere there is any doubt in a criminal case, given the high standard of proof, it must be resolved in favour of the defendant.

Its finances have been the victim of the totally inadequate council tax for decades, and an ever-reducing central grant. In addition, for a number of years, most councils accepted the government\u2019s \u201ccouncil tax freeze grant\u201d, effectively a bribe not to raise council tax rather than face a local referendum if they did. As a result, the county council of which I was a member during that period stopped being a provider and became a \u201ccommissioner\u201d of what services survived. It saw its staff reduced by nearly two-thirds over a five-year period. Had it not taken the freeze grant but raised its share of council tax by 2% per year, my council would have been better off by around \u00a340m. Local government still has the ability to deliver, but it needs urgent reform, so let\u2019s start by replacing council tax with something more progressive and then complete the transformation of the first tier of local government in England into the unitary format.John MarriottNorth Hykeham, Lincolnshire \u2022 The government is mean about funding local government, particularly Labour councils. But one thing it could do at very little cost is relieve councils of debt, which would remove the burden of annual repayments. Around 75% of council borrowing comes from the Public Works Loan Board and the maximum amount that the government can lend this way is \u00a395bn. It is funded through the issuing of public bonds via the Debt Management Office. That means the government could buy back these bonds through the Bank of England and wipe off PWLB debt at a stroke. This is what happened in 2012, when it used quantitative easing to buy back \u00a3375bn of bonds held by banks to improve their liquidity. Even if the government reduced the PWLB by half, for a city like Liverpool this would reduce annual repayments by around \u00a315m and provide millions of pounds of extra borrowing capacity that can be used for housing and other infrastructure investment. And it would cost the government nothing. Barry KushnerLabour councillor, Liverpool city council \u2022 Your excellent editorial (9 March) praising public spaces misses one key point.

It\u2019s about commonplace neighbourhood services \u2013 street cleaning, mending pavements, looking after parks properly, tackling antisocial behaviour including a return of youth services, refuse collection, pest control, traffic management, street lighting, community policing, public lavatories, and all the rest. High-profile, expensive services such as adult and children\u2019s care, major highways, fire and police are vital, but it\u2019s the local neighbourhood services that are most forgotten and which matter so much. These are often run by district councils \u2013 or town and parish councils \u2013 which are left out of government funding.Tony Greaves Liberal Democrat, House of Lords \u2022 Re local government funding, obvious but unremarked correlations warrant comment.

Legal action mounted by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants called for the Home Office to extend the deadline to ensure that those who miss the 30 June cut-off date do not become undocumented and liable to detention and removal. \u201cOn 1 July 2021 anyone who has yet to apply, or apply successfully, will be left without immigration status and exposed to the consequences of the hostile environment; at risk of losing their jobs, homes, access to benefits, and healthcare, driving licences, detention, criminalisation and removal \u2013 a second Windrush, but on a much bigger scale,\u201d Paul Bowen QC for the JCWI told the court. During a permission hearing, lawyers for the JCWI said the home secretary had failed to collect enough data to ensure adequate action was being taken to encourage vulnerable groups to apply before the deadline. \u201cIn the absence of that data she is pressing a policy outcome which is highly likely to have severe discriminatory consequences: she is driving blind towards the cliff-edge,\u201d Bowen said. Some groups of people are thought to be less likely to have applied for EUSS by the June deadline \u2013 particularly older EU residents, children, physically or mentally disabled individuals, women in relationships involving domestic abuse or Roma people, the court heard. However, rejecting the request for a judicial review, Justice Nathalie Lieven said it was the nature of all application schemes that there needed to be a deadline, and noted the Home Office\u2019s argument that there would be a period of grace for those people who could show that they had reasonable grounds for making a late application. The details of how long that period will last, and how the exemptions will be implemented, have yet to be published. By the end of December 2020 4.9 million applications to the scheme had been received, and 4.6 million people had been granted permission to remain in the UK; 54% of them were granted permanent status, and 43% were given the more temporary pre-settled status. The JCWI acknowledged that the vast majority of applicants have experienced little difficulty, but said some groups were likely to find the process more challenging, and are more likely to see their applications fail.  The charity accepted that the Home Office had taken some steps to avert the discriminatory consequences of the policy, but stated that without attempting to get more data to establish how many people are struggling to apply, there is \u201cno way of knowing whether those steps are adequate\u201d. The Home Office has acknowledged that certain groups will find it more difficult, such as women in controlling or coercive relationships, children and those who lack the physical or mental capacity to apply, but David Blundell QC, acting for the department, said that steps had been taken to encourage applications from those groups. Satbir Singh, the chief executive of the JCWI, said: \u201cWe are deeply disappointed at today\u2019s decision. The fact remains that in June, tens of thousands of EU citizens are at risk of falling through the gaps and being made undocumented. They will then be subject to the same hostile environment which has already ruined the lives of countless people, including the Windrush generation. \u201cBoris Johnson and Priti Patel promised that all EU citizens would get an automatic right to stay in the UK. Not only have they broken that promise, they have created a scheme which discriminates against older people, disabled people, looked-after children and many others. The government must do the right thing and lift the June deadline.\u201d A Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cThere have been 4.6 million grants of status under the EU Settlement Scheme already, securing people\u2019s rights in UK law. The scheme is simple and straightforward, with a wide range of support available online, over the phone and in person for those who have questions or need help applying.

For the vast majority, life in Glasgow is not a grim death sentence. The city is Scotland\u2019s largest urban economy and its base for arts and media. Glasgow is home to three universities, one of the world\u2019s most prestigious art schools and \u2013 in the west and south \u2013 some of the UK\u2019s most culturally vibrant and bourgeois districts outside London. This does not detract from Glasgow\u2019s appalling social inequalities, but it is far from the hopeless, dying city portrayed in the article. It must be noted that while Glasgow city council has Scotland\u2019s lowest life expectancies, Scotland\u2019s two council areas with highest life expectancy, East Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire, both fall within Greater Glasgow. They are home to 203,000 people and both begin just a couple of miles from the city centre yet are excluded from Glasgow\u2019s demographic data. This counterpoint rarely makes its way into media portrayals of the city. Lastly, there is the loaded term of the \u201cGlasgow effect\u201d itself. The Glasgow Centre for Population Health, whose use of the phrase in the title of a 2010 report, now discourages its use as the mystery surrounding excess mortality has been solved. There is no \u201cGlasgow effect\u201d, only a policy effect that has left long-lasting damage. Glasgow is undergoing an unprecedented level of development, socially and commercially. The article\u2019s lopsided portrayal of the city will only add to the social apartheid it discusses and deter tourism and investment. There is much more to Glasgow than ill health and desolation.

Martin Saberi, 55, murdered Amy Griffiths in her flat in Droitwich Spa, Worcestershire, in January 2019 while he was on the run for stabbing another woman in the neck outside a supermarket near his home in Wallington, Surrey, three days earlier. Saberi, who at the time of the attacks was out on licence after serving 16 years for robbery, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 24 years and 10 months, after which he will be almost 80. Worcester crown court heard that Saberi attacked 51-year-old Griffiths with a baseball bat, strangled her and stabbed her in the neck before stealing her laptop and Xbox and travelling to London where he handed himself in to police a few hours later. The judge James Burbidge QC said: \u201cThere are a number of aggravating factors \u2013 Amy was killed in her own home and when you left her dead you stole some of her belongings \u2013 a despicable act. The violence you engaged in was extreme.\u201d The prosecutor Rachel Brand QC told the court how on 11 January 2019 Saberi stabbed a 59-year-old woman, the mother of his friend\u2019s ex-partner, in the neck outside a shop after a drinking session. The victim recovered but was told by hospital staff she was \u201clucky and could have died\u201d. The next day Saberi messaged Griffiths to tell her he was coming to visit and travelled up to her housing association flat in Droitwich, a visit that came as a surprise to the victim. Brand said Saberi and Griffiths had met online via a transgender dating site and had met in person only once before, in June 2018, but had exchanged numerous messages over a period of months that appeared to show an affectionate relationship. Griffiths is believed to have been killed during the night of 13-14 January, with neighbours hearing some loud noises coming from the flat in the early hours. Saberi, who is said to have a number of mental health conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and personality disorder, appeared at the sentencing hearing via video link from the high-security Broadmoor hospital in Berkshire. The judge said he accepted mental illness was a factor in the killing but \u201cwhether it was a significant factor is difficult to determine\u201d. He said there was no suggestion \u201cthis was a murder aggravated by hostility towards the deceased because of her transgender identity\u201d. Saberi had a string of previous convictions for violent crimes, starting with an indecent assault on a woman in 1993, and in 2000 was sentenced to life imprisonment for a robbery where he entered a jewellery shop posing as a customer and threatened staff with a gun. Saberi initially pleaded not guilty to the murder before switching to a guilty plea on the day his trial was due to begin in February.

After finishing the list, Phillips added people had \u201cprayed that the name of Sarah Everard would never be on any list\u201d and urged everyone to work to ensure \u201cnobody\u2019s name ends up on this list again\u201d. \n   \n   \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n   \n   The government has been forced to delay the introduction of import checks by six months, in a major U-turn of post-Brexit policy, because a network of 30 border posts being built to process incoming goods would not have been ready on time. \n   \n   \n   The UK\u2019s economic recovery will be investment-led and will not need more consumer incentives like the Eat Out to Help Scheme to recover, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said. Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury committee he said he expected the levels of pent-up demand built up during the pandemic to be enough to trigger a recovery in consumer spending. As PA Media reports, experts predict middle and high income households have saved a combined \u00a3180bn since the pandemic and expect to spend at least 5%, or \u00a39bn, when restrictions ease. Sunak told the committee: \n   \n   \n   I think we probably now have higher confidence that there will be consumption-led recovery even without intervention... Consumer confidence is at different levels and there\u2019s actually a lot of pent-up desire. \n   Investment is different and has really suffered. It\u2019s down 20% year on year and unlocking that is probably something where policy can make a real difference. \n   \n   \n   Three-quarters of British manufacturers are struggling to cope with delays in moving goods in and out of the EU amid continuing disruption caused by Brexit and the Covid pandemic, industry figures said. \n   \n   \n   Delaying the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine must be urgently reviewed for cancer patients after a single shot was found to offer inadequate protection, researchers have said. \n   \n   \n   The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued a statement saying people should continue to take the AstraZeneca vaccine - even though the Danish, Norwegian and and Icelandic authorities have temporarily suspended its use because of concerns about blood clots. The MHRA says it has not been confirmed the blood clot in Denmark was caused by the vaccine. \n   \n  That\u2019s all from me for today. But our coronavirus coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It\u2019s here. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus live: shutdown in S\u00e3o Paulo as cases spiral out of control; Portugal extends state of emergency  \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.46pm GMT \n \n \n  5.30pm GMT  \n  \n  The UK has recorded 6,753 new coronavirus cases, according to today\u2019s government dashboard update. That is the highest daily figure for almost two weeks, and as a result new cases are now down 13.8% week on week, whereas yesterday they were down 20.1% week on week. But the amount of testing being carried out week by week is up by almost 70%, which would help to explain a rise in positive cases being uncovered. \n  And the UK has recorded 181 further deaths. Over the last week the total number of deaths is down 35.9% on the total for the previous seven days. \n   \n    \n    \n    Dashboard. \n    Photograph: Gov.UK \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 6.01pm GMT \n \n \n  5.14pm GMT  \n  \n  In its letter to Matt Hancock (pdf), the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation pointed out that some councils (such as Oldham) have already been giving the homeless priority for vaccination. It said: \n   \n   Almost half of this population are, in practice, unable to access primary care, through a combination of either being unregistered or no longer based near where they are registered. These risks are compounded by challenges in adhering to recommended physical distancing and infection prevention control measures, along with often poor symptom recognition or disclosure and barriers in engaging with contact-tracing activities. \n   Due to current restrictions, many thousands of people who experience rough sleeping have been accommodated in emergency accommodation. This provides a unique opportunity to in-reach vaccination to a population that is otherwise often unable to access basic healthcare. JCVI is aware that some areas have taken local decisions to prioritise this highly vulnerable group alongside group 6, and this approach is considered to fall within the operational flexibility advised by the committee. \n   \n  The JCVI also said homeless people should get a first dose of vaccine even if they do not have an NHS number. It said: \n   \n   It is recognised that an NHS number is an important element of the vaccination programme to ensure quality care and appropriate monitoring and surveillance. However, this requirement systematically excludes a vulnerable group of the population. The committee understands that the first dose of vaccine may be offered without the need for an NHS number or registration with general practice, but timely provision of the second dose is challenging without registration and the ability to call back individuals. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.18pm GMT \n \n \n  4.36pm GMT  \n Homeless people in England to be prioritised for vaccine, government says \n  \n  Homeless people in England are going to be prioritised for the vaccine, the government has announced. \n  They will be included in priority group six, meaning they will be treated the same as people with underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of serious disease or death. Group six adults are being vaccinated after the over-65s, but before over-60s. \n  Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said he was taking the decision on the basis of advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. Yesterday the Welsh government announced the same move for Wales. \n  In a statement today Hancock said: \n   \n   Our vaccination rollout is moving at an incredible speed with two in every five adults now having received at least one vaccine. It\u2019s so important that nobody gets left behind in this national effort. \n   We know there are heightened risks for those who sleep rough and today I have accepted the advice of the independent experts at the JCVI to prioritise those experiencing rough sleeping or homelessness for vaccination alongside priority group 6. This will mean we will save more lives, among those most at risk in society. \n   \n  In its letter to Hancock (pdf), dated 1 March but only published today, the JCVI said: \n   \n   Having noted that many homeless individuals are likely to have underlying health conditions which would place them in group 6 of the first phase of the programme and that these conditions are likely to be under-diagnosed or incompletely recorded in primary care records, JCVI advises that local teams exercise operational judgment and consider a universal offer to people experiencing homelessness and rough sleeping, alongside delivery of the programme to priority group 6, where appropriate. \n   \n  \n Updated at 5.01pm GMT \n \n \n  4.23pm GMT  \n  \n  Sunak says the decision to cut the aid budget was not taken lightly. But it was a matter of priorities, he says. He says \u201cat this difficult time\u201d the government decided to focus on domestic priorities. \n  \n \n \n  4.13pm GMT  \n  \n  Ali says in the Commons Jess Phillips, her Labour colleague, has been reading out in the Commons the names of women killed by a man in the last 12 months. She says funding for women\u2019s refuges should be increased. \n  Sunak says the budget contained an extra \u00a3125m for tackling domestic violence. \n  \n \n \n  4.08pm GMT  \n  \n  In the Treasury committee Rushanara Ali (Lab) is asking the question now. \n  Q: The NHS says it needs another \u00a38bn to avoid cuts in the next financial year. Will they get it? \n  Sunak says he will not conduct that negotiation in public, but he says the Treasury is providing the NHS with \u201can enormous amount of extra resources\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  4.02pm GMT  \n  \n  This is what Rishi Sunak said earlier in the hearing when he was asked by Anthony Browne (Conservative) if a larger state and higher taxation were here to stay. (See 3.04pm.) Sunak implied the answer was yes. He said: \n   \n   Obviously, the government has to raise the money to fund the public services it is committed to delivering, so those two things always have to be in sync. And if there are demands on the spending side that are larger, it is reasonable to expect that those have to be paid for. Most people will understand that. \n   And that\u2019s what the forecasts reflect; they reflect a large amount of public spending, financed - as governments do finance it - largely by taxation, and then borrowing getting to sustainable levels. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.59pm GMT  \n Four new cases of P1 Brazilian variant found in England \n  \n  Four more people have been found to be carrying the P1 variant of the coronavirus, which emerged in Brazil, bringing the total number so far to ten. \n  The arrival of the P1 variant in the UK sparked a manhunt in early March, when six cases were picked up but only five could be identified. The other person had not left their contact details after taking a test. The search narrowed to a few hundred households in south-east England before the missing person came forward in Croydon. \n  Most of the newly identified P1 cases are contacts of two of the originals in South Gloucestershire. The two had flown back from Sao Paulo in Brazil to London, via Zurich. Unsurprisingly, the three new ones in the same locality are either family members or close contacts. \n  The other new case lives in Bradford and tested positive for Covid after returning from Brazil via Paris on February 14, said PHE. Genomic testing confirmed the variant. People who have been in close contact with the individual have been advised to self-isolate and get a test. \n  P1 is classified by Public Health England (PHE) as a \u201cvariant of concern\u201d. It carries a mutation called E484K, as well as other changes, which is believed to reduce the efficacy of vaccines. \n  PHE says it has now identified another new variant in the UK, in two people who came back from Antigua. This one, which has been named B13241, is a \u201cvariant under investigation\u201d rather than of concern. Although it contains E484K and N501Y, which is another problematic change in the virus spike protein, it does not have other changes needed to make it either more easily spread or cause more severe disease. \n  The arrival of another new variant from abroad while the UK is still in lockdown does pose the question, however, of how easily they can be kept out once foreign travel is resumed. \n  \n \n \n  3.54pm GMT  \n  \n  Fewer students dropped out of their university courses in the current academic year, despite the chaotic start endured by many students last autumn, according to new data published today. \n  The Student Loans Company said it received 14,421 notifications of withdrawal by UK and EU students from undergraduates courses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by mid-February, which was 2,000 fewer than the previous year and the 15,800 recorded in 2018-19. \n  In a statement it said: \n   \n   Based on this data, SLC has not seen any increase in student withdrawal notifications for the purpose of student finance in this academic year, compared to the previous two years. In this respect, withdrawal notifications are currently slightly lower than the previous two years for UK &amp; EU students funded by Student Finance England, Student Finance Wales and Student Finance Northern Ireland. \n   \n  But the SLC said some of the difference \u201cmay be explained by the irregular start to the current academic year,\u201d with delayed course start dates and some universities extending their withdrawal deadlines as a result of the lockdowns and coronavirus outbreaks on many campuses in September and October. \n  \n \n \n  3.54pm GMT  \n  \n  Fewer students dropped out of their university courses in the current academic year, despite the chaotic start endured by many students last autumn, according to new data published today. \n  The Student Loans Company said it received 14,421 notifications of withdrawal by UK and EU students from undergraduates courses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by mid-February, which was 2,000 fewer than the previous year and the 15,800 recorded in 2018-19. \n  In a statement it said: \n   \n   Based on this data, SLC has not seen any increase in student withdrawal notifications for the purpose of student finance in this academic year, compared to the previous two years.

Here\u2019s an extract. \n   \n   As you know, the ministerial code states: \u201cIt is of paramount importance that ministers give accurate and truthful information to parliament, correcting any inadvertent errors.\u201d \n   I note you have so far made no attempt to clarify your remarks personally, and in failing to do so may have inadvertently broken the ministerial code. \n   I further note that your press secretary, Allegra Stratton, has attempted to clarify your remarks further today by stating they referenced a different vote. If this is the case I believe it is in the public interest that you clarify the situation yourself through a statement to parliament to abide by the code. \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.36pm GMT \n \n \n  3.25pm GMT  \n  \n  The SNP\u2019s Alison Thewliss goes next. \n  Q: When you published the winter economic plan, you said it was wrong to keep people furloughed in jobs that no longer existed. Do you still think that? \n  Sunak says that if a job is not going to survive, he wants to ensure people can find work, and do not suffer the scarring effect of unemployment. \n  \n \n \n  3.23pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: Have you benefited from the huge increase in the Moderna share price as a potential investor? \n  Sunak says all his disclosures have been published in the usual way.  \n  \n \n \n  3.19pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: Are you worried about the large number of PPE contracts that have gone to Tory donors? \n  Sunak says the Treasury is not the awarding department for those contracts. The health department is. All contracts go through eight tests, he says. \n  Now most PPE is manufactured domestically, he says. \n  \n \n \n  3.18pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: Yesterday there was an excoriating report on test and trace. Nick Macpherson, former permanent secretary at the Treasury, said this the most wasteful public spending programme of all time. Yet no one was shocked. Were you shocked? \n   \n   \n    The wins the prize for the most wasteful and inept public spending programme of all time. The extraordinary thing is that nobody in the government seems surprised or shocked. No matter: the BoE will just print more money. #soundmoneyhttps://t.co/m0Hc7ch0kd\u2014 Nick Macpherson (@nickmacpherson2) \n    March 10, 2021\n    \n   \n  Sunak says an enormous effort was put in to increase testing. That has been a fantastic achievement. \n  \n \n \n  3.14pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: Why are nurses just worth a 1% increase, which is a real-terms cut? \n  Sunak says that was not part of the budget process. He ways the pay review body is looking at it. That process will conclude towards the summer. \n  \n \n \n  3.13pm GMT  \n  \n  Angela Eagle (Lab) goes next. \n  Q: Why are you planning to spend less on public services than you originally planned? \n  Sunak says what looks like a cut is just an adjustment based on the inflation forecasts. \n  Q: Why have you not told the NHS what extra money it will get for Covid costs next year? \n  Sunak says there is always an ongoing conversation with departments about that money. He says he thinks \u00a355bn was set aside for extra funding next year. Not all of it has been allocated already, he says. \n  \n \n \n  3.10pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: Will there be scope for \u201cfiscal relaxation\u201d (ie, tax cuts) in later budgets? \n  Sunak says it is too early to speculate. \n  \n \n \n  3.09pm GMT  \n Delaying EU import checks reduces risks of 'empty shelves' in shops, say retailers \n  \n  Turning away from the committee for a moment, here is the government news release about the decision to delay the full imposition of post-Brexit border checks on imports from the EU. The move is intended to \u201cenable UK businesses to focus on their recovery\u201d, the government says. \n  Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he welcomed the delay but said it could \u201conly be a temporary solution\u201d. He said: \n   \n   What businesses want to see is an end to the damaging political rhetoric from both sides, and a focus on improving border flow for the long term. \n   The UK and the EU must get back around the table and thrash out the remaining structural problems in the trade and co-operation agreement. \n   For some UK firms, the continued problems with EU trade are threatening their very existence. \n   It should not be the case that companies simply have to give up on importing from, or exporting to, the market next door. \n   \n  And Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said he was pleased by the move. He said: \n   \n   With many of the key border control posts currently little more than a hole in the ground, the six month easement comes in the nick of time. \n   Until the infrastructure is in place, with IT systems ready and established processes for checks and paperwork, it would be foolhardy to introduce full requirements for EHC documentation, pre-notification of imports, physical checks and more. \n   We welcome the government\u2019s decision, which will ultimately reduce the impact on consumers from April 1, who might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products. \n   Government must not rest on its laurels, and the next six months must be used to establish and communicate the new systems with UK retailers and EU suppliers. \n   \n  \n \n \n  3.04pm GMT  \n  \n  Anthony Browne, a Conservative, goes next. \n  Q: Your plans take the tax burden to the highest level since Roy Jenkins. Is that permanent? \n  Sunak says the government must honour the spending plans it set out in the manifesto. The budget reflects that, he says. \n  UPDATE: From my colleague Richard Partington \n   \n   \n    Interesting from Sunak sticking to higher taxes? Asked if highest tax burden since 1960s is here to stay, he says: \"If there are demands on the spending side that are larger, it\u2019s reasonable to expect those have to be paid for. I think most people understand that.\"\u2014 Richard Partington (@RJPartington) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  FURTHER UPDATE: See 3.45pm for the full quote. \n  \n Updated at 3.46pm GMT \n \n \n  3.00pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: What can you do to incentivise people to spend the money they saved during the pandemic? \n  Sunak says he did not look at this specifically in the budget. When things reopen, we will find out if people are going to spend. Last year confident was not high, he says. \n  Dan York-Smith, Treasury director for strategy, planning and budget, who is giving evidence alongside Sunak, says the OBR has described increased spending of money saved as an \u201cupside risk\u201d (ie, a welcome surprise). \n  Q: What is an acceptable level of debt to GDP? \n  Sunak says, given the level of uncertainty, he did not think it was right to set a target. \n  But the steps he is taking do put the public finances \u201con a much more sustainable footing\u201d, he says. \n  He says 90% used to be a figure, based on the Reinhart and Rogoff principles. But that was revised, and it was based on interest rates being higher. \n  \n \n \n  2.54pm GMT  \n  \n  Q: Are you concerned about the impact on the economy of EU workers having left the UK? \n  Sunak says he has read reports on this. He says he does not have data on the impact this might have, but the Treasury is looking at it. \n  \n Updated at 2.56pm GMT \n \n \n  2.47pm GMT  \n  \n  Stride says he is willing to bet that Sunak\u2019s spending plans will come under \u201cinordinate pressure\u201d (meaning he believes Sunak will have to spend more, not less). \n  \n \n \n  2.45pm GMT  \n Sunak rejects claims his spending plans 'unrealistic' as MPs grill him over budget \n  \n  Stride says he would have said his biggest worry about the budget was the spending figures, the cost of further Covid measures for the NHS, the cost of the NHS operations backlog, the cost of the education catch-up, the pressure to increase universal credit - and that\u2019s before you mention social care. He suggests the numbers in the budget on public spending are \u201cunrealistic\u201d. \n   \n   Is it just not the case that the current numbers you have got in there on spending are unrealistic and are just going to come under unbearable pressure over the coming spending round and the years ahead? \n   \n  Sunak says there is a \u201csignificant uplift\u201d on public spending in the plans. So the starting point is higher than it was, he says. \n  He says the current plans envisage government spending increasing by about 3.5% more in real terms over the course of this parliament. \n  But how that is allocated is a matter for spending reviews. \n   \n    \n    \n    Rishi Sunak (right) and Dan York-Smith, Treasury director for strategy, planning and budget, giving evidence to the Treasury committee. \n    Photograph: Parliament TV \n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 3.31pm GMT \n \n \n  2.39pm GMT  \n  \n  Stride says we know the government is now sensitive to an increase in interest rates.  \n  Sunak says interest rates are exceptionally low. Although there are arguments for rates staying low, if inflation expectations change, interest rate expectations will change too. \n  He says previous changes have extended the maturity of UK debt. It extends 12, 13, 14 years. Most other G7 debt is about half that, he says. \n  \n \n \n  2.34pm GMT  \n  \n  Mel Stride (Con), the committee chair, starts. \n  Q: Apart from Covid, what are the key risks to the forecasts in the budget? \n  Rishi Sunak says the budget forecasts are based on the roadmap. \n  But the impact of Covid will last longer. The forecasts assume a 3% hit to the economy in the medium term from the pandemic. The biggest factor will be if that is greater or less. \n  \n \n \n  2.30pm GMT  \n Rishi Sunak questioned by Commons Treasury committee about budget \n  \n  Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is about to give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the budget. \n  There is a live feed here. \n  \n \n \n  2.25pm GMT  \n  \n  Covid-19 case rates are continuing to fall in all regions of England, according to the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England. PA Media says: \n   \n   In Yorkshire and Humber the rate of new cases stood at 97.6 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 7 March - the highest rate of any region, but down from 115.6 in the previous week. \n   The east Midlands recorded the second highest rate: 84.0, down from 122.9. \n   South-west England recorded the lowest rate: 32.3, down from 43.9. \n   \n   \n   \n    We've just published our weekly #COVID19 surveillance report.Read it here: https://t.co/8dYt9zEVk9\u2014 Public Health England (@PHE_uk) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 2.41pm GMT \n \n \n  2.23pm GMT  \n  \n  The 6 May elections across England, Scotland and Wales are going to be unusual in several ways, and the Electoral Commission has just published new guidance about some of the many things parties and candidates will have to consider with coronavirus. \n  Late last month the Cabinet Office set out some basic campaigning rules on areas such as leafleting, and knocking on doors \u2013 both are allowed, but canvassers must give their party\u2019s pitch from 2 metres away, and not go inside. \n  The Electoral Commission document gets into more technical areas, such as whether parties can offer masks and hand sanitiser to people as a way to encourage them to turn out to vote. The short answer is yes, but only if this is \u201cto assist voters generally\u201d, and not to encourage them to vote a certain way, an offence known as \u201ctreating\u201d. \n  If masks or bottles of sanitiser carry a party logo or slogan, they must then also then have the small print you see on election leaflets, stating who has paid for it.  \n  Also, someone wearing a party-logo mask might be asked to change it if they wear it to a polling station, as campaign items are not allowed there. \n  Finally, if parties do decide they want to hand out masks or sanitiser, this counts as election spending, and must be included on their spending return. \n  \n Updated at 2.42pm GMT \n \n \n  2.03pm GMT  \n Government delays introduction of full border checks for EU firms exporting to UK \n  \n  Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has announced that the government is delaying the introduction of many of the checks that will be required for goods coming into the UK from the EU until January next year. In a Commons written statement, he says that phasing in the new rules will take longer than originally planned because of \u201cthe scale and significance of the challenges businesses have been facing in adjusting to the new requirements, at the same time as dealing with the impacts of Covid\u201d. \n  This is a temporary extension of frictionless trade - but one that will benefit EU exports, not UK exports. \n  As the Financial Times\u2019 Peter Foster argues, this will be welcome by firms importing goods from the EU - but not by companies trying to compete against those imports. \n   \n   \n    As anticipated, the UK govt is pushing back by six months the dates at which EU exporters will face full UK border controls. tl;dr relief for supermarkets, less so if you've spent money preparing or are competing against EU exports (like pig farmers). https://t.co/JmX15clqxW pic.twitter.com/Fj1AWvZvlx\u2014 Peter Foster (@pmdfoster) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  And, as the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam points out, the move will help EU traders - without ensuring that the EU offers any reciprocal concessions that might benefit UK firms exporting into Europe. \n   \n   \n    This will come as a huge relief to importing businesses... however some exporting businesses and hauliers were under the impression the threat of reciprocal checks would be used as leverage to get the EU to ease its checks.

This was untrue, as Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, told MPs later, but at the subsequent lobby briefing No 10 refused to directly admit that the PM had made a mistake. \n  This morning Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, said it would be \u201cdishonourable\u201d for Johnson not to correct the record. (See 1.09am.) \n  But now No 10 is saying there is no need to the PM to correct the record - because in fact he was referring to Labour voting against the Queen\u2019s speech, and so he was right all along. Allegra Stratton, the PM\u2019s press secretary, said: \n   \n   The prime minister was referring to Labour voting against the Queen\u2019s speech in January of last year. \n   \n  When it was pointed out that in the Commons yesterday Johnson said that Labour had voted against the \u201cdocument\u201d that Starmer was holding in his hand, Stratton said Labour\u2019s vote against the Queen\u2019s speech was \u201cthe basis\u201d for the point Johnson made. \n  Asked why she had not said this yesterday, she said she had not had time to speak to Johnson between PMQs and the start of yesterday\u2019s lobby briefing. She did not explain why, if Johnson\u2019s account is accurate, there was no attempt to explain that to journalists later in the day. \n  This new line means Johnson won\u2019t be apologising for misleading MPs, or correcting the record, because he has decided he was right all along. \n  It is fair to say not every journalist listening to the call found today\u2019s explanation 100% convincing. Here is some of the reaction. \n  From the Daily Mirror\u2019s Mikey Smith \n   \n   \n    No10 claiming the PM\u2019s false statement about Labour\u2019s voting record yesterday was, in fact, correct, bizarrely claiming he had been \u201creferring to the Queen\u2019s Speech.\u201dThe question was about the NHS Long-term plan. Nobody in the entire of PMQs mentioned the Queen\u2019s Speech.\u2014 Mikey Smith (@mikeysmith) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n   \n   \n    I mean, you don\u2019t want to throw around words like \u2018gaslighting\u2019, but Number 10 apparently inventing justifications for a patently false statement from the PM is pretty worrying.\u2014 Mikey Smith (@mikeysmith) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  From my colleague Peter Walker \n   \n   \n    I hope it's not slipping too much into commentary to say that Stratton's explanation today seems fairly unexpected, somewhat baffling, and extremely unlikely.\u2014 Peter Walker (@peterwalker99) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  From the Independent\u2019s Tom Peck \n   \n   \n    The untelevised lobby briefing is another classic today. Can only imagine some of the \u00a32.6m that\u2019s been spent getting the TV room ready has gone on special paint that will allow them to argue that black is in fact white.\u2014 Tom Peck (@tompeck) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.52pm GMT \n \n \n  1.09pm GMT  \n Speaker says it will be 'dishonourable' if PM keeps refusing to admit he misled MPs \n  \n  Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, has piled pressure on Boris Johnson to correct an untruthful claim made yesterday at PMQs. \n  Johnson left the chamber immediately after his weekly grilling by MPs, so escaped having to hear a complaint made about him for saying Labour voted against the NHS funding bill. \n  At the time shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Johnson should be made to \u201creturn to the house to correct the record\u201d - but Hoyle said by making his intervention, Ashworth had achieved his aim of clarification. \n  Today, no doubt after quite a lot of anger from opposition MPs, Hoyle issued a new statement - saying that the onus is on MPs to \u201ccorrect the record if they make an inaccurate statement to the House\u201d. \n  He cited the ministerial code, which says MPs should \u201ccorrect any inadvertent error at the earliest opportunity\u201d. \n  And he said ministers \u201cmust take responsibility for correcting the record if a mistake has been made\u201d. In a hint that a tougher rebuke might follow if the PM did not admit his mistake, Hoyle added:  \n   \n   It is not dishonourable to make a mistake, but to seek to avoid admitting one is a different matter. \n   \n  No 10 has so far avoided saying why Johnson made the untruthful remark during a lengthy exchange on NHS workers\u2019 pay with Sir Keir Starmer. It has also refused to apologise, or even directly admit that what Johnson said was wrong. \n  Johnson\u2019s press secretary, Allegra Stratton, claimed yesterday that given Hoyle\u2019s response to the complaint made yesterday, the Speaker \u201cregarded it as having been dealt with\u201d. But this morning\u2019s intervention from Hoyle shows that he doesn\u2019t. \n   \n    \n    \n    Sir Lindsay Hoyle. \n    Photograph: UK Parliament/Jessica Taylor/PA \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.53pm GMT  \n Starmer says UK has to 'change to survive' \n  \n  The full text of Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s speech at the Labour campaign launch this morning is here. Afterwards he took a lot of questions from the media \u2013 but managed to sidestep all the tricky ones with such skill that he could qualify to replace Alok Sharma at the Downing Street Covid briefings. \n   \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  (This was frustrating for journalists, but probably not for his press team; party strategists hate it when the headline message from a campaign event gets lost because of a newsy remark in the Q&amp;A.) \n  In so far as what we did learn, here is a summary. \n   \n   Starmer put a demand for a \u201cproper pay rise\u201d for NHS staff at the centre of Labour\u2019s campaign for the May elections. (See 9.16am.) \n   \n   \n   But he declined to back the RCN\u2019s call for nurses to get 12.5% increases. Asked what pay rise NHS staff should be getting, he said: \n   \n   \n    The rise for the NHS front line should be above inflation, a real rise. I think the starting point should be the 2.1% that was promised and was of course budgeted for. \n   \n   \n   He stressed that Labour was now \u201cdifferent\u201d from the party it was before he became leader. (See 9.43am.) \n   \n   \n   He said the United Kingdom had to \u201cchange to survive\u201d. Asked if he agreed with Mark Drakeford, the Labour Welsh first minister who said last week that a new union was needed because the UK \u201cas it is, is over\u201d, Starmer replied: \n   \n   \n   I believe in the United Kingdom and what Mark Drakeford was saying was that he believes in the United Kingdom, but he recognises it\u2019s got to change to survive. And he\u2019s right about that. \n   If the debate anywhere, particularly Scotland, is simply between the status quo and independence, then it\u2019s the wrong debate.  \n   I absolutely want to make a passionate case for the United Kingdom, and a socially just Scotland in a modern United Kingdom. And that\u2019s the message we\u2019ll be carrying to the voters in Scotland this May. \n   \n   \n   Starmer said violence against women was \u201cfar too common\u201d and that this was a particularly important issue for men. At the start of his speech he expressed his sympathy to Sarah Everard\u2019s family and friends and said: \n   \n   \n   This awful news has shaken us all. I\u2019d like to say these incidents are rare, but the truth is that violence against women and girls is far too common. \n   No woman should walk home with fear or threat. \n   And we have to be clear: it\u2019s only by recognising the scale of violence, intimidation and misogyny that women and girls suffer on a daily basis that we can ever start to confront this. \n   \n  Asked what practical measures could be taken to address the problem, Starmer said there was a need for more police officers, and a criminal justice system that worked effectively. But he said a change of thinking was needed too. He said: \n   \n   I\u2019m not sure everyone appreciates how prevalent and pervasive that is ... I think this is particularly an issue for men. It\u2019s very important for men to speak out on this issue. \n   \n   \n   He said that gay conversion practices were \u201cabhorrent\u201d and that Labour would ban them. \u201cWe\u2019re 100% against it,\u201d he said. Commenting on the resignation of two of the government\u2019s LGBT advisers partly over this issue, Starmer said: \n   \n   \n   The government has clearly got a blindspot here. It\u2019s got a problem and the prime minister needs to address it, not least because it\u2019s a pattern of behaviour. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.44pm GMT \n \n \n  12.18pm GMT  \n  \n  A total of 45,229 people tested positive for Covid-19 in England at least once in the week to March 3, according to the latest test and trace figures (pdf).  As PA Media reports, this is down 34% on the previous week and is the lowest number since the week to September 23. \n  \n \n \n  12.11pm GMT  \n  \n  Boris Johnson posted a message on Twitter this morning about the Sarah Everard case. \n   \n   \n    I am shocked and deeply saddened by the developments in the Sarah Everard investigation. Like the whole country my thoughts are with her family and friends. We must work fast to find all the answers to this horrifying crime.\u2014 Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.02pm GMT  \n EU ambassador says UK and Brussels should 'change the mindset' and give up post-Brexit point-scoring \n  \n  The European Union\u2019s ambassador to the UK has called on London and Brussels to \u201cgive up on trying to score points\u201d and ensure there is trust between both sides. At a briefing for Westminster journalists, Joao Vale de Almeida said he wanted there to be the \u201cbest possible relationship\u201d between Britain and the EU post-Brexit amid disputes over trade arrangements. He said: \n   \n   I think we need to make an effort to change the mindset and give up on trying to score points ... and focus ourselves on what we can do for making the most out of the agreements that we made - the withdrawal agreement on one side and the trade and cooperation agreement on the other. \n   With coherence, with consistency and with common willingness to move together ... \n   For all that we need to have high levels of trust - mutual trust. \n   Trust is maybe the most important commodity in international agreements. \n   When there is no trust, when levels of trust go down, you are less capable of finding solutions. \n   \n  \n Updated at 1.07pm GMT \n \n \n  11.39am GMT  \n  \n  Q: Do you agree with Mark Drakeford that the UK union as it is is finished? \n  Starmer says he and Drakeford both believe in the United Kingdom, but they both believe it should change. He says the SNP think the choice is just between the status quo and independence. But that\u2019s the wrong debate, he says. \n  And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A, and the whole event, is over.  \n  It was not exactly a news-rich zone - what was most telling about the Q&amp;A, perhaps, was Starmer\u2019s mastery of the art of dodging the question - but, as always, there were threads of interest. I\u2019ll post a summary soon. \n  \n \n \n  11.32am GMT  \n  \n  Q: In north Wales a health board has gone into special measures. Doesn\u2019t that show Labour can\u2019t deliver on the NHS? \n  Starmer says the Welsh government has shown better leadership duirng the pandemic than Boris Johnson. \n  \n \n \n  11.30am GMT  \n  \n  Q: The Palace issued a statement saying it would take the bullying allegations against Meghan seriously. Shouldn\u2019t they have said the same about the racism allegations? \n  Starmer says he has already addressed this. \n  \n \n \n  11.29am GMT  \n  \n  Q: Should the Palace publish the findings of its inquiry into the Duchess of Sussex\u2019s allegations? \n  Starmer says the royal family has responded. It is a matter for them. But we need to take issues of race and mental health seriously. \n  \n \n \n  11.28am GMT  \n  \n  Q: Would you back nurses going on strike?  \n  Starmer says nurses do not want to have a strike. It is the prime minister who is causing the problem? \n  Q: Should the PM apologise for wrongly saying Labour voted against an NHS pay rise yesterday. \n  Starmer says Boris Johnson should apologise and correct the record. But he never takes responsibility for what he does. \n  \n \n \n  11.25am GMT  \n  \n  Q: Do you agree with the government LGBT advisers who resigned partly over gay conversion therapy? \n  Starmer says gay conversion theraphy is abhorrent. Labour would ban it. He says he thinks the government has a blind spot on this issue. \n  \n \n \n  11.23am GMT  \n  \n  Q: What can be done to make women safer? \n  Starmer says, first, we need to recognise the scale of the problem. Then we need to tackle it. We need to challenge unacceptable behaviours. And we need more police officers, he says. \n  Q: What would success for Labour look like? \n  Starmer says the party will campaign hard. But it is tough. We are in a pandemic, he says, and the party is constrained by what it can do in terms of campaigning. \n  Q: Do you expect to see gains in England, Scotland and Wales? \n  Starmer says the party will fight hard in England, Scotland and Wales. \n  \n \n \n  11.21am GMT  \n Starmer's Q&amp;A \n  \n  Starmer is now taking questions. \n  Q: What practical difference would it make having a Labour councillor? \n  Starmer says people should look at the record of Labour councils. He cites Andy Burnham as an example of a leader standing up for his communities. \n  Q: Don\u2019t you need to be making real progress in these elections? \n  Starmer says it will be tough. He says, as Labour leader, he has still not had the chance to give a speech to a live audience. \n  \n \n \n  11.18am GMT  \n  \n  Starmer turns to Scotland. \n   \n   In Scotland, the SNP are fighting among themselves rather than fighting for the Scottish people. \n   Their 13 years in power has seen child poverty rise and educational standards fall. \n   Scotland now has the lowest life expectancy in Western Europe and the highest number of drug deaths. \n   That\u2019s a record of shame. \n   And what\u2019s the SNP\u2019s priority? Another divisive referendum. \n    Under our brilliant new leader \u2013 Anas Sarwar - Labour will focus on what unites Scotland, not what divides us. \n   \n  And, on Wales, he praises Mark Drakeford, the first minister, for the showing the \u201cleadership that\u2019s been sorely lacking from Boris Johnson\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  11.16am GMT  \n  \n  There are elections for police and crime commissioners in May, and Starmer reminds the audience he was director of public prosecutions for five years. \n   \n   That meant working with the police across the country day in, day out. \n   So I know first-hand that it\u2019s only by tackling the causes of crime that we can have safer neighbourhoods and fewer victims. \n   Labour\u2019s police and crime commissioners will have one central focus: the safety of all our local communities. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.15am GMT  \n  \n  Starmer is now repeating the line he used at PMQs yesterday about how his mother and sister worked as nurses, and how his wife works for the NHS. \u201cWhen I clapped for our carers, I meant it,\u201d he says. \n  He says these elections are a chance for people to show they care for the NHS. \n  He goes on: \n   \n   This election is also a chance to vote against the Conservatives\u2019 tax rises on families \u2013 which will take money out of people\u2019s pockets at the worst possible time. \n   The Conservatives fought the last election with a tax guarantee: the only guarantee now is that families will pay more tax. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.10am GMT  \n  \n  Starmer says the country faces a choice - change, or go back to more of the same. \n  And he says the Tories must be judged by what they do. \n   \n   There\u2019s one thing we know about the Conservatives: Don\u2019t listen to what they say, watch what they do. \n   A pay cut for nurses - and tax rises for families. \n   Nothing for social care. \n   No plan to cut NHS waiting lists. \n   And no idea how to tackle the single biggest threat Britain faces: the climate emergency. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.09am GMT  \n  \n  Starmer says the extraordinary achievements of the NHS in rolling out the vaccine should not blind us to the mistakes made earlier. \n   \n   The Conservatives were too slow to lockdown. \n   Too slow to protect care homes. \n   Too slow to get protective equipment to the frontline. \n   And too stubborn to sack Dominic Cummings when he broke the rules. \n   A decade of Conservative government left Britain unprepared going into the pandemic. \n   And they\u2019ve now they\u2019ve left us with the highest death toll in Europe - and the worst economic crisis of any major economy. \n   After everything we\u2019ve been through, we can\u2019t go back to business as usual. \n   \n  \n \n \n  11.07am GMT  \n  \n  Starmer says he is glad to be out campaigning. \n  He praises Labour figures who have stood up for their communities. \n  And Labour councils across the country stepped up when the Conservative government refused to provide free school meals, he says. \n  \n \n \n  11.05am GMT  \n Keir Starmer's speech at Labour launch \n  \n  Sir Keir Starmer is starting his speech, and he begins by expressing his sympathy to the family and friends of Sarah Everard. He would like to say events like this are rare, he says. But he says violence against women is still all too common. \n  \n \n \n  11.02am GMT  \n 44% of NHS staff in England felt unwell from work-related stress in 2020, survey shows \n  \n  More than four-in-10 NHS staff in England said they felt unwell as a result of work-related stress in 2020, PA Media reports. PA says: \n   \n   The NHS Staff Survey 2020 (pdf), published on this morning, found that 44% of staff had reported feeling unwell as a result of work-related stress in the previous 12 months, up from 40% the previous year. \n   The survey found that the increases were steepest in acute and community trusts and acute specialist trusts. \n   Some 595,270 NHS employees in England responded to the survey, which was carried out between September and December last year. \n   It also found that 46% of staff said they have gone to work in the last three months, despite not feeling well enough to perform their duties, a drop from 57% in 2019. \n   Almost a fifth of staff are considering leaving the NHS - although this has fallen slightly since 2019, from 19.6% to 18.2%, according to the survey. \n   It includes people considering retiring or taking a career break and those considering moving to a job outside healthcare or in healthcare but outside the NHS. \n   \n   \n    \n    \n    Extract from staff survey summary \n    Photograph: NHS Staff Survey \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.50am GMT  \n  \n  The online Labour campaign launch is now showing a video message about postal voting. Sir Keir Starmer is speaking at 11.05am. After his speech he will be doing a Q&amp;A. \n  \n \n \n  10.49am GMT  \n Polls suggest support for SNP in Scotland has slipped back \n  \n  Two new opinion polls show that Scotland\u2019s opposition parties are gaining ground against Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s Scottish National party, eight weeks before the Holyrood election, with SNP support slipping again. \n  The YouGov poll for the Times and SavantaComres for the Scotsman raise questions whether Sturgeon will win an outright Holyrood majority on May 6, dampening her claims to have a mandate to hold a second independence referendum. \n  After months of dominance in the polls for Sturgeon and the SNP, alongside a record 58% high in support for independence, the polls also confirmed a downward slide in backing for independence. \n  YouGov put the yes vote at 49% and no at 51%, excluding don\u2019t knows, reversing its finding in November 2020. SavantaComres had the same result. YouGov also found fewer voters believed a referendum should be held this year if the SNP won a majority; 50% of voters now oppose that idea, compared to 44% in November. \n  The polls were published as Keir Starmer launches Labour\u2019s local elections campaign with a pan-GB approach on Thursday morning. It features Anas Sarwar, the new Scottish Labour leader, and Welsh Labour first minister Mark Drakeford - the first time Labour\u2019s three party leaders have jointly staged a local elections launch. \n  SavanaComres found the SNP constituency vote down 6 points to 48 since February - making a majority unlikely, with the Tories still at 23%, and Labour up 4 points to 20%. YouGov found SNP down 4 points since November to 52%, with the Tories up 3 to 22%, and Labour up 2 to 15%. Polling on both stradled last weekend, when Sarwar was elected the new Scottish Labour leader. \n  The SNP\u2019s slump is put down to the bitter public feud between Alex Salmond and his successor Nicola Sturgeon over the sexual assault allegations (of which he has been cleared), which has erupted into life with both giving evidence to a Holyrood inquiry. \n  Opposition parties also believe the success of the UK-wide vaccinations programme has increased support for the union, and to a lesser degree, the Tories. \n  It\u2019s far from clear those factors will continue to influence voters once election campaigns begin in earnest in early April, when the SNP\u2019s formidable campaigning machine gets into gear and it starts reminding voters of the heavy impacts of Brexit. \n  \n \n \n  10.44am GMT  \n  \n  Sadiq Khan, the Labour mayor of London, is speaking now at the Labour launch. He says he has achieved a lot as mayor, including reducing toxic air pollution by more than a third, investing \u00a370m in youth projects, and starting to build more council homes than in any year since 1983. But he can do more to make London greener and better, he says. \n  \n Updated at 10.51am GMT \n \n \n  10.41am GMT  \n  \n  The Labour election launch has started.

He said he wanted people to know that the party was on their side. \n  Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, is speaking now. \n  He says Wales has extraordinary capacities, \u201cnot just to match other countries but to show them the way\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  10.25am GMT  \n Momentum criticises Labour for refusing to back call for 12% pay rise for nurses \n  \n  Angela Rayner, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, was giving interviews this morning and, when asked what pay rise NHS staff should be getting this year, she said it should be the 2.1% originally budgeted for by the government \u201cat the very least\u201d. \n  She would not endorse the proposal from the Royal College of Nursig for nurses to get a 12% pay rise. And she would not repeat the call in Labour\u2019s 2019 manifesto for nurses to get 5%. Asked about that pledge, she said: \n   \n   We\u2019ve got to remind ourselves, that manifesto in 2019, the general public completely rejected it. It was one of our worst election defeats. \n   \n  Momentum, the Labour group set up to champion Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s politics when he was leader, accused the party of failing to stand up for working people. A Momentum spokesperson said: \n   \n   In the context of a 10% real terms pay cut since 2010, this refusal to back our nurses unions and their reasonable demand for a 12% rise is embarrassing. \n   \u2018This leadership is developing a reputation. First they sold out the teachers, now they sell out the nurses - who\u2019s next? It\u2019s time for the Labour party to pick a side, and stand up for working people.  \n   \n   \n   \n    \u201cThe government should give the 2.1% rise that they promised\u201d Deputy Leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner speaks to #BBCBreakfast about the government\u2019s proposed 1% pay rise for NHS staff in England \u2935\ufe0fhttps://t.co/CiQ6YhBpK8 pic.twitter.com/FoBYkHFXSn\u2014 BBC Breakfast (@BBCBreakfast) \n    March 11, 2021\n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.14am GMT  \n 4.59m people in England waiting for hospital treatment in January, NHS figures show \n  \n  The number of people in England waiting to start hospital treatment has risen to a new record high, PA Media reports.

They show: \n   \n   81% of disabled people said they were worried about the impact the pandemic was having on their life, compared to 72% of non-disabled people. \n   \n   \n   Two thirds (67%) of disabled people said the pandemic was affecting their well-being, compared to 53% of non-disabled people. \n   \n   \n   Nearly a third (32%) of disabled people said the pandemic was affecting their health, compared to 12% of non-disabled people. \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.55am GMT  \n Cancer patients not properly protected after single dose of Pfizer vaccine, researchers claim \n  \n  Delaying the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine must be urgently reviewed for cancer patients after a single shot was found to offer inadequate protection, researchers have said. In its report PA Media says: \n   \n   A study from King\u2019s College London and the Francis Crick Institute - which has not yet been peer-reviewed - found that three weeks after the first jab, antibody responses were found in 39% of people with solid cancers and 13% of people with blood cancer. \n   This compared with 97% of people with no cancer, according to the research on 205 people, who comprised 151 with cancer and 54 healthy controls. \n   Cancer patients given a second dose of the vaccine three weeks after the first - as recommended by Pfizer - had a much better immune response, with 95% of those with solid tumours showing detectable antibodies. \n   The team said leaving up to a 12-week gap between doses - as is currently happening in the UK - is leaving cancer patients vulnerable to serious Covid-19. \n   However, Cancer Research UK said the study was relatively small and people should continue to follow the advice of their doctors. \n   \n  Dr Sheeba Irshad, senior clinical lecturer from King\u2019s College London, said:  \n   \n   Our data provides the first real-world evidence of immune efficacy following one dose of the Pfizer vaccine in immunocompromised patient populations. \n   We show that following first dose, most solid and haematological [blood] cancer patients remained immunologically unprotected up until at least five weeks following primary injection; but this poor one-dose efficacy can be rescued with an early booster (second dose) at day 21. \n   Based on our findings, we would recommend an urgent review of the vaccine strategy for clinically extremely vulnerable groups. \n   Until then, it is important that cancer patients continue to observe all public health measures in place such as social distancing and shielding when attending hospitals, even after vaccination. \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.50am GMT  \n  \n  And this is what the Conservative party said in its response to the comments from Sir Keir Starmer released ahead of the Labour campaign launch. (See 9.16am and 9.43am.) Amanda Milling, the Conservative co-chairman, said: \n   \n   Up and down the country Labour are failing to deliver locally. \n   Labour politicians are distracted from delivering on your priorities and more interested in playing political games than delivering good services. \n   Only the Conservatives can be trusted to focus on your priorities with a proven record of keeping bills down and providing better local services. \n   \n  In a briefing note the Conservatives said that in 2020-21 the average band D council tax under a Conservative council in England was \u00a383 a year lower than under a Labour council, and \u00a3130 a year lower than under a Lib Dem council. They also claimed Labour councils \u201cspend longer on scoring political points and deciding which statutes they want to tear down than how to make sure people\u2019s bins are emptied and their potholes are filled\u201d. \n  \n \n \n  9.43am GMT  \n Starmer says he's leading 'different Labour party' \n  \n  In his speech at the Labour campaign launch Sir Keir Starmer will also stress that Labour has changed under his leadership. According to the extracts released overnight, he will say: \n   \n   Since Angela [Rayner, the deputy leader] and I were elected eleven months ago, Labour\u2019s changed. We\u2019re reconnecting with the British people \u2013 in every region and nation of the United Kingdom and we\u2019re working hard to rebuild trust. \n   There\u2019s a long way to go but I\u2019m incredibly proud of what we\u2019ve achieved. Whether that\u2019s rooting out the antisemitism that had poisoned this party or rebuilding our relationship with British business. \n   This is a different Labour party, under new leadership and we\u2019re making a different offer to the British people. \n   \n  \n \n \n  9.16am GMT  \n Starmer demands 'proper pay rise' for NHS as he launches Labour's campaign for May elections \n  \n  Good morning. What one might call \u201cnormal politics\u201d has been relatively marginalised in the last year because of the pandemic. (That may in part help to explain why last week marked the moment when 582 days had passed since the last Westminster byelection, a post-war record, although, as PA\u2019s Ian Jones explains here, other factors are much more relevant.) But today we\u2019re going to nudge a bit closer to business as usual when Labour launches its campaign for the May elections. \n  According to extracts from his speech released overnight, Sir Keir Starmer is going to going to put a call for nurses to get more than the 1% pay rise proposed by the government at the heart of his party\u2019s campaign. He will say: \n   \n   Under my leadership, and with our great local candidates across the country, Labour offers a very different route to recovery. Labour\u2019s changing. Our priorities are your priorities: securing the economy, protecting the NHS, rebuilding Britain. \n   So, if you want to support our nurses. To rebuild social care. And to reward our key workers, then vote Labour. My mum was a nurse, my sister was a nurse, my wife works for the NHS. \n   I know how tough this year has been for our NHS and I know that now, more than ever, is the time to give our key workers a proper pay rise. \n   Every vote in this election is a chance to show the Conservatives that the British people value our NHS and our key workers so much more than this government does. \n   \n  There is one obvious problem with this approach. The elections in England, for councillors, city and metro mayors, police commissioners and members of the London assembly, will have no direct bearing whatsoever on nurses\u2019 pay. Labour could win every contest and still not be confident of reversing the proposed pay rise. (There are also elections in May to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments.) \n  But, in practice, many voters tend not to be over-focused on the accountability boundaries relating to public sector pay, but they do respond to a message with obvious emotional appeal. And the strength of Labour\u2019s case was highlighted last night when Caroline Nokes, a Conservative former minister and chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, told ITV\u2019s Peston that 1% was stunningly low. She said: \n   \n   It\u2019s a very bad look for the government, and as I say I was stunned that it was as low as one percent. \n   \n  (This highlights a second problem with Labour\u2019s decision to choose nurses\u2019 pay as a campaign theme. By election day on 6 May, Boris Johnson may well have increased NHS pay anyway. Nokes told Peston: \u201cI think we will see it go upwards, it\u2019s just a question of how much.\u201d) \n  Here is the agenda for the day. \n  9.30am: The ONS publishes reports on the impact of Covid on the economy, and its impact on disabled people.  \n  9.30am: NHS England publishes its annual staff survey, as well as monthly waiting time figures. \n  10.30am: Sir Keir Starmer launches Labour\u2019s campaign for the local elections. \n  11am: NHS test and trace publishes its weekly performance figures. \n  12pm: Downing Street is expected to hold its daily lobby briefing. \n  12.30pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, takes questions in the Scottish parliament. \n  2pm: Public Health England publishes its weekly Covid surveillance report. \n  2.30pm: Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, gives evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the budget. \n  Politics Live is now doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog but we are covering non-Covid political stories too, like Labour\u2019s local election launch, and when they seem more important or more interesting, they will take precedence. \n  Here is our global coronavirus live blog. \n   \n    Related: Coronavirus live news: Brazil daily death toll passes 2,000 for first time; Cambodia records first Covid fatality  \n   \n  I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all.

A group of 100 London health professionals who work in the NHS have backed the call for action with a letter to the capital\u2019s mayoral candidates, urging them to commit to tackling air pollution inequalities and to develop an \u201curgent action plan to \u2026 reduce our dependence on cars\u201d.

Children and unborn babies may suffer the most.     Air pollution disproportionately affects minority ethnic communities, campaigners say. Photograph: Choked Up    The EDF study highlighted the uneven impact of air pollution, with nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 24-31% higher in areas of London where people from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds are most likely to live. Additionally, it found the most deprived Londoners are more than six times more likely to live in areas with higher pollution than the least deprived.

I don\u2019t let it stop me but I\u2019m very aware of every person, movement and what could happen. I don\u2019t relax until I reach my destination. \u201cMy dad took me for self-defence lessons as a teenager and I still remember much of the advice. It runs through my mind every time I walk somewhere alone at night.  \u201cI always walk with my keys in my hand, the \u2018blade\u2019 of a key sticking out so that I can use them as a weapon. I don\u2019t think any of this would stop anything from happening, but I feel more assured having some self-defence skills. \u201cI\u2019ve lived all over the country: in Hackney, before it was gentrified, in Yorkshire, rural Derbyshire and now in the suburbs of Nottingham. I\u2019ve always felt the same though, in all of these places.

I\u2019ve had people suggest using a taxi, like it\u2019s a whole lot safer, but there have been reports of taxi-drivers taking advantage of passengers, like John Worboys, and recent concerns over fake Ubers and such. \u201cEven if you\u2019re with another female friend, you think it might not be enough to deter attackers. Commuting in the dark during the winter months, especially during lockdown. feels particularly dangerous.  \u201cI was commuting into work when I was approached by a man and asked for my phone number. When I declined, he would not leave me alone and followed me on my route into work.  \u201cThere was no one around, it was dark, he was a lot bigger than me and walked pretty close to me despite social distancing. I was really scared for my own safety.  \u201cIn the end, the only way I could get rid of him was by giving him fake details and making a run for it. I was paranoid for months about bumping into him again and changed my commute routine. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for women. You\u2019re told to be polite and smile and be nice even if you\u2019re feeling threatened.

You simultaneously wish for someone to appear to protect you, but are incredibly fearful that if a person appears they might harm you.  \u201cYou walk quickly and alertly, looking around every few seconds to check no one is following you. Any rustling, footsteps, or lone cars can create that adrenaline rush of fear. You push out the thoughts of the worst thing that could happen to you, and concentrate on it being a safe part of the city \u2013 many women have safely walked here before and will do so after you. \u201cI tend to phone my boyfriend, or a friend, and have them chat to me on any stretch of dark road. My boyfriend will also often meet me at a bus stop if I am heading home. \u201cI will survey every street and individual before deciding where to go next, and I will stick mainly to well-lit and busy areas.

During lockdown, I\u2019ve steeled myself to take more walks alone during the day but \u2013 whether it\u2019s along the river, in a nature reserve or just in the park \u2013 that anxiety is always there. I am always alert to any man who is walking behind me, past me or towards me. \u201cWalking alone at night, even in a relatively busy city centre, is something I would try never to do, although during the winter it\u2019s often impossible to avoid when it\u2019s dark around 4pm.  \u201cMaybe my fears are a reaction to growing up in Yorkshire during the [Peter] Sutcliffe years. But those fears are real.  \u201cIt\u2019s important to be alert, listen and not wear heels so I can run if necessary.

However, now I\u2019ve come to feel the fear first-hand.  \u201cIt\u2019s the everyday things women go through that breeds this fear of being alone at night \u2013 catcalls on the street, men twice my age staring, vulgar comments at the pub with my friends. These are things that every woman has experienced, and so, when it comes to being alone in a public space at night, I\u2019ve found I\u2019m naturally more fearful. \u201cJust the thought of walking past a group of men at night is enough to have my heart beating. The sudden realisation of a new shadow in front of me at night has me spinning around \u2013 prepared for the worst \u2013 only to find it\u2019s the shadow of the lamp-post above me. \u201cOccasionally, I might put my earphones in and play loud music, or a podcast to distract myself.

The Scottish and Welsh parliamentary elections \u2013 along with the English mayoral and local elections \u2013 aren\u2019t happening until 6 May but, for reasons best known to themselves, Labour reckoned that early March was the ideal time to start its campaign. Judging by the hourlong launch event, they might be pushing their luck to keep people interested for the best part of two months. \nThe show opened with the deputy leader, Angela Rayner, introducing various videos. First an old black and white clip of a steam train with a shoutout to Harold Wilson \u2013 not sure how much name recognition he will get among younger voters \u2013 then clips of the new Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and several other candidates. The Welsh clip started as a tourist promotional film of the coastal path, complete with melancholy piano soundtrack, and ended with an appearance from the first minister, Mark Drakeford. \nRayner tried to sound enthusiastic as she linked the videos, but by the time she had been forced to present the same two postal vote films three or four times each to fill up the dead air, even she had begun to flag somewhat. Her relief when she was allowed to hand over to Keir Starmer, who was giving a live speech from a makeshift studio somewhere in London, was tangible. \n\u201cAfter 11 months of talking on Zoom, I\u2019m looking forward to getting out and meeting people,\u201d Starmer said. Just who the Labour leader was expecting to meet was another matter entirely as campaign rallies don\u2019t really square with the government\u2019s roadmap out of lockdown. Unless he is planning to meet the entire country in groups of six come the end of the month. \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nAs expected, Starmer went in hard on the Tories\u2019 pay cut for nurses \u2013 he even repeated several of his better lines from the previous day\u2019s prime minister\u2019s questions. I suspect we are going to hear quite a lot about how his mother and sister were both nurses and how his wife works for the NHS in the coming weeks. Though he may need to have a plan B in case Boris Johnson caves in \u2013 as many believe he will \u2013 and offers nurses an above-inflation pay increase. \nThe Labour leader also tried to remind everyone who was watching \u2013 so probably just a few hundred people then, though considerably more than had tuned into the Tory London mayoral hopeful Shaun Bailey\u2019s dismal event earlier in the day \u2013 just how badly Johnson had screwed up in the first nine months of his coronavirus response. But Starmer\u2019s heart didn\u2019t really appear to be fully engaged in his speech. Not that he didn\u2019t believe what he was saying, rather that he knew it was going to be an uphill struggle to keep people focused on the elections now that the vaccine programme was proving unexpectedly successful. Everyone had just about had enough and could do with a break from politics. \nNor did the questions from the media prove particularly revealing. Other than to highlight that Starmer is just as accomplished at not providing answers when the situation suits him. So we got nothing on the ongoing Harry and Meghan row \u2013 William has declared that, on reflection, the royal family isn\u2019t racist, so that\u2019s all sorted then \u2013 or on whether he would join nurses on a picket line if they went on strike. Starmer was equally cagey about what would constitute a fair pay rise, saying only that the 2.1% that had been previously agreed and budgeted for would be a good starting point. \n \n  Related: Boris Johnson resists calls to correct claim in NHS pay row  \n \n\u201cAnd the final question is from Peter at the Express and Star,\u201d the Labour leader said. Except there was no sign of Peter, who had vanished from his screen. Presumably because he had realised there was little prospect of getting any kind of meaningful response. Starmer looked as relieved as the rest of us felt. Perhaps it was slowly dawning on him that two months of campaigning might just be at least a month too much. \nBack in the Commons, the main focus of attention was on the Speaker. Fair to say that opposition MPs have been disappointed in Lindsay Hoyle\u2019s indulgence of Johnson over the past year or so, and his reluctance to hold the prime minister to account over his false accusations that Labour had voted against the nurses\u2019 pay rise after the previous day\u2019s PMQs was apparently just the latest sign of weakness. But overnight Hoyle appeared to have had a change of heart as, just before business questions, he made a statement saying ministers should come to the Commons to apologise if they have misled the house. \nNot that there seems much chance of that happening as Allegra Stratton, the prime minister\u2019s press secretary, was already in the process of embarrassing herself by trying to claim that Johnson had not been referring to the bill that everyone who had heard him had assumed he was. Black was white. It was both absurd and pointless. Though no one should be too surprised by Johnson\u2019s refusal to apologise.

Speaking in the presence of journalists and Caruana Galizia\u2019s relatives in hall 22 of the law courts in Malta\u2019s capital, Valletta, Vincent Muscat gave the fullest account yet of the plot to murder the journalist. Caruana Galizia\u2019s death in October 2017 was met with outrage across Europe, and embroiled Malta\u2019s ruling Labour party in a political scandal that led to the resignation of the prime minister in 2019. Seven men have either admitted to or been charged with complicity in the killing. They include the property and energy tycoon Yorgen Fenech, who has pleaded not guilty to masterminding the murder, and Melvin Theuma, a taxi-driver who confessed to being the middleman in the alleged contract killing. Muscat, who like Theuma has turned state witness, said he met two other men accused of direct involvement in the murder, the brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, before Malta\u2019s June 2017 general election. \u201cAlfred Degiorgio came to me and told me there was a good job for me,\u201d he told the court on Thursday, in remarks reported by Malta Today, which was following the hearing from the courtroom. He said the job was to kill Caruana Galizia and that a price of \u20ac150,000 had been agreed. \u201cThe plan was to follow her steps and shoot her when the time was right. After the election, Theuma gave us the go-ahead. He gave us a \u20ac30,000 advance in a brown leather bag. The sum was paid in \u20ac50 notes. We took \u20ac10,000 each and started work. Alfred and I followed her to Bidnija,\u201d the village where Caruana Galizia lived. He said the three of them used binoculars and a telescope to observe Caruana Galizia\u2019s movements closely, and they spent whole days watching her.  \u201cWe\u2019d be sitting there on two bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was uncomfortable and you\u2019d get sore \u2026 I was buying three packs of Rothmans Red [cigarettes] a day. We disposed of the butts in a water bottle, so as not to leave any trace. We watched Daphne on her sofa with a laptop until 2am.\u201d Muscat said the original plan was to shoot Caruana Galizia in her home: \u201cThe plan was to have Alfred shoot from under the tree. I would take him away from the scene in a stolen car \u2026 George started coming up with excuses [such as] the rifle was too noisy.\u201d The shooting plan was eventually abandoned and the men opted to use a bomb instead. \u201cGeorge Degiorgio always wanted a bomb \u2026 a bomb you place it at night and you leave. Quieter, less panic.\u201d He said the men began to discuss obtaining a bomb from Jamie Vella, who pleaded not guilty last month to complicity in the killing.  Muscat said the bomb had a stainless steel face and an apparatus in which the sim card would be inserted. \u201cYou send a particular message to the sim card on the bomb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would explode seconds later.\u201d In one particularly shocking moment in court, Muscat said he had told his alleged accomplices that he was worried that a car bomb might end up killing other people, and that they replied \u201cwe\u2019ll go ahead, even if others are with her in the car\u201d. While keeping watch over Caruana Galizia\u2019s house, they noticed on the night of 15 October 2017 that, unusually, she had parked her car outside the gate of her home.  Muscat said he picked up the bomb, which was hidden in a shoebox, and met up with the other hitmen. They then placed the device beneath the driver\u2019s seat. At 5am the next morning, Muscat and Alfred Degiorgio returned to a vantage point overlooking the house. In the early afternoon they saw Caruana Galizia drive off and informed George Degiorgio, who was in a boat, ready to trigger the bomb remotely. He detonated the bomb before his brother had given him the go-ahead. Caruana Galizia\u2019s car was out of sight and Muscat said they did not hear the explosion, but they looked back and saw a plume of smoke. Muscat also reiterated claims he has previously made to police that he drove Alfred Degiorgio to meet the former economy minister Chris Cardona in Valletta in the run-up to the murder, and that Cardona allegedly tipped off the men before they were arrested in December 2017. Cardona told the Malta Independent that Muscat\u2019s claims were \u201ccraziness and blatant lies\u201d. \u201cI was never aware of any project to kill anyone,\u201d Cardona said. \u201cThis is pure evil fiction.\u201d Before the hearing, Muscat apologised to the family of Caruana Galizia \u2013 a columnist and investigator whose blog on political corruption earned her a reputation as a \u201cone-woman WikiLeaks\u201d.  Theuma was granted a pardon in November 2019 to reveal what he knew about the murder and is living in a safe house. His evidence implicated Fenech, who was arrested in 2019 as he was attempting to leave Malta on his yacht. Fenech is in custody awaiting a decision on whether he will face trial.

The Bradford-based company\u2019s annual pre-tax profit before one-offs fell to \u00a3201m on sales of \u00a317.5bn.  David Potts, Morrisons\u2019 chief executive, pointed to \u00a3290m of costs stemming from the pandemic, including covering for worker absence and paying store staff a bonus, coupled with the decision to return \u00a3230m of business rates relief. \u201cI personally wear the halving of profits as a badge of honour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing being asked to keep indoors for most of the year, it is quite another if you haven\u2019t got access to food. \u201cOf course the British people have had access to food because supermarket workers were asked by government to be key workers and [stores] required to stay open unlike pretty much the rest of society.

Online sales tripled during the year, and capacity was up fivefold.

Members of the Amazon Prime subscription service can buy Morrisons groceries through Amazon\u2019s website for same-day delivery, with orders picked from the shelves of its nearby supermarkets. The service has reached 50 towns and cities, with the orders often making up more than 10% of a participating store\u2019s sales, it said. Morrisons, which is viewed as a potential acquisition target for Amazon, is supplying the Amazon Fresh grocery store, which opened in London last week. Despite winning customer loyalty with its efforts during the pandemic, including food bank donations and food box deliveries, the company is unloved by the City.

The supermarket told analysts that this year\u2019s profits would be higher than the \u00a3431m it would have banked had it not waived rates relief.

Andrew Opie, Director of Food &amp; Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said the move came \u2018in the nick of time\u2019  \u201cWe are pleased that the Government has listened to us and postponed border checks until the systems and border posts are ready. With many of the key Border Control Posts currently little more than a hole in the ground, the six month easement comes in the nick of time. Until the infrastructure is in place, with IT systems ready and established processes for checks and paperwork, it would be foolhardy to introduce full requirements for EHC documentation, pre-notification of imports, physical checks and more. We welcome the Government\u2019s decision, which will ultimately reduce the impact on consumers from the 1st April, who might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products. Government must not rest on its laurels, and the next six months must be used to establish and communicate the new systems with UK retailers and EU suppliers.\u201d  Adam Marshall, Director General of the BCC, also welcomed the move, but also warns that other problems in the Brexit deal need to be addressed [these delays only help firms importing from Europe, not exporting to Europe, of course]  Marshall says:   \u201cThis is a positive step as it recognises what everyone in business has known for weeks now: UK-EU trade has faced, and continues to face, significant disruption and difficulty.  \u201cMinisters are right to delay the implementation of import checks that would slow trade even further - but this can only be a temporary solution.  What businesses want to see is an end to the damaging political rhetoric from both sides, and a focus on improving border flow for the long term. The UK and the EU must get back around the table and thrash out the remaining structural problems in the Trade and Co-operation Agreement.  \u201cFor some UK firms, the continued problems with EU trade are threatening their very existence. It should not be the case that companies simply have to give up on importing from, or exporting to, the market next door.\u201d      Updated at 2.47pm GMT     2.26pm GMT       Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has confirmed that the UK is delaying imposing post-Brexit checks on imports from the EU. Gove says that the government has listened to businesses:   We know now that the disruption caused by COVID has lasted longer and has been deeper than we anticipated. Accordingly, the Government has reviewed these timeframes. Although we recognise that many in the border industry and many businesses have been investing time and energy to be ready on time, and indeed we in Government were confident of being ready on time, we have listened to businesses who have made a strong case that they need more time to prepare.  As we flagged earlier, customs &amp; sanitary checks are delayed until January, while other paperwork such as animal health certificates now won\u2019t be needed until this October.  Here are the new dates:  Pre-notification requirements for Products of Animal Origin (POAO), certain animal by-products (ABP), and High Risk Food Not Of Animal Origin (HRFNAO) will not be required until 1 October 2021. Export Health Certificate requirements for POAO and certain ABP will come into force on the same date. Customs import declarations will still be required, but the option to use the deferred declaration scheme, including submitting supplementary declarations up to six months after the goods have been imported, has been extended to 1 January 2022. Safety and Security Declarations for imports will not be required until 1 January 2022. Physical SPS checks for POAO, certain ABP, and HRFNAO will not be required until 1 January 2022. At that point they will take place at Border Control Posts. Physical SPS checks on high risk plants will take place at Border Control Posts, rather than at the place of destination as now, from 1 January 2022. Pre-notification requirements and documentary checks, including phytosanitary certificates will be required for low risk plants and plant products, and will be introduced from 1 January 2022. From March 2022, checks at Border Control Posts will take place on live animals and low risk plants and plant products.  And here\u2019s some early reaction, from the BBC\u2019s Faisal Islam:    This will come as a huge relief to importing businesses... however some exporting businesses and hauliers were under the impression the threat of reciprocal checks would be used as leverage to get the EU to ease its checks.

The National Farmers Union (NFU) is warning that livestock trades could grind to a halt, because no Channel port is planning facilities to check incoming farm animals. And the location of some inland border checkpoints \u2013 such as Holyhead on Anglesey and in south-west Wales to serve the ports of Fishguard and Pembroke \u2013 has not even been announced yet, while the Kent site named White Cliffs, where goods arriving at Dover will be inspected, is described as a \u201cmuddy field\u201d.        2.02pm GMT    UK to delay customs &amp; sanitary import checks from EU    Breaking away from the European Central Bank, the UK is going to delay the introduction of customs &amp; sanitary (SPS) import checks on EU goods at the border for six months, to 1st January 2022. My colleague Joanna Partridge has the details:     I understand the Cabinet Office is due to announce shortly that the introduction of customs &amp; sanitary (SPS) import checks at the border is being pushed back by 6 months to 1 Jan 2022 as border infrastructure won\u2019t be ready on time - as we reported here https://t.co/wVD8bp0tyW&mdash; Joanna Partridge (@JoannaPartridge) March 11, 2021    This moves follows pressure from British ports for a delay, as border checkposts will not be ready for the July deadline, and the construction of inland customs facilities is also behind schedule.

Those checks are due to take place at more than 30 designated border control posts (BCPs), where goods, plants and animals entering from the EU by sea, rail or air can be inspected.

She then confirms that the ECB is speeding up the pace of its pandemic bond-buying programme (as announced earlier).       1.41pm GMT       On inflation, Christine Lagarde says underlying pressures remain subdued, with the overall inflation outlook broadly unchanged.       1.38pm GMT    Lagarde: High Covid-19 infection rates, mutations and lockdowns are hurting growth    European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde is holding a press conference now to explain today\u2019s decisions. Lagarde says the overall economic situation is expected to improve over 2021. But, there remains uncertainty over the near-term economic outlook, relating in particular to the dynamics of the pandemic, and the speed of vaccination campaigns, she says. Persistently high rates of coronavirus infections, the spread of virus mutations, and the associated extension and tightening of containment measures are weighing on the eurozone economy in the short term, she adds.       1.32pm GMT       Here\u2019s Vuk Magdelinic, CEO of AI quantitative analytics provider Overbond, on the ECB\u2019s move:   \u201cLagarde has certainly learned her lesson from a year ago. Looking ahead, it\u2019s clear that rising government bond yields are seen as a threat to a still-weak European economy, with the steps outlined today clearly designed to keep yields down and provide assurance. While longer dated yields have been leading the curve higher and steeper, the hope for now is that European yields across all tenors will see some semblance of stability, as has been apparent thus far this week in the US. \u201cLooking at Overbond\u2019s COBI-pricing data for credit markets in the region, spreads in all but the BB sector appear reasonably well-behaved, with 10 year BB spreads increasing by 27 bps compared to 4bps for BBB and 3bps for A and AA. Corporate yields currently more or less match the increase in benchmark government yields for the region, and with the economy facing an uncertain outlook, the ECB\u2019s stance on government bonds should keep a lid on major yield moves in credit markets.\u201d        1.29pm GMT       Eurozone bond yields have tumbled after the ECB said it would accelerate the pace of its bond buying pandemic stimulus over the next three months.

Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Reuters    In other retail news, Morrisons\u2019 profits for 2020 slumped by half, which the supermarket\u2019s chief executive described as a badge of honour. Earnings were hit by the extra costs incurred in \u201cfeeding the nation\u201d during the coronavirus crisis, which cancelled out the benefits of higher sales. The Bradford-based company\u2019s annual pre-tax profit before one-offs fell to \u00a3201m on sales of \u00a317.5bn. David Potts, Morrisons chief executive, pointed to \u00a3290m of costs stemming from the pandemic, including covering for worker absence and paying store staff a bonus, coupled with the decision to return \u00a3230m of business rates relief. Potts said:  \u201cI personally wear the halving of profits as a badge of honour. It\u2019s one thing being asked to keep indoors for most of the year, it is quite another if you haven\u2019t got access to food.

Ben van Beurden\u2019s total remuneration for 2020 was \u20ac5.8m (\u00a35m), compared with about \u20ac10m the year before, the company revealed in its annual report on Thursday.

He will replace Chad Holliday, who is stepping down after six years as Shell chairman and more than 10 years as a board director.

New data from the Office for National Statistics shows that spending based on debit and credit card purchases handled by the UK\u2019s Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) jumped by 10 percentage points in the week to 4th March. That lifted spending to around 83% of its average in February 2020, just before the first lockdown. Spending on \u2018staples\u2019 (essential purchases such as food and utilities) is 120% of pre-pandemic levels, due to the lockdowns keeping people at home.      The ONS also reports that nearly a fifth of company workforces were furloughed as of the middle of February, the equivalent of over six million workers. That\u2019s up from 11% in early December, before the current lockdown began. It includes more than 60% of the workforce in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry. Its latest Business insights and impact on the UK economy says:  The proportion of businesses\u2019 workforce on furlough leave remains broadly stable at 19%, which equates to approximately 6.2 million employees, in mid-February 2021. 69% of businesses reported that none of their sites were temporarily or permanently closed (in line with the proportion currently trading), whilst the South East and London had the highest percentages of sites temporarily or permanently closed, both at 6%, equating to around 34,000 and 24,000 businesses respectively. Five industries have more than 50% of currently trading businesses experiencing a decrease in turnover compared with what is expected for this time of year. Of all businesses currently trading, 7% are providing regular coronavirus testing to the workforce, and of those businesses 11% of their workforce are being tested.     61% of the workforce in the arts, entertainment and recreation industry were on furlough between 8 to 21 Feb \u2013 the highest proportion of all industries.

Asset price moves, 11 March 2021 Photograph: XM    Marios Hadjikyriacos, analyst at XM, says the markets are anticipating huge fiscal support from the US government.  In the broader market, serenity prevailed on Wednesday as a subdued US inflation print and a solid 10-year Treasury auction calmed global bond yields, propelling the Dow Jones to a new record high. Rising yields are generally negative for stock markets, so when yields stabilize or pull back like yesterday, equities breathe a sigh of relief. Adding fuel to the cheerful mood was news that Congress gave final approval to the colossal $1.9 trillion spending bill and that President Biden will now turn his attention to an infrastructure investment package, which might be in the ballpark of $2.5 trillion. Make no mistake, this level of government support is unprecedented. It makes the New Deal look almost like child\u2019s play in percentage of GDP terms. This could be the new theme in markets. Even if the final figure is watered down as the negotiations unfold, there\u2019s no question that throwing even more money at the problem is going to turbocharge the US economy, especially if that spending is directed at infrastructure that tends to generate a higher \u2018multiplier effect\u2019 and positive spillover effects.

The group, which said it expects to see a \u201csolid recovery\u201d this year, ran up \u00a33.1bn in impairment charges which pushed it to a loss last year. WPP reported revenues less pass through costs - a key metric closely watched by analysts - of 8.2% last year slightly ahead of consensus.  The advertising group has seen significant improvement since reporting a 15.1% decline in the second quarter, with revenues shrinking by 6.5% in the final three months of 2020. \u201cWPP\u2019s performance has been remarkably resilient,\u201d said Mark Read, WPP chief executive, adding:  \u201cWhile revenue was significantly impacted as clients reduced spending, our performance exceeded our own expectations and those of the market throughout the year. While uncertainties remain around the impact of the vaccine roll-out and economic growth, we continue to expect 2021 to be a year of solid recovery.\u201d  WPP raised its full-year dividend by 5.7% to 24p a share, and said it would resume a \u00a3620m share buyback plan, as the company\u2019s net debt hit its lowest level in 16 years. WPP reiterated its guidance for 2021 saying it expected to return to positive organic growth by the second quarter.        9.44am GMT       Lucy Powell MP, Labour\u2019s Shadow Minister for Business and Consumers, says the news John Lewis could close more stores shows that high street retailers need more help:  \u201cThis news is really worrying for John Lewis employees and is yet another blow for our struggling high streets.  \u201cThe pandemic has accelerated changes to the way we shop, but the Government continuing to disadvantage bricks and mortar shops over online companies is cranking up the pressure and leading to businesses collapsing that may otherwise have had a bright future as our country recovers.  \u201cUnless the Government puts in place a proper long-term plan for our high streets, including real action to help level the playing field and to ease the weight of debt piling up on businesses, we will see more shops vanishing and our high streets hollowed out.\u201d     Updated at 9.47am GMT     9.28am GMT       Here\u2019s our news story on Rolls-Royce\u2019s 2020 loss:  Rolls-Royce has reported a loss of \u00a34bn for 2020 as the jet-engine manufacturer\u2019s business was shaken by the coronavirus pandemic.

The group, which also owns Waitrose, confirmed it would not be paying a bonus to staff for the first time in 67 years. John Lewis also forecast that its financial results for 2021 would be even worse, due to investment in its online shopping service and other measures in its turnaround plan. The staff-owned business\u2019s first-ever full-year loss comes after \u00a3648m of one-off costs relating to the writedown in value of John Lewis shops amid the shift to online shopping, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs from store closures and head office reorganisation.    John Lewis may not reopen some stores as group slumps to \u00a3517m loss https://t.co/umMdcpjLze&mdash; Sarah Butler (@whatbutlersaw) March 11, 2021    Chairman Sharon White said the group would be holding on to government business rates relief and furlough support worth \u00a3190m which had \u201chelped to keep us running and avoid more severe restructuring\u201d. White said the group intended to continue claiming business rates relief until June. The group confirmed some of its stores would not be reopening when lockdown measures are lifted in April. The group is in discussions with landlords about the future of some shops and final decisions are expected by the end of March. White said:   \u201cHard as it is, there is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store. \u201cWe are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain.\u201d  More here:   Related: John Lewis may not reopen some stores as group slumps to \u00a3517m loss      Updated at 10.42am GMT     9.15am GMT       In happier times, John Lewis\u2019s annual results would include a bonus for partners - typically worth many weeks of extra pay. But there\u2019s no staff bonus this year for the first time in over six decades, as expected, given the \u00a3517m loss suffered last year. White says:  We wish we were in a position to pay a bonus and it has been a very difficult decision not to. The Partnership Board believed that to do so would have held back our ability to protect the business in very difficult times and to lay the foundations to return to sustainable profit. We are committed to restarting bonus as soon as our profits (before exceptionals) reach \u00a3150m on a sustainable basis and our debt ratio is below 4 times, and to paying the voluntary real living wage when profits rise to \u00a3200m.        9.04am GMT       John Lewis has also defended its decision to keep business rates relief - saying the move has helped protect jobs. It explains that it has received \u00a3190m of support from the government - in business rates relief and furlough support (the latter claimed only to July 2020, it says).  In today\u2019s letter to partners, Chairman Sharon White explains:  Government funding has been used for the purpose it was designed for - to protect the business - and was critical to cover the direct operational costs relating to Covid and the substantial hit to trading operating profit. The business rates relief has helped to keep us running and avoid more severe restructuring of the Partnership, which would have put more jobs at risk at a time when the high street is already under pressure. We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain. Therefore, our current intention is to accept the business rates relief made available from April to June, but we will keep this under review.   Late last year, many supermarket chains bowed to pressure and returned almost \u00a32bn of business rates relief, acknowledging that they had kept trading during the lockdowns while non-essential shops closed. John Lewis, though, has resisted - even though Waitrose also stayed open during the lockdown (while its department stores were forced to shut).       8.47am GMT       Waitrose grew its trading operating profits by \u00a382m last year, to \u00a31.145bn, as it benefited from the surge of grocery sales in the lockdowns. However, that was more than wiped out by the closure of the John Lewis Partnership\u2019s department stores, where trading operating profits fell by \u00a3180m to \u00a3554m. The group says:  Trading operating profit was significantly challenged as the improvement seen in Waitrose, in part helped by the closure of the hospitality industry, was insufficient to cover the substantial decline in John Lewis as \u201cnon-essential\u201d physical retailing closed temporarily.       John Lewis Partnership\u2019s 2020 annual results Photograph: John Lewis Partnership    As this results table shows, the \u201csubstantial exceptional costs\u201d of \u00a3648m (due to writing down the value of its John Lewis shops, and restructuring and redundancy costs) pull the partnership into the \u00a3517m pre-tax loss.       8.23am GMT       John Lewis says it is taking \u201cvery difficult decisions\u201d, pointing out that it has already closed some of its department stores and Waitrose grocery shops.  We entered this year with our financial performance already challenged - profits and Partner bonus having fallen for the past three years. We are having to take very difficult decisions to return the business to a path of sufficient profit of \u00a3400m by 2025/26. Last year we closed eight John Lewis stores and seven Waitrose stores that were loss making, and we are in the process of reducing the cost of our head office by 20%.  And on Brexit, it says...  We have seen limited impact from Brexit so far operationally owing to our advance preparations and the Brexit trade deal. The one area of the business that is temporarily disrupted is deliveries to Northern Ireland and we expect to resume these before the summer.         8.08am GMT    John Lewis warns of store closures    Just in: UK high street retailer John Lewis has warned that some of its shops are not expected to reopen when the lockdown ends. In its latest financial results, just released, chair Sharon White says that the group is \u2018in discussions\u2019 with landlords, and a final decision will be taken by the end of this month. White explains:  Hard as it is, there is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store. Regrettably, we do not expect to reopen all our John Lewis shops at the end of lockdown, which will also have implications for our supply chain. We are currently in discussions with landlords and final decisions are expected by the end of March.  Closing a store is one of the hardest decisions we can make as a Partnership. We are acutely sensitive to the impact on our Partners, customers and communities, particularly at a time when retail and our high streets are undergoing major structural change. We will do everything we can to lessen the impact and will continue to provide community funds to support local areas.  Last month, it was reported that John Lewis was considering closing up to 8 of its 42 stores, in response to the impact which Covid-19 has had on the high street.   Related: John Lewis considering fresh store closures in response to Covid    John Lewis has also reported that it made a pre-tax loss of \u00a3517m for the last financial year, to the end of January, down from a pre-tax profit of \u00a3146m a year earlier.    #Breaking Retail giant John Lewis Partnership has warned over further store closures as it reported pre-tax losses of \u00a3517 million for the year to January 30 pic.twitter.com/NrXiTn2bc9&mdash; PA Media (@PA) March 11, 2021    The company explains:  In a difficult year, the Partnership recorded a Loss before tax of \u00a3(517)m, compared to a Profit before tax of \u00a3146m in the previous year. This is the result of substantial exceptional costs of \u00a3(648)m, mainly the write down in the value of John Lewis shops owing to the pronounced shift to online, as well as restructuring and redundancy costs from store closures and changes to our head office. John Lewis shops are now held on our balance sheet at almost half the value they were before this year\u2019s and last year\u2019s write downs. Before the pandemic we judged that \u00a36 in every \u00a310 spent online with John Lewis was driven by our shops. The ratio has fallen to \u00a33 in every \u00a310.

Photograph: Edgar Su/Reuters    UK aerospace engineer Rolls-Royce has posted a deep loss for 2020, as the pandemic hit the airline industry hard. Rolls-Royce, which makes and services jet engines, made a pre-tax loss of \u00a32.9bn last year - or nearly \u00a34bn on an underlying pre-tax basis (down from an underlying pre-tax profit of \u00a3583m in 2019).  The Derby-based firm also says it has cut 7,000 jobs, out of the 9,000 roles being axed under its restructuring programme.  In total we expect the restructuring to lead to the reduction of at least 9,000 roles by the end of 2022, most of which are in Civil Aerospace. By the end of the year, approximately 7,000 permanent and contractor roles had been removed with a significant proportion achieved through voluntary severance and natural attrition.   Chief executive Warren East says 2020 was an \u201cunprecedented year\u201d (no argument there), forcing the largest restructuring in the company\u2019s recent history. But, Rolls-Royce also hopes that free cash flow will turn positive during the second half 2021, as the global economy reopens. East adds:  We have made a good start on our programme of disposals and will continue with this in 2021. We continue to invest in developing market-leading technology and low carbon opportunities in all our end markets, to create value for our stakeholders and ensure we are well positioned to take advantage of the transition to a lower carbon economy and growing demand for more sustainable power solutions.\u201d      Rolls-Royce plunges to worse than expected $5.6 billion loss https://t.co/7Aqh7U4K7Y pic.twitter.com/TBfbN6EjwX&mdash; Reuters (@Reuters) March 11, 2021         7.17am GMT    Introduction: US stimulus boost markets as ECB decision awaited    Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global stocks markets continue to push higher, after the US House of Representatives passed Joe Biden\u2019s landmark $1.9trn stimulus package.  The bill, which should be signed tomorrow, aims to stimulate its recovery and lift millions of Americans out of poverty. It could also give the global economy a significant boost. Biden\u2019s 628-page bill, named the American Rescue Plan, includes provide direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, extends the $300-per-month supplemental unemployment benefits, and direct tens of billions of dollars to expand Covid-19 testing and vaccine distribution.   Related: US House passes $1.9tn Covid relief plan in major legislative victory for Biden    Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank says:  The direct payments of $1400 to a majority of Americans will be sent out within days of the President\u2019s signature, while the $300/week supplemental unemployment benefits will now be extended to September with no lapse. Treasury Secretary Yellen was out selling the package, anticipating that the legislation could allow the labour market to recover to full employment by the end of 2022.  Last night the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a new record high, also helped by a benign US inflation report. Overnight, Asia-Pacific stocks have rebounded strongly, with China\u2019s CSI 300 up 2% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei up 0.6%. The US stimulus package has been widely expected, but confirmation that it has been approved seems to have reassured traders. David Madden of CMC Markets:  Several hours after the end of European trading, it was announced that Congress backed the $1.9 trillion stimulus plan so it will be passed over to President Biden to sign off. The Dow Jones hit another record high, it closed above 32,000, following the announcement of the relief package.

European Central Bank officials will have to decide at their meeting today whether rising government-bond yields across the globe threaten the region\u2019s virus-stricken economy  The ECB will also release its latest economic forecasts, and it emerged yesterday that they\u2019ll take a cautious view about inflation prospects. According to ECB insiders, the new macroeconomic projections will predict that Europeans won\u2019t blow their hoarded savings in a sudden consumption boom when lockdown restrictions ease. Analysts aren\u2019t expecting any policy changes from the ECB, which will also be pondering the recent rise in eurozone government bond yields. Naeem Aslam of AvaTrade says:  Today\u2019s most important event is the European Central Bank\u2019s meeting and its decision on monetary policy. No drama is expected as the ECB isn\u2019t anticipated to change its monetary policy\u2019s sailing path. It is highly likely that we may hear the echo of the same message that we had in the RBA and BOC\u2019s monetary policy meetings, and that is: the ECB is likely to play down any qualms around inflation. The message is likely to say that any surge in inflation is most likely to be temporary, and market players should not expect any change in the monetary policy.

Eoin Morgan says India are favourites to win the World Cup they host later this year, while Virat Kohli believes this tag belongs to England. These conflicting views were essentially just a bit of pre-match pantomime but five games in the giant Narendra Modi stadium \u2013 tipped to welcome bumper crowds \u2013 will certainly go a long way to helping both sides shape plans, personnel, match-ups and tactics before the main event in October.   Related: England must learn lessons from India tour but future still looks bright | Ebony Rainford-Brent    This is not to say there is not expectation. India deal with it every time they step on to the field, while England are under a wee bit of pressure to put on a show \u2013 for the sake of the selectors if no one else \u2013 given the rotation system, much chuntered about after the 3-1 Test defeat, was devised with this series at its apex. While they have risen to No 1 in the rankings, it is not often Morgan has all the multi-format stars at his disposal. This was the case before Christmas when they brushed South Africa aside 3-0, however, and it would be a surprise if England veered away from the top six then which had Jason Roy and Jos Buttler open, before Dawid Malan, Jonny Bairstow, Ben Stokes and the captain following behind. There are subplots here. Roy is in need of runs after a lean time since his flashing blade ignited England\u2019s 50-over World Cup campaign in 2019 and is likely to be challenged by spin early, while Malan, already the subject of a \u201chow can India stop him?\u201d headline in the local press after rising to the top of the format\u2019s batting rankings, plays his first international cricket on the subcontinent. But chiefly England\u2019s selection decisions appear to be between two all-rounders in Moeen Ali and Sam Curran at No 7 and, unless both play, the fourth bowler alongside Adil Rashid, Chris Jordan and Jofra Archer. England sometimes struggle with economy and wickets in the powerplay, something Morgan says has been masked by the batting unit\u2019s ability to either build or chase big totals. Tom Curran, Mark Wood and Reece Topley are the options in India and the good news is that Archer is fit after an elbow injury curtailed his Test series. He is also seemingly smarting from a suggestion that he is not motivated by all three formats but Morgan has no problems from a white-ball perspective (bar perhaps the fact his 90mph spearhead is limited to only four overs in Twenty20 cricket). \u201cJofra is a huge asset,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cHe is a guy who can bowl in three parts of the game and be threatening when he comes on. He obviously has express pace, can bowl cutters, variations and has a very good yorker.\u201d Morgan similarly waxed lyrical about Moeen, describing the all-rounder\u2019s experience as \u201cworth its weight in gold\u201d, and his spin bowling could be important if the England captain gets pitches he hopes will further the education of his batsmen. Rashid, a rare England player without an Indian Premier League deal and hoping to gain more experience of the conditions, will hope this is the case also. India, meanwhile, are aiming to forge their Twenty20 identity, despite a recent series victory in Australia and sitting second in the rankings. Kohli, just shy of 3,000 runs in the format, wants more power in the batting and not least since Jasprit Bumrah, peerless when it comes to defence with the ball, is absent because of a clash with his wedding. Kohli said: \u201cWe want to be a side that plays free cricket, and not have any baggage from lack of depth with one guy having to bat long enough to make sure we get to a big total. We have explosive batsmen in the team now, who can change the game at any stage, even if we\u2019re two or three wickets down.\u201d After a formidable top three of KL Rahul, Rohit Sharma and Kohli, potential for fireworks lower down comes from Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya. The former had a quiet IPL last year but was superb during the recent Tests, while the latter is being spoken about as a rival to Kieron Pollard of West Indies as a gamechanging hitter.     The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.   Thereafter it is down to which combination of bowlers can best make up for the loss of Bumrah. Five games on the same square should bring spinners into the equation and though Ravichandran Ashwin is not a feature of this squad \u2013 summing up India\u2019s depth \u2013 Axar Patel is an option if Kohli wants to prey on scars from the Test series. All told, both sides are impressive but with areas still to fully nail down before the World Cup comes into view.

The duo did not dominate immediately, of course, for back in 2005 Luis Garc\u00eda was the undisputed king. But their rises had certainly begun and they have reigned supreme since then, give or take the odd 8-2 M\u00fcllering, and a few international no-shows by one of Argentina\u2019s finest. \nRonaldo and Messi have been ushered through the Gate Marked Also-Rans as the players set to replace them in the affections of YouTube editors worldwide shone again. Erling Braut Haaland did the business for Dortmund while Messi was relegated to a sideshow by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s PSG and Ousmane Demb\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019s bracing exhibition of terrible finishes. Trooper that he is, Messi fought defiantly to retain top billing, outdoing his teammates\u2019 misses by botching a penalty. At that stage, Bar\u00e7a still had qualification if not within their sights, then at least detectable by the sort of high-powered technology English officials are deploying with thrilling randomness. \n \n  Related: Messi's penalty miss helps PSG sail through against Barcelona  \n \n Yes, all this week\u2019s talk of changing of the guards and the beginning and ending of eras presumably referred to the most compelling evidence yet of the alarming expansion of England\u2019s exceptionalist officiating. First, Stockley Park boffins deployed state-of-the-art cameras to not see Phil Foden being tripped in the Premier League in an incident that Pep Guardiola described, pointedly in slow motion, as \u201cIN-CRED-I-BLE, IN\u2026. CRED\u2026 I \u2026. BLE\u201d. \nThen, a team of elite English sticklers in Paris used similar equipment to award PSG a penalty that no one reasonably asked for after Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet didn\u2019t jump out of the way of Mauro Icardi, in an incident that might as well have happened at Sydney Opera House given how much it actually affected events at the Parc des Princes. Mbapp\u00e9 converted the penalty, and then the same officials failed to spot Marco Verratti encroaching when Messi goofed from the spot a few minutes later. Farewell, Messi and Ronaldo?

MacGREGOR", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "SNP focus on Scottish independence is 'wrong debate', says Starmer ", "full_article": "Keir Starmer has criticised the SNP for focusing on the \u201cwrong debate\u201d by demanding Scottish independence, but conceded the UK must \u201cchange to survive\u201d, as Labour gears up for the May elections. The Labour leader was launching his campaign for what the party expects to be a tough set of elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and English councils. Labour has often previously run completely separate campaigns in Scotland, but Starmer is keen to stress that Labour is focused on the NHS, jobs and growth throughout the UK. The new Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, appeared at the online launch event, as did the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford. Asked about recent comments from Drakeford that the UK \u201cis over\u201d, Starmer agreed that it was time for constitutional change. \u201cI believe in the United Kingdom, and what Mark Drakeford was saying was that he believes in the United Kingdom, but he recognises it\u2019s got to change to survive. And he\u2019s right about that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the debate anywhere, particularly Scotland, is simply between the status quo and independence, then it\u2019s the wrong debate. I absolutely want to make a passionate case for the United Kingdom, and a socially just Scotland in a modern United Kingdom. And that\u2019s the message we\u2019ll be carrying to the voters in Scotland this May.\u201d Starmer recently asked the former Labour prime minister Gordon Brown to chair a constitutional commission, which will examine the status of Scotland and Wales as well as the case for more English devolution. Brown has previously promoted federalism \u2013 with sweeping new powers for Holyrood \u2013 as the best response to the pressure for independence and the uncertainty unleashed by Brexit. In his speech at the launch event, Sarwar said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s credible for us to come through this collective trauma and go back to the old arguments. Arguing with each other while our NHS loses out on funding. Arguing with each other while our businesses close down and children miss out on vital education. \u201cAnd therefore I want people to know that the Scottish Labour party is on their side. It\u2019s on their side on the issues that matter to them.\u201d In the 2016 Holyrood elections, Labour under Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership was pushed into third place by the Conservatives. It hopes to regain some of that ground in May. The party has been buoyed up by several recent polls suggesting that support for independence is slipping modestly, and the public falling-out between Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon may have dented SNP support. A YouGov poll for the Times on Thursday suggested 36% of voters think there should be a referendum on Scottish independence this year if the SNP wins a majority at Holyrood \u2013 down from 43% last November. Support for independence itself slipped to 49%, from 51% in November. A separate poll for the Scotsman newspaper this week suggested the SNP could miss out on a majority in May\u2019s elections, which were delayed from last year because of the pandemic. In Westminster, Boris Johnson\u2019s government is devoting an increasing amount of political energy to trying to undermine the case for Scottish independence, including by highlighting the success of the vaccine programme as a cross-UK endeavour. The prime minister reportedly told a recent meeting of backbench Tory MPs that without the union, \u201cthe SNP government in Scotland would not have a single vaccine for the Scottish people\u201d. As well as the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, there will be elections to many local councils in England on 6 May, as well as a string of mayoralties, including in the West Midlands, Manchester and Teesside. Labour is playing down hopes of making gains, but many in the party will see the results as a test of Starmer\u2019s progress in rebuilding support after the 2019 general election defeat. The Electoral Commission has published new guidance on Thursday about how the elections can be conducted. Candidates will be allowed to knock on doors or deliver campaign leaflets, as long as they give their party\u2019s pitch from 2 metres away and do not go inside. They will also be able to offer masks and hand sanitiser to people as a way to encourage them to turn out to vote \u2013 but only if this is \u201cto assist voters generally\u201d, and not to encourage them to vote a certain way, an offence known as \u201ctreating\u201d. If masks or bottles of sanitiser carry a party logo or slogan, they must then also then have the small print that is seen on election leaflets, stating who has paid for it. Also, someone wearing a party logo mask may be asked to change it if they wear it to a polling station, as campaign items are not allowed there. Finally, if parties do decide they want to hand out masks or sanitiser, this counts as election spending and must be included on their spending return.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "UK forced to delay checks on imports from EU by six months", "full_article": "The UK government has been forced to delay the introduction of import checks by six months, in a U-turn in post-Brexit policy, because a network of 30 border posts being built to process incoming goods would not have been ready on time. Exports to the EU from Britain have been subject to controls since 1 January, but the government decided to opt for a phased approach on EU imports to give hauliers and business more time to adapt. Checks were due to be introduced in stages from 1 April and from 1 July, but in recent days traders and ports have said they are not ready and that the introduction of processes as originally planned could lead to empty supermarket shelves. Michael Gove, the minister for the Cabinet Office, told the House of Commons on Thursday that the government had responded to businesses\u2019 requests for more time and announced what he called a \u201crevised timetable\u201d. Gove blamed the need for delays on the pandemic, telling MPs the previous timetable was \u201cbased on the impacts of the first wave of Covid\u201d but that the government had reviewed deadlines because the disruption had been wider and longer-lasting than expected. Most import checks have now been pushed back to 1 January 2022, meaning Britain will begin these processes a year later than the EU. Andrew Opie, the director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, a lobby group, said the postponement had come \u201cin the nick of time\u201d. He said it would \u201cultimately reduce the impact on consumers from 1 April who might otherwise have seen empty shelves for some products\u201d. Opie added: \u201cUntil the infrastructure is in place, with IT systems ready and established processes for checks and paperwork, it would be foolhardy to introduce full requirements for export health certificate documentation, pre-notification of imports, physical checks and more.\u201d British customs were due to begin controlling imports of animal products, live animals and plants and products from 1 April, including food considered high-risk such as mince and sausages. The checks, known as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) controls, require consignments to have the correct documentation and import and health certificates signed by vets on arrival in Britain. These SPS checks along with customs inspections were expected to take place from 1 July at new designated border control posts (BCPs) on goods entering by sea, road or air. However, in recent weeks a string of British ports had said the facilities would not be ready in time for the July deadline, partly as a result of complications with the government\u2019s funding of the new infrastructure. This week the British Ports Association, an industry body, wrote to the government to urge it to extend the deadline. In addition, several of the inland facilities being built by the government at locations where there is not enough space available for a border control post directly next to the port are running behind schedule. The White Cliffs inland site in Kent, where goods arriving at Dover will be checked, is described as still being a \u201cmuddy field\u201d. In addition, the locations of the two inland sites in Wales that are being developed by the Welsh and UK governments have not yet been announced. Physical SPS checks on animal products, as well as foods and plants considered high risk will not take place until 1 January. From this date these checks will take place at designated border control posts rather than at their destination, as is currently the case. Checks on live animals and low-risk plants will only take place from March 2022 at BCPs. In addition, traders will be able to continue submitting deferred customs declarations, whereby paperwork can be provided up to six months after goods have been imported, until the start of 2022.

The EU is preparing to launch legal action within days after the government last week announced it was unilaterally extending a series of \u201cgrace periods\u201d to allow businesses in Northern Ireland more time to adapt to post-Brexit rules.

On their own terms, the 18 pieces the composer completed, before ill-health forced him to stop composing four years before his death in 2006, continue the great tradition of transcendental piano writing that stretches back to Chopin and Liszt, always testing their performers\u2019 techniques to the limit and sometimes beyond.     Ligeti: The 18 \u00c9tudes by Danny Driver album cover Photograph: Publicity image    Yet stylistically Ligeti\u2019s piano writing owes very little, if anything, to the composers who defined that tradition. The influences shaping these pieces are those that permeate all of his later work, after it changed direction so decisively in the early 1980s \u2013 from the polyrhythmic player-piano studies of Conlon Nancarrow to the music of sub-Saharan Africa, chaos theory to the minimalism of Steve Reich. In the \u00c9tudes, Ligeti effectively created a new pianistic vocabulary, while remaining exuberantly himself \u2013 the moments when the music seems to evaporate in the highest reaches of the keyboard, or flounders in its lowest depths, find orchestral equivalents throughout his music of more than 40 years. Danny Driver has been including groups of the pieces in his recital programmes for some years now. It\u2019s clearly music that he admires hugely and understands profoundly, and, as he writes in his sleeve notes, the challenge is \u201cputting the emotional and evocative power of these pieces centre stage despite their intransigent virtuosity\u201d. He manages to do that better than any of the other complete surveys of these pieces I\u2019ve heard; only Pierre-Laurent Aimard\u2019s magisterial recordings, split across two totally separate discs, match and sometimes surpass his insights. But Driver\u2019s performances certainly leave no doubt of the music\u2019s dazzling originality and enduring importance.

The main work on his latest disc (the fourth in a projected series of 17) is another of Alkan\u2019s greatest achievements, the Symphonie that forms four movements of his Op 39, the 12 \u00c9tudes in All the Minor Keys, a set that also includes the Concerto for solo piano and a final huge set of variations, Le Festin d\u2019\u00c9sope.        The Symphony is music of immense technical complexity \u2013 ferocious double octaves, massive chordal explosions, vertiginous scales \u2013 with occasional moments of quiet lyricism, and Viner negotiates it all with wonderful aplomb and just the right amount of swagger. He doesn\u2019t spare himself on the rest of the disc either, in a sequence of marches and two programmatic paraphrases, all dazzlingly played.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Kimmel on Biden's Covid relief bill: 'Naturally, Republicans are against it'", "full_article": "Jimmy Kimmel The US House passed a sweeping $1.9tn Covid relief bill on Wednesday, a massive emergency relief measure that marks the first major legislative victory of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The bill, passed along party lines in the House and Senate, will provide critical financial relief to millions of Americans through $1,400 stimulus checks, extend unemployment benefits in the middle of a pandemic-induced recession, and expand access to healthcare. \u201cSo naturally, Republicans are against it,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel joked on Wednesday night.              No Republicans voted for the bill in either the House or the Senate, \u201ceven though more than 70% of Americans support it\u201d, Kimmel continued. \u201cThe only other bill 70% of Americans support is Murray.

Except for making the Polar Express.\u201d              In the last year, white women have been joining QAnon in droves, becoming the primary drivers of the conspiracy movement. So-called \u201cQ-A-moms\u201d, often members of natural or holistic birth communities, have been targeted by posts about child sex trafficking conspiracies that appeal to their protective maternal instincts. These posts often don\u2019t mention Q specifically but hint at larger conspiracies of sex trafficking cover-ups in the familiar soothing, Instagram-friendly aesthetic common to wellness ads. \u201cPastel QAnon\u201d, as Bee called this recruitment method, is \u201cat least better than the first name they gave it, which is \u2018crazy bitch shit\u2019\u201d, she joked. During the pandemic, \u201cmany women took to the internet to ask questions about how to keep their family safe, and landed in a pit of pseudo-scientific research that suggested masks made coronavirus worse, and that social distancing weakened the immune system\u201d, Bee explained. \u201cBefore long, those conspiracies evolved into wilder rumors about the deep state and child trafficking. \u201cThese kinds of theories may sound ridiculous, but as we saw during the Capitol insurrection, they have very real consequences,\u201d she added, noting that QAnon devotee Ashli Babbitt was shot and killed by Capitol police during the riot. \u201cAnd QAnon\u2019s online mommy rebrand has only caused more damage.\u201d Seth Meyers              And on Late Night, Seth Meyers blasted the faux cancel culture wars fomented by Fox News in the face of Biden\u2019s popular Covid relief bill.

The staff-owned retailer, which runs 42 department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, confirmed it would not be paying a bonus to staff for the first time in 67 years, as chairman, Sharon White, said it was \u201cnot out of the crisis\u201d caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. John Lewis said it was unlikely to pay a bonus again next year either when it forecast the financial results would be even worse, owing to investment in a five-year turnaround plan. In the year ahead, the group plans to plough \u00a3800m into improving stores and upgrading online shopping infrastructure including developing its shopping app for smartphones. \u201cIt\u2019s been a real economic earthquake.

The group has set aside \u00a375m to cover restructuring in the year ahead, which is likely to include job losses at closing stores and other operational changes. White said: \u201cHard as it is, there is no getting away from the fact that some areas can no longer profitably sustain a John Lewis store. We are not out of the crisis yet and the economic environment remains extremely uncertain.\u201d Some industry watchers have suggested the changes could leave John Lewis no different to the likes of Argos \u2013 where it is possible to order goods online and pick them up in a store. Pippa Wicks, the boss of the John Lewis department stores, said staff would continue to use specialist knowledge to offer extra services both on the high street and online where the group now offers virtual personal styling or home advice sessions. \u201cWe are absolutely not the Argos of the middle classes,\u201d she said. White plans to introduce new lower-priced products when its department stores reopen in a bid to improve value for money under plans to ditch its \u201cnever knowingly undersold\u201d pricing pledge which has been in place since 1925. Sales at the John Lewis chain slipped just 4% to just over \u00a34bn and operating profits were down by about 25% as online sales soared 73%, almost offsetting 20 weeks of store closures in the year. Online now accounts for three-quarters of the department store\u2019s trade, up from 42% before the pandemic. Sales were helped by a rush for technology to support home working and schooling. However, fashion and cosmetics sales dived as the need for workwear and outfits for social occasions slumped under lockdown restrictions.     Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk    At Waitrose, sales jumped 10% to \u00a37.6bn and operating profits rose 8% to \u00a31.1bn. The supermarket also experienced a big switch to online trading which now accounts for 20% of sales, up from 5% before the pandemic. White said she expected most of the online shift to be permanent but that the group\u2019s stores would remain an important part of its business. \u201cThe high street is changing and our place on it is changing with it,\u201d she said. Before the one-off writedowns, group profits rose to \u00a3131m in the year to 30 January from \u00a370m a year before, underpinned by the business rates support. White said the outcome was better than her fears of a small loss as trading had been stronger than expected in the second half of the year, with consumers switching to online shopping during the national lockdowns. Nick Bubb, an independent retail analyst, expressed surprise that the John Lewis Partnership (JLP) had neither paid out a bonus to staff nor returned the Waitrose business rates relief, given what he described as a \u201cdecent\u201d underlying performance. \u201cWith profits emerging so much better than expected, JLP should have changed its stance,\u201d he said.", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "The future of cookbooks? Here's what happened when I tested Ruby Tandoh's audio baking guide", "full_article": "It must be difficult to deliver recipes in a pioneering way. This is because, in the cookbook, the form has already reached its apex. If you\u2019ve never used a cookbook before, you\u2019re really missing out. You open the book at the correct page, and then all the information just stays exactly where it is until you don\u2019t need it any more. It\u2019s brilliant, maybe even unimprovable. But trying telling that to Ruby Tandoh, who is about to release the future of cookbooks in Breaking Eggs. Imagine an audiobook that tells you how to bake things \u2013 that\u2019s Breaking Eggs. And it claims to be the first of its kind. Intrigued by the prospect of a cookbook you can\u2019t see, I recently spent a morning attempting to follow it. Breaking Eggs consists of just four recipes; a butter cake, an apple galette, some vanilla custard buns and some brownies, each narrated in real time by Tandoh. I was highly sceptical of this as a concept, so I picked the butter cake on the basis that it seemed quite easy, and would therefore be over quickest. I was sceptical because you should be allowed to cook things at your own pace. Some people like to scan the recipe once and plunge in, others like to read and re-read to make sure they\u2019re going to get it right. And although the audio guide comes with a pdf listing the ingredients and equipment you\u2019ll need, the thought of encountering each step for the first time, while you\u2019re already in the middle of making the thing, seemed unnecessarily stressful. Remember those old Gordon Ramsay cookalong shows, where you ostensibly made a Christmas dinner in real time with him? Nobody actually did that. It was a stupid idea. Nevertheless, I assembled my ingredients and gave it my best shot. The baking No sooner has Tandoh talked you though the ingredients than she slows to a crawl, spending two minutes telling you how to put some butter and sugar into a bowl. Not how to mix it \u2013 that comes later \u2013 but just how to put them into a bowl. \u201cWhile you get on with that, let me tell you a bit more about cake\u201d, she says, before explaining the role of moisture in cake. Too little moisture will make the cake \u201cstodgy and dry\u201d, too much and \u201cit\u2019ll be gluey\u201d. This sort of meditative riffing is a nice touch, but less appreciated when time is of the essence. For example, during this stage, my three-year-old wandered up and offered to help me bake, which largely involved him trying to smash an egg on the dining table while shouting \u201cSTOP TALKING\u201d at the phone on which I was playing the recipe. This meant I had to take my buttery hands and wipe them all over the phone to pause the recording.      Ready, steady ... wait till you\u2019re told what to do next. Photograph: Stuart Heritage    This is roughly when I realised that the problem was less to do with Tandoh\u2019s guide and more to do with my circumstances. Baking used to be something that I did to relax; taking long, leisurely mornings to assemble something beautiful with as much care as possible. But now I\u2019ve taken to hammering through recipes, cutting corners and missing details because the kids are crying and work keeps emailing and there\u2019s laundry to be folded and a million other things.      Stuart Heritage and his son while attempting Breaking Eggs. Photograph: Stuart Heritage    This is how I entered into Breaking Eggs; stressed, distracted and on three separate deadlines. If it had been a book, I would have glanced at the instructions once and chucked together a rough approximation from memory as quickly as possible. But because it was an audio guide, and because Tandoh\u2019s narration was so slow and measured, I had no option but to fall in behind her. When she tells you to line a tin with baking paper, and then spends the next two minutes discussing the various properties of cake as a concept, you\u2019re pretty much banned from moving on. You\u2019re much more likely to spend those two minutes concentrating on the lining. This quickly becomes the tempo. When you cream the butter and eggs, Tandoh does such a thorough job of explaining its importance that you\u2019ll invariably take more care over it than usual. Same with adding eggs. I may not have wanted to at first, but Breaking Eggs slowed me down. It forced me to concentrate on every step. Even licking the bowl. \u201cRaw flour and raw eggs can contain nasty germs, so I wouldn\u2019t recommend you do this,\u201d she says. \u201cOr would I? Look, you\u2019re your own boss\u201d. The result The chapter ends with Tandoh telling us to put the cake in the oven, wash up and watch something nice on television. An hour later, I\u2019m rewarded with a cake that is beautiful, dense and rich with vanilla. It was gone in about two hours. Whether that\u2019s down to Tandoh\u2019s recipe, or because the mode of delivery demands that the listener takes care, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a bit of both.     Proof is in the eating ... Stuart\u2019s cake. Photograph: Stuart Heritage    As it went into the oven, my three-year-old grabbed the spatula, jammed it into his mouth and ran away into the living room. He poked his head back in a couple of moments later and asked if we could bake something together again soon. Maybe this is the future after all.

Both the book and Bruce Beresford\u2019s 1981 film adaptation offered a sharp rebuttal to the idealised version of the Australian beach \u2013 that of an egalitarian paradise \u2013 that has long lived in our collective imagination. The beach is justifiably a beloved part of Australian life, but we also know that for many it can be exclusionary and unsafe. The brilliance of Puberty Blues, the 2012 television adaptation of Carey and Lette\u2019s book that ran for two seasons, is that it embraces these conflicting truths about the beach and, by extension, our national identity.   Related: Love: offbeat romcom about addiction, dating and two basically terrible people    Explicit criticism of misogyny within the characters\u2019 surfing community remains fundamental to the series. As our heroes Debbie and Sue discover, the surfing gang they long to join rules the beach, and their bodies. Girls in the Greenhills gang must eagerly provide the surfers with food, admiration and sexual pleasure, and be content to get none in return. Panel vans, ubiquitous throughout the series, operate as a portable microcosm of the beach: an Australian icon that is a site of freedom for boys and sexual oppression for girls. Seeing social outcast Frieda reluctantly participating in panel van group sex with the surfers was the most harrowing moment in the film, and it\u2019s equally confronting here.     Girls in the Greenhills gang must eagerly provide the surfers with food, admiration and sexual pleasure, and be content to get none in return. Photograph: Channel 10    The series moves beyond the scope of the book and the film by examining sexism among adults in the broader community, from casual arse-grabbing in the workplace to the devastating double standards surrounding infidelity. We see how this systemic inequality seeps through generations. One of the series\u2019 most nuanced arcs belongs to Cheryl, whose mean-girl exterior is exposed as defensive acting out in response to a troubled home life and relentless mistreatment by men. Gary, apparently the only surfer with a conscience, turns to hard drugs to escape from the dual expectations of his misogynistic father and amoral mates. Despite the series\u2019 preoccupation with these bleak realities, there is also a lot of joy to be found, both in the storylines and in the lovingly rendered period detail. The heady nostalgia of crocheted bikinis, home phones and Polly Waffles is as appealing as the tender core friendship between Debbie and Sue, which triumphs above all else. The series is beautifully written, filmed and acted. It\u2019s clear that the creators hold a deep reverence for the perceived simplicity of the era, and for the appeal of the coastal communities so many Australians have grown up in. Scenes such as Sue\u2019s spirited parents drunkenly frolicking in the nighttime waves unapologetically celebrate the beach\u2019s libertarian potential.     This is just the way it was, the series seems to say \u2013 and this transparency makes the darker elements more convincing. Photograph: Channel 10    The inclusion of so much positivity might elsewhere feel jarring or contradictory, but here it just feels honest. There is no explicit attempt to demonise the beach, or the 1970s, or Australia \u2013 this is just the way it was, the series seems to say \u2013 and this transparency makes the darker elements more convincing.   Related: Blue Heelers: rewatching the classic Australian small-town police procedural    There are also some clear ties to sinister chapters of Australian beach history, particularly in the second season, which reinforces the sense of accuracy. That the series takes place in Cronulla will be enough to bring the 2005 riots to many minds, but a shockingly casual act of violence against a Japanese character in the final episode offers a more explicit link to normalised racism.  By laying bare the messy complexities of one beach community, Puberty Blues asks us to accept the discomfort that comes with loving parts of Australian culture while acknowledging the harm they can bring. The request is neatly captured in its opening song, Dragon\u2019s Are You Old Enough, a brilliant and beloved pop hit that many listeners also hear as an ode to sex with underage girls. There is no easy answer to be found: the beach is glorious and dangerous, loved and feared, liberating and oppressive. In telling us something so truthful about ourselves, the series proves itself just as revolutionary as its predecessors. \u2022 Puberty Blues is available to stream on 10Play.

The government is currently consulting with key stakeholders on draft legislation for its proposed Commonwealth Integrity Commission, after years of delay and missed deadlines. Prior to releasing the draft legislation, the proposed model was already subject to scathing criticism, particularly for its lack of public hearings, the high threshold it requires to investigate matters, its inability to act directly on public tip-offs, and the favourable way it treats politicians and public servants compared to law enforcement officials.   Related: Toothless tiger? Five problems with the Coalition's anti-corruption commission    Transparency International Australia\u2019s submission, which is yet to be published, says the draft legislation not only lacks credibility, it actually creates a \u201cretrograde\u201d system in critical areas. The current system, Transparency International argued, allows for public hearings of corruption matters through the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. \u201cThe ability to hold public hearings in certain circumstances is essential,\u201d the submission said. \u201cThe CIC would be a retrograde step as it winds back existing (ACLEI) powers to hold public hearings in respect of the bulk of the agency\u2019s operations.\u201d It says the commission\u2019s differing treatment of politicians and law enforcement is a fundamental failing, and warns the \u201ccommission must be fair and equitable in its treatment of all federal public officials irrespective of status or role\u201d. \u201cThe proposed CIC model does not yet meet the necessary criteria to render it effective and credible,\u201d the submission says. \u201cThe two-division model is a fundamental flaw that predicates other significant shortcomings.\u201d Transparency International said, however, that the CIC model could be saved with significant changes. It also said the proposed funding levels were a good starting point. Its criticisms have been echoed by other thinktanks and anti-corruption groups. Earlier this week, the National Integrity Committee, a group of retired judges, said the legislation as drafted could leave ministers exempt from investigation.   Related: Minister described $30m western Sydney airport land purchase as 'perfectly sensible'    The judges also warned that the requirement for \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d before a corruption investigation begins would prevent preliminary investigation being carried out.

In a November briefing paper, the Centre for Public Integrity warned the draft legislation prevented the CIC from conducting own-motion investigations of law enforcement corruption and did not allow it to make findings of corrupt conduct for parliamentarians or public servants. The legislation also would not operate retrospectively. \u201cWe look forward to seeing the Bill modified as required over the next six months so that the objective of creating a serious Commonwealth Integrity Commission can be achieved,\u201d the briefing paper said.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Monsters: A Reckoning by Alison Croggon review \u2013 beware the many-tentacled beast of empire", "full_article": " Alison Croggon doesn\u2019t wish her sister harm.

With Monsters, she tackles one of contemporary literature\u2019s most electric (and eclectic) forms \u2013 a kind of glorious literary mutant that braids socio-cultural contemplation and memoir; anchoring high-theory with visceral intimacy. She joins a sorority of glittering thinkers: Maggie Nelson, Kate Zambreno, Rebecca Solnit and Olivia Laing \u2013 and closer to home, Ellena Savage and Maria Tumarkin \u2013 women whose work mimics what it feels like to stretch an idea out in your brain.

I am not the commissioner of police.\u201d Treating an allegation of sexual violence as if it is, and can only ever be, a matter for police and the criminal law is legally incorrect and a dangerous message for the many women and men who have experienced sexual assault. It also kills off a measured, informed public conversation about how else we might respond. The criminal law remains, despite valiant attempts to reform it over the years, a terrible tool for dealing with gender-based sexual violence. Governmental data suggests that almost 2 million Australian adults have experienced sexual assault since the age of 15, yet only about 14% of sexual assaults in Australia are reported to police. An overwhelming majority of these reports do not end with a conviction.   Related: I was raped as a teenager. Here is why I didn\u2019t consider going to the police | Lucia Osborne-Crowley    Without a living person to provide evidence, the very low prospect of a conviction evaporates. The police discontinued their investigation into the allegations against Porter largely because of this. Is that then the end of all possible legal or institutional responses as Morrison is suggesting? The answer is no: alleged sexual violence can be investigated without police or criminal proceedings. There are a range of legal responses available to victims and their families, including a civil action in battery, a sexual harassment claim, or pursuing compensation under other statutes. In each of these instances, victims do not have to rely on police to bring their claim, and the standard of proof required is lower. In battery, more commonly known as \u201cassault\u201d, a victim can sue their alleged offender for compensation. A recent US example is the cases brought by various women against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. These civil suits are separate to his criminal prosecution. In New South Wales, where the allegations against Porter are claimed to have occurred, it is also possible, if rare and difficult, for an alleged victim\u2019s estate to bring a battery claim on behalf of the deceased. In a child sexual assault case it does not matter how many years have passed. Allegations of sexual violence can also be investigated under sexual harassment laws, without requiring determination of criminal guilt. Jemma Ewin, whose criminal case was unable to proceed because of problems with evidence, successfully argued under Australian sex discrimination laws that sexual intercourse which took place after a work function was \u201cunwelcome sexual conduct\u201d. Here the test was not the criminal \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard but that it was \u201cprobable\u201d that she had not consented to the sex. Ewin was awarded a record amount of compensation. These actions can also be difficult to bring, and they are not an adequate response to the harm of sexual violence, but they are an important aspect of the legal picture that Morrison is disregarding. There has been intense concern expressed by the government and some media commentators that the principle of \u201cinnocent until proven guilty\u201d is being undermined. It is true that a person should not be treated as if they have committed a crime if criminal standards of evidence and conviction have not been met. It is important that if there are findings against a person in civil cases or inquiries, this does not lead to a presumption that the person is guilty of a crime. But these examples show that an absence of criminal prosecution is not the end of the conversation about legal responsibility and harm. An absence of criminal prosecution also does not limit institutional responses that are directed not to a person\u2019s guilt or liability but to their suitability for a particular role. Independent inquiries are often commissioned by institutions in response to allegations. These include workplace inquiries, royal commissions, coronial inquests, anti-corruption bodies, and other everyday disciplinary proceedings. None of these processes require a previous criminal charge or prosecution. Indeed, they mostly occur in their absence.

The attorney general is Australia\u2019s highest law officer and trust in that role is institutionally important. Lawyers in particular are held to high standards of conduct and are required to prove that they are a fit and proper person to be admitted to practice law in Australia. Legal practice boards can consider complaints made against lawyers. Two legal academics have referred the attorney general to the Legal Practice Board of Western Australia, although the executive director of the board has indicated they are unlikely to investigate. There are a range of ways in which our legal system and our institutions investigate credible allegations and provide the opportunities for all parties to have their perspectives heard. It is misleading to suggest the criminal law is the be-all and end-all in such matters. If we let the end of police proceedings be the end of any discussion about alleged sexual violence, we continue the long legacy of ineffectual legal and governmental responses. We should not treat someone as guilty of a crime if allegations cannot be tested, but that does not mean that our only choice is no response at all. \u2022 Karen O\u2019Connell is associate professor at the faculty of law, University of Technology Sydney; and Liam Elphick is associate lecturer at the faculty of law, Monash University", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Townsville police used controversial neck hold on Indigenous man before he died in 2018, coroner told", "full_article": "Townsville police used a controversial neck hold banned in jurisdictions across the world during the arrest of an Indigenous man who died in 2018, court documents show. The 39-year-old, known as Noomba for cultural reasons, was arrested after his wife called police because she was concerned about his mental wellbeing. Two constables who attended were unable to find him when they first attended the couple\u2019s house late on the night of 9 February, 2018 but came across Noomba about three hours later when called to another job nearby. The officers say Noomba attempted to strike one of them before he was chased and tackled to the ground. The officer, who it is claimed Noomba attempted to strike, used a police technique known as a lateral vascular neck restraint (LVNR) hold while trying to restrain Noomba, Guardian Australia can reveal. According to documents before the Queensland coroner, the officer says he used the hold to take Noomba to the ground, before pressure was placed on his back by the other officer while handcuffs could be applied.   Related: Townsville police condemn vigilante action after death of 22-year-old woman    Noomba lost consciousness soon afterwards, as his family watched, and could not be revived. The use of the LVNR, which involves compressing arteries and veins in the neck to decrease blood supply to the brain, will be examined during an inquest by the Queensland coroner. A pre-inquest hearing was held last month, more than three years after the death, with the inquest expected to start in April. The inquest is also expected to examine the conduct of Queensland ambulance service paramedics, who were on the scene when Noomba died. The death was captured on CCTV, body-worn cameras and in vision taken by the family. Police were told before the arrest that Noomba had a history of heart problems and had been inhaling petrol on the night he died \u2013 both factors which can lead to breathing difficulties. The Queensland police service manual states that officers should not use the hold unless \u201can incident is assessed as high-risk and there is an immediate operational necessity to apply the restraint\u201d or they are \u201cacting or aiding in self-defence\u201d. It also states that officers should \u201cimmediately cease maximum compression but maintain control\u201d once the subject starts to comply, or another \u201cforce technique\u201d, such as handcuffs, can be used. Other Australian state and territory police forces, including New South Wales, have banned the use of neck restraints, but most permit a \u201creasonable\u201d use of force during arrests. Aside from the use of the LNVR, the force applied to Noomba while he was on the ground will also be examined at the inquest. In 2018, Guardian Australia reported on two brothers who died in separate incidents while being restrained face down by police and hospital guards. Since 2008, prone restraint had been implicated in the deaths of 24 people in Australia.

Human Rights Watch has said its ongoing research into academic freedom in Australia had found anxiety and loneliness among Chinese students, with some engaging in self-censorship to avoid a backlash from Beijing. Addressing an inquiry into foreign interference in the university sector, Sophie McNeill, a researcher for Human Rights Watch Australia, said on Thursday there was \u201ca very deep fear of being watched, of being reported on\u201d.   Related: Liberal senator looking for 'heroes' not just 'villains' at inquiry into universities' foreign links    McNeill, a former ABC journalist who has been leading the research project, said Human Rights Watch had so far conducted about 50 interviews, including about 25 with students from Hong Kong and mainland China and about 25 with academics who study China or teach Chinese students. Students who had suffered harassment and intimidation generally did not report this to the universities, because they \u201cdidn\u2019t feel that universities could do anything or that they didn\u2019t care\u201d. Students also expressed \u201ca lot of anxiety [as] they didn\u2019t know where to turn, they felt very lonely, very unsupported\u201d, McNeill said. Some students indicated that they never said anything in class because they believed they could not freely express themselves. \u201cAll these very young people who said that their greatest fear was their parents being visited back in China because of something they said or did or participated in while they were in Australia,\u201d McNeill told the joint committee on intelligence and security in Canberra. \u201cWhile that didn\u2019t happen to a huge number of people, we verified at least four cases where that did happen. So of course when that happens, it goes along the grapevine \u2013 everyone is really worried about that happening. \u201cA lot of the students we interviewed expressed quite a lot of surprise that they\u2019d come all the way here to only still feel that they lived in a system similar to what they were living in under the CCP [Chinese Communist party] in China.\u201d McNeill said she was aware of a student who had attended a pro-Hong Kong democracy protest later receiving a message on Facebook from someone who participated in a counter-protest. The message threatened to report the student to the Chinese consulate. The researchers had interviewed about 25 academics, \u201cwho talked about how much they struggle to just talk about China these days in universities\u201d. McNeill said an academic at a university in Victoria was recently \u201cdoxxed\u201d \u2013 had her personal information shared online \u2013 after telling a student it had been unacceptable for them to send a group email reprimanding a classmate for describing Taiwan as their place of origin \u2013 rather than recognising it as part of China. Academics feared \u201cbeing recorded by their students, doxxed if they say something controversial about Hong Kong or Xinjiang and that could risk perhaps family back home in China if they\u2019re of Chinese background, or it could endanger their ability to travel to China in the future\u201d. Elaine Pearson, the Australia director of Human Rights Watch, told the same inquiry some Australian government departments and universities appeared reluctant to acknowledge that China was the \u201cone government that is behaving in this way and that is orchestrating a lot of these threats and intimidation faced by students from China\u201d. Pearson said while other governments might raise concerns about activity on Australian campuses \u2013 for example, the Indonesian government might seek the cancellation of a West Papua protest \u2013 \u201cyou don\u2019t see universities caving to the demands of those other governments in the way that they do cave to the demands of the Chinese government\u201d. \u201cI mean you had the Dalai Lama event moved off Sydney University\u2019s campus to be held somewhere else,\u201d Pearson said, linking it to the sector\u2019s reliance on revenue from Chinese students. Pearson \u2013 who is also an adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales \u2013 said she had been disappointed about the handling of an incident last year when comments she made criticising Beijing\u2019s crackdown in Hong Kong were initially taken down by the university after a backlash. Drew Pavlou, a student activist who was suspended by the University of Queensland after counter-protesters clashed with him in 2019, told the inquiry he believed he was targeted for political reasons to protect the university\u2019s relationship with China. \u201cThe most troubling part about my experience was the kind of stifling effect it has had on free speech in our universities,\u201d Pavlou said.   Related: 'Significant overreach': universities say Australia's foreign veto bill erodes autonomy    The head of spy agency Asio, Mike Burgess, said his organisation did not concern itself with peaceful protests, but \u201cwe would be concerned, however, if a foreign government is active behind the scenes trying to covertly shut down free expression\u201d. \u201cSome foreign governments \u2013 and it\u2019s more than one \u2013 care about what their students get up to on campus \u2026 and in some cases they might use or want to use their students to counter certain things that are being said on campus as students go about their free speech, or universities and the curriculum they\u2019re teaching might be a problem for certain nation states,\u201d Burgess told the inquiry. \u201cOne country, in particular, is highly active, but they are not alone in that endeavour,\u201d he added, without naming the country. Asked whether he believed foreign governments were working through student societies to advance their interests covertly, Burgess said he would not want answer that in a public forum. Burgess backed the need for universities to be given more clarity about which research or technologies the government considered particularly sensitive.

The basic facts are clear: the owner, EnergyAustralia, had previously said the Latrobe Valley generator would close in 2032, and now it will be gone by 2028. Despite the seven-year-notice period, much of the initial reaction to the announcement focused on fears of electricity price hikes and blackouts at a distant future date. To some extent, it masked what had really happened. In reality, EnergyAustralia had made a deal with the Victorian government to keep the plant open longer than it almost certainly otherwise would have been.   Related: Yallourn, one of Australia's last brown coal power stations, to close early in favour of giant battery    Analysts have long expected Yallourn to shut early partly because it keeps breaking down, and partly because it is too inflexible to compete with the extraordinary influx of cheap renewable energy into the grid. With so much solar energy being generated in the middle of the day, wholesale electricity prices in Victoria have dropped 70% over the past year. This has been good for consumers and the climate, but bad for coal plant owners, who are struggling to stay viable. Yallourn has been hit harder than most. Modelling for the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) that assumed a slower grid transformation that that now underway had previously suggested the plant could close by about 2026. Some workers at Yallourn expected it to shut even earlier, and were relieved on Wednesday to learn they might get seven years work before it goes. EnergyAustralia linked its closure announcement to the global push to address the climate crisis, noting investors were moving away from thermal coal, and stressed shutting Yallourn would immediately cut the company\u2019s emissions by 60%. But the company was open to sweating the plant a little longer when it approached the Victorian government to make a deal on the closure. The government says it will not release details of the agreement, citing commercial confidentiality, but it doesn\u2019t deny there may be public support to ensure it remains available until that date. Victorian taxpayers could reasonably ask what they are spending to keep a 50-year-old plant online, and why the Andrews government thinks it will be needed that long.   Related: Australia needs to cut emissions by at least 50% by 2030 to meet Paris goals, experts say    The Morrison government\u2019s response included raising concerns about what a closure in seven years would mean for grid reliability and energy affordability, urging the industry to build some form of replacement and leaving open the possibility it would step in if the private sector didn\u2019t. It was a less aggressive echo of the Coalition\u2019s response when AGL announced it would shut the Liddell coal plant in NSW by 2023. Then, the government pressured the owner to extend its life before warning the taxpayer-funded Snowy Hydro may build a gas-fired generator if energy companies were too slow to commit. The near repeat performance prompted some in the electricity industry to wonder: is this what substitutes for energy policy now? Based on estimates put forward by plant owners, eight coal plants are due to shut over the next 20 years. Most experts believe that will prove a conservative timeline given the pace at which solar energy is pushing coal out. A recent analysis found up to five plants including Yallourn could be unviable within the next four years. Dylan McConnell, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Climate and Energy College, has suggested we just bring the expected closure date of every coal plant forward by half a decade. Energy policy in Australia is rife with contradictions. State governments are increasingly backing renewable energy and, in NSW, long-duration energy storage through underwriting and price guarantees. It is starting to drive the sort of transformation in electricity, if not the rest of the economy, that climate scientists warn must happen more quickly across the globe. But few in power publicly acknowledge coal closures could come in a rush. Rather than introducing policy to accelerate the inevitable shift, the Morrison government criticises the state plans and rejects calls for a national policy framework that would guide private investment in the flexible energy needed to fill the gaps around a system that the energy security board says could be 60% solar and wind by the end of the decade. The Coalition, of course, abolished a national carbon price in 2014 and spent the years following fighting itself over a series of failed potential replacements, losing a prime minister along the way. Scott Morrison has gone to great lengths to avoid re-opening an internal battle over energy, including promising to pay for a feasibility study into a new coal plant in central Queensland to placate local MPs and Senators. It is the same split that has stopped the government from at least giving lip service to a target of reaching net zero emissions, a goal backed by more than 100 countries. The energy solution devised by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, is an ad hoc mix of policies that include promising, but so far failing, to change the Clean Energy Finance Corporation so he can direct it to underwrite \u201cgrid reliability\u201d projects, such as new gas and pumped hydro plants.   Related: Australian farmers call for renewable energy zones as Nationals push coal and nuclear    Federal and state governments are funding new grid connections between the states. And there has been an initial wave of announcements of privately backed grid-scale battery announcements. But there is no overarching plan to to ensure a smooth transition if there is a run of coal closures. Business leaders and the energy security board have warned the private sector is less likely to build the new back-up capacity needed when governments are interfering in the market. Amid all this, there is a model for what a transformed electricity system will need. Aemo last year released a blueprint for an optimal grid that found renewable energy could at times reach 90% within 15 years, and between six and 19 gigawatts of new flexible energy capacity should be in place by 2040 to support it. This could come from batteries, pumped hydro, demand management programs and gas, but Aemo suggests new gas power \u2013 favoured by the Morrison government, and the only fossil fuel on the list \u2013 is likely to be more expensive than other options. The market operator describes the blueprint as an \u201cactionable roadmap\u201d that prioritises the public. It might be worth dusting off and re-considering before anyone expresses concern about the next announcement of an early coal exit.

In the category\u2019s 38-year history, almost 80% of African nations have never had an artist nominated; no Middle Eastern or eastern European musician has ever won; every winner in the past eight years has been a repeat winner; and nearly two-thirds of the nominations have come from just six countries (the US, the UK, Brazil, Mali, South Africa, India). The situation shows little signs of improving. Over the past decade, I\u2019ve produced more than 30 albums from overlooked regions, languages and persecuted populations; one won a Grammy (Tinariwen), and three others have been nominated. My two latest books (How Music Dies, Silenced by Sound) detail inequity in the global music industry, and the vast numbers of people around the world who have been overlooked, despite being every bit as, if not more, talented than the stars who dominate the global mainstream.   Related: The Grammys have a major problem with diversity. Lip service isn\u2019t going to solve it | Ian Brennan    Below are 14 of them, all from nations or regions that have never had a single artist receive a nomination in the Grammys\u2019 global category, an award whose stated aim is to celebrate \u201cexcellence\u201d in music versus sales or popularity. Many of these artists are legends in their home countries. That two have now died, and many others are of advanced age, speaks to the urgency of the matter.  Mulatu Astatke, Ethiopia Mulatu is regarded as \u201cthe father of Ethio-jazz\u201d. He has not been recognised by the Grammys, despite Ethiopia being the second most populous nation in Africa, and the 30-disc \u00c9thiopiques series being pivotal in bringing \u201cforeign\u201d music to the western world from the late-1990s onwards. Active since 1963, the percussionist and multi-instrumentalist is now 77 and continues to perform today. Entry point: Mulatu\u2019s work balances funkiness with elegance in a way almost unheard anywhere else.              Gurrumul, Australia The blind singer Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, who died in 2017, performed ethereal music, singing in various Yol\u014bu languages. A multi-instrumentalist, he became the most commercially successful Indigenous Australian musician of all time and the first Indigenous-language artist to have an album reach No 1 on the Australian charts, winning nine Aria awards (Australia\u2019s equivalent to the Grammys) and receiving 21 nominations, as well as the prestigious Australian music prize. As part of its mission, the Grammys\u2019 global music category is responsible for representing pre-colonial Indigenous culture and languages throughout Oceania and in the Americas (outside of US and Canada, which are included in a separate American regional roots category) \u2013 but such a nomination has never occurred in the category\u2019s history. Entry point: Gurrumul\u2019s songs reflect Australia\u2019s homegrown genre of country music, and the huge part in that history played by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.              DakhaBrakha, Ukraine DakhaBrakha are one of the most sonically inventive contemporary groups in any genre \u2013 and certainly possessors of the tallest matching hats. Three of the four members are women and, with their alternately tuned, cello-centric sound, they have wowed audiences across the world at major festivals such as Glastonbury and WOMADelaide. That violence has rent their homeland since 2014 makes the celebration of freedom expressed within their music all the more potent. Entry point: The avant garde nature of their work bears more in common with Radiohead or Tyler the Creator than what many people might stereotypically expect when they hear the words \u201cworld music\u201d.              Omar Souleyman, Syria It is estimated that Souleyman has released more than 500 bootleg albums throughout the Middle East, and his champions include the DJ and producer Diplo (MIA, Bad Bunny) and Bj\u00f6rk. The exiled singer trades in modern electronic party music but the terror that has ripped across Syria for a decade now adds another layer of depth to his work. Entry point: The unforced cool and humor in Omar\u2019s music have translated powerfully to alternative music fans worldwide, particularly in the EDM community.              OOIOO, Japan Incorporating traditional instruments, this all female post-rock band makes some of the most unclassifiable music out there. The group has roots in the Japanese noise rock pioneers the Boredoms, for whom frontwoman Yoshimi P-We was the drummer and trumpeter. P-We\u2019s output over the past four decades has been staggering, traversing dozens of releases from more than eight different groups. She has collaborated with the Flaming Lips for an album, and also with members of Pavement and Sonic Youth. Entry point: Not through volume but ingenuity, OOIOO rock harder than a herd of death metal headbangers.              The Good Ones, Rwanda In 2009 I met and produced this acoustic roots trio of genocide survivors who went on to become the first artists to widely release original songs internationally in the Kinyarwanda language. They have since gained fans worldwide including members of Wilco, Sleater-Kinney, Fugazi, TV on the Radio and My Bloody Valentine, as well as Robert Plant and Glen Hansard. Despite touring the US, the UK and mainland Europe, the group continues to battle poverty and live without running water or electricity. Disturbingly, the press announcement for the Grammys\u2019 global category name change this past November indicated an unexplained desire to distance the award from \u201cfolk\u201d \u2013 this, despite the fact that more than 56% of those in Africa (and 83% of Rwandans) continuing to live rurally. Entry point: With the musicians\u2019 rural and remote hilltop origins, the harmonic similarities to US bluegrass vocals are often eerie. Their leader, Adrien Kazigira, is one of the greatest roots writers in the world, in any language \u2013 deserving a place beside such post-Dylan writers as Jason Isbell, Vic Chesnutt and Lucinda Williams.              Rachid Taha, Algeria Taha, who died in 2018, was a legendary Ra\u00ef music rock star. His lyrics were often outspoken against France\u2019s treatment of foreigners and the post-colonial Algerian government. His song Migra (Spanish slang for immigration patrol) was recorded by Santana, and Taha collaborated with Mick Jones of the Clash and Brian Eno. Entry point: Rachid was a rocker through and through but always on his own regional musical terms.              9Bach, Wales One of the Grammys\u2019 global music category mandates is to represent Celtic language and music, but the Chieftains are the only Celtic group ever to win, and it was for an album of Galician music from northern Spain that featured Latin music guests including Los Lobos and Cuba\u2019s Pancho Amat. 9Bach are an experimental female-fronted group who perform in Welsh; their track Deryn features none other than Peter Gabriel. Addressing the challenges faced by non-English singing artists, their founder, Lisa J\u00ean, has said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few queries asking, \u2018Why do we sing in Welsh when we could make more money singing in English?\u2019 The answer is Welsh is my first language \u2026 and language comes hand-in-hand with your landscape, your culture, and the stories you tell.\u201d Entry point: 9Bach create an immediate sense of place in their music, which emanates the splendour and mist of their homeland.              Fanfare Cioc\u0103rlia, Romania A raucous Roma institution, this year Fanfare Cioc\u0103rlia celebrate their 25th anniversary. Their 12-piece brass band sound has frequently been sampled by the Berlin-based Balkan Beats genre, and was even featured in the latest Borat film. Entry point: Ditching the forced zaniness of so many horn-driven bands, Fanfare Cioc\u0103rlia dive straight into the heart of organized chaos.              Da Arabian MCs, Israel The godfathers of Arabic rap, DAM\u2019s post-9/11 single Who\u2019s the Terrorist? helped spark a Middle Eastern musical movement. The collective of Palestinians from Israel features a female rapper/singer, Maysa Daw, and actively advocates women\u2019s rights. Entry point: Da Arabian MCs routinely demonstrate the in-on-the-joke intelligence that heightened the work of such artists as the Beastie Boys and Nicki Minaj \u2013 and, unlike so many international hip-hop groups, the vocals are not rote cadences of US rap.              Luzmila Carpio, Bolivia This 72-year-old has been described as \u201cone of the most important figures in Latin American music of the last 50 years\u201d. Despite being pressured to sing in Spanish at a young age, Carpio chose to sing in her mother tongue, Quechua. She has steadfastly used her music as an expression of rebellion against the predominance of western cultures over Indigenous ones. She says she \u201cborrows\u201d many melodies from birds and even incorporates bird calls when performing, as an almost analog sampling technique. Her voice has been compared to a \u201cviolin\u201d and Rolling Stone named her latest album, Yuyay Jap\u2019ina Tapes, \u201cone of 10 best Latin albums of the year\u201d. Entry point: Listen for the high notes. Her voice is acrobatic, bearing more of a resemblance to opera than most traditional folk music.              Thomas Mapfumo, Zimbabwe Known as \u201cthe Lion of Zimbabwe\u201d, Mapfumo was imprisoned without charge due to his outspoken opposition to British colonial rule. Now 75, he is credited with creating the Chimurenga music genre. In 2018 he returned to Zimbabwe after being exiled in the US for two decades. Entry point: Mapfumo translates traditional thumb-piano music into big band dance parties.              Huun-Huur-Tu, Tuva These throat-singing legends create otherworldly sounds via overlapping vocal overtones. Over four decades the quartet have collaborated with the likes of Frank Zappa, Kronos Quartet, the US blues legend Johnny \u201cGuitar\u201d Watson and the Chieftains. Entry point: The trance elements in Huun-Huur-Tu\u2019s sound make for perfect headphone music. When they drop down deep into their voices, it is as though they come from the depths of the Earth.              Mashrou\u2019 Leila, Lebanon This emotionally charged and innovative group features a self-identifying LGBTQ member in their lead singer, Hamed Sinno \u2013 something unheard of in the global category\u2019s history. The quartet have released six records since 2009, often dealing with same-sex love in songs such as Shim el Yasmine and Tayf (Ghost), about a shuttered gay club in Beirut. The first performers to display a gay pride flag in Lebanon, Mashrou\u2019 Leila have since been banned from performing in their own country, as well as in Egypt due to seven members of their audience being arrested \u2013 with one person sentenced to six years in prison for raising a rainbow flag at a 2017 concert.              \u2022 Ian Brennan is a Grammy-winning music producer, whose latest book is Silenced by Sound: The Music Meritocracy Myth.

It featured on the floor and round the doorways of the set the models walked through.

Brighton and Hove city council gave the green light for the heated Olympic-size pool on Wednesday. It will be built on Madeira Drive, in Kemptown, not far from the historic Volk\u2019s Electric Railway and a few minutes\u2019 walk from Brighton\u2019s Palace Pier. For the past two summers, this stretch of pebble beach has been the site of a fitness-hub pop-up, operated by Sea Lanes, with an indoor endless-pool training facility \u2013 that allows swimming against an adjustable current \u2013 a beach cafe and bar, and converted horse-box saunas. Brighton-based adventure tour operator SwimTrek has been running guided open-water swims from the beach and the operator will base its headquarters at the new beachfront pool site. The Grade II-listed Madeira Terrace, whose cast-iron seafront arches stretch from the Brighton aquarium colonnade to where the pool will be, was built as a covered promenade for tourists when the electric railway opened in 1883. Over the past decade its 151 arches have fallen into disrepair and the terrace was fenced off in 2016.     The dilapidated Madeira Terrace on Brighton seafront lies fenced off.

In February the council voted in favour of a budget amendment for an additional \u00a33.65m cash injection for Madeira Terrace. \u201cAs we understand it, the first phase of restoration, to restore 30 arches, will begin this October and we hope that the investment that we are making in this part of Brighton will shine a spotlight on it,\u201d said Sea Lanes director Joe McNulty.

Since the first lockdown, the Outdoor Swimming Society (OSS) has seen website traffic increase by 46% (785,000 visitors) and membership by 36%. Local wild swim groups report a 50-500% growth, with open-water lakes reporting up to a 1,000-fold increase in visitor numbers. OSS founder Kate Rew said wild swimming had reached a tipping point. \u201cWith pools shut and people looking for outdoor exercise close to home, thousands of people have made this the time to embrace rivers, lakes and the sea.\u201d She added: \u201cBrighton has a huge swimming culture and this new pool will help drive nationwide aquatics forward.

While party infighting was dominating headlines, local activists were campaigning to make the catchphrase a reality in cities across the US. Since the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor prompted unprecedented uprisings, some racial justice groups have successfully pressured municipal lawmakers to cut police funds and reinvest the money in services. And with reformed 2021 budgets coming into effect, cities are slowly beginning to redistribute law enforcement money to housing, mental health programs, food access and other programs. \u201cWe are showing the country how reinvestments from the police budget can actually make many people\u2019s lives so much better and safer,\u201d said Gregorio Casar, a councilmember in Austin, Texas, who helped pass a major cut to the city\u2019s law enforcement budget and is now reallocating those dollars to housing programs. \u201cThis will build momentum for changes to police budgets across the country.\u201d   Related: Rodney King: 30 years after brutal beating, activists say LAPD 'still corrupt and violent'    More than 20 major cities have reduced their police budgets in some form, an unprecedented trend, though the scale and circumstances vary dramatically. The activists who have long campaigned to take money from US police are now fighting to ensure that the initial cuts are only the start \u2013 and that a growing backlash from law enforcement, elected officials and some community groups  does not derail their progress. A \u2018paradigm shift\u2019: $870m cut from police For years, local advocacy groups have packed city hall meetings, demanding \u201cjobs not jails\u201d, \u201ccare not cops\u201d and \u201cbooks not bars\u201d \u2013 urging officials to stop expanding budgets for police and jails. They have argued that cities should instead prioritize the programs that have been defunded over the years that would address root causes of crime and poverty, like education, healthcare and homeless services. Local lawmakers largely ignored activists\u2019 pleas, and police spending has tripled over the last 40 years, helping to make the US a world leader in incarceration and police killings. Even as cities have faced financial shortfalls, local governments consistently spent an increasing share of their general funds on police (despite repeated research showing that increasing police funding does not correlate to reduced crime). The dynamics suddenly changed last summer during massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations after video emerged of a Minneapolis officer pressing his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes.     Protesters gather in front of the State Capitol on 7 June 2020, in Austin, Texas, during a protest over the death of George Floyd. Photograph: Ricardo B Brazziell/AP    \u201cEveryone on the street provided a new window into understanding and defining the problem of police brutality,\u201d said Nikki Jones, a professor of African American studies at the University of California, Berkeley, who described a \u201cparadigm shift\u201d in conservations about police and systemic racism. Previously, she explained, political debates focused on \u201cbad apples\u201d and \u201cimplicit bias\u201d \u2013 the ideas that brutality cases were isolated incidents and that law enforcement could be reformed with better training. But the uprisings brought mainstream attention to abolitionist arguments that the problems are institutional, and that the only way to reduce harm is to take power and funding away from police. With public pressure on them, mayors and city councils responded. In 2020 budget votes, advocacy groups won over $840m in direct cuts from US police departments and at least $160m investments in community services, according to an analysis by Interrupting Criminalization, an initiative at the Barnard Center for Research on Women. In 25 cities, such as Denver and Oakland, officials moved to remove police from schools, saving an additional $34m. \u201cFolks might look at $840m as a drop in the bucket of the $100bn we spend on police each year, but it definitely reverses the trend of constantly increasing police budgets over the past many decades,\u201d said Andrea J Ritchie, one of the Barnard researchers, \u201cand it did so in a way that also secured the transfer of funds from policing to community-based safety strategies.\u201d In some cases, the cuts came from leaving vacant positions unfilled or moving the accounting of certain police functions to other agencies \u2013 changes that would probably have minimal immediate impact. Other city leaders said their cuts were due to the Covid-19 economic crisis and not the protests, and in 26 major cities, lawmakers continued to increase police budgets.     A demonstrator raises their fist at a protest over the death of George Floyd near the White House. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP    But for cities that did intentionally pass cuts, some of the changes were significant. Portland, Oregon, cut $15m from its budget and disbanded a gun violence reduction unit and transit team that had both long been accused of over-policing Black communities. San Francisco officials pledged to divest $120m from police over two years with plans to invest in health programs and workforce training. Minneapolis is using police cuts to launch a mental health team to respond to certain 911 calls. New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, Baltimore and a dozen other cities have all also reduced police spending. And some of these cities are now demonstrating the impacts of their new budgets. How Austin is spending police funds Austin, Texas, has made some of the most dramatic changes in the country, directly cutting roughly $20m from the police department, and moving $80m from the agency by shifting certain services out of law enforcement. The city has gone from spending 40% of its $1.1bn general fund on police to now allocating about 26% to law enforcement. \u201cPublic health and public safety are at the heart of this,\u201d said Chris Harris, the criminal justice director at Texas Appleseed, a local not-for-profit. \u201cWhen we take policing away, we are actually filling that void with alternatives that we know are going to help.\u201d   Austin police budget cuts Sankey diagram   The Austin police funds were reallocated to emergency medical services for Covid-19, community medics, mental health first responders, services for homeless people, substance abuse programs, food access, workforce development, abortion services, victim support, parks and more. The city council is using money saved from the police budget to buy two hotels to provide supportive housing for homeless residents. \u201cFor decades, Austin has spent so many dollars policing homelessness, jailing the homeless, and paying for emergency rooms and 911 calls instead of reinvesting those same dollars to finally start reducing homelessness,\u201d said Casar, the local councilmember. \u201cBy adjusting the police budget even just a little bit, we are going to be able to house and help hundreds of people with these two hotels \u2026 and I hope we\u2019ll be able to buy more.\u201d Austin has started redirecting certain 911 calls to mental health professionals \u2013 a move meant to provide help to those crises instead of a potentially deadly response by police, Casar said: \u201cWe know that we can solve the mental health crisis with treatment and care, not with handcuffs and jail.\u201d The redirected funds are also meant to benefit the crime victims who have been traditionally neglected and mistreated by law enforcement, advocates said. Marina Garrett, a 25-year-old Austin resident and supporter of the defund efforts, has spoken out about how police mishandled her rape case. After she reported that she was sexually assaulted in 2015 at age 19, she submitted to a forensic exam, but detectives didn\u2019t move forward while awaiting results for her rape kit, which was affected by a huge backlog.    We can\u2019t just keep throwing money at police and expect them to change their ways and culture  Marina Garrett     During that time, the police forensic lab shut down amid claims of misconduct and incompetence, and Garrett\u2019s case dragged on: \u201cIt was completely devastating. You wake up every day, and it\u2019s all you can think about. My whole life was on pause for two years.\u201d It took two years for the results to come back, and ultimately police and prosecutors did not move forward with a case: \u201cI started to realize that police were no help \u2026 and that police were making survivors wish they had not come forward,\u201d said Garrett, who is part of a class-action lawsuit against Austin police. With reinvested police funds, Austin is now moving forward with a new independent forensic science department. Garrett and other survivors have long pushed for the change. She said it was a small step to reduce some of police\u2019s jurisdiction over sexual assault survivors, but that law enforcement remained largely ill-equipped to support victims.  \u201cWe can\u2019t just keep throwing money at police and expect them to change their ways and culture, which is sexist and racist,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are groups that are trained to provide support to survivors and help them find healing and justice, separate and apart from police.\u201d Alicia Dean, a city spokesperson, declined to comment on Garrett\u2019s case, but said the police department supported the change in forensics, adding in a statement, \u201cthe city is committed to improving best practices and outcomes of sexual assault reporting, processing, investigations and prosecutions. We want all victims to feel safe, heard and have confidence in every step of the process.\u201d Fighting the backlash and \u2018fear mongering\u2019 One of the greatest obstacles to defunding law enforcement agencies are powerful police unions, which have long opposed reforms and negotiated strong protections in their contracts that typically make it impossible for cities to terminate or lay off officers. Unions have launched aggressive PR campaigns to counter the movement. In Austin, the Texas Municipal Police Association (TMPA) created highway billboards saying \u201cWarning! Austin Police Defunded, Enter at Your Own Risk\u201d and \u201cLimited Support Next 20 Miles\u201d \u2013 and put up the signs in September, before the new budget had gone into effect. The Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has also repeatedly threatened to try to force Austin to restore its police budget through legislation, and other state Republicans have spread misinformation about crime rates in the city.     Greg Abbott speaks at a news conference before signing a \u2018Texas backs the blue pledge\u2019 at the Austin Police Association, 10 September 2020. Photograph: Jay Janner/AP    \u201cThere are attempts to play up perceived dangers and to associate it with changes in the budget, without evidence,\u201d said Harris. \u201cA lot of the fearmongering that comes out of law enforcement is designed to play up racial tensions and racist myths.\u201d Cities across the US that have made modest progress on defunding are facing similar resistance. In Seattle, councilmembers initially pledged to meet activists\u2019 demands and cut the police budget by 50%, but ultimately backtracked amid intense police opposition, passing a reduction of about 18% (by leaving vacancies unfilled and moving certain functions, like parking enforcement, out of the police budget). Councilmember Kshama Sawant, a socialist who supported the 50% defunding, said it was particularly disappointing for the city to maintain high rates of police spending in a budget that made cuts to affordable housing, parks, libraries and transportation. Communities of color hurt by those cuts are the same people most targeted by police violence, she added.    A lot of the fearmongering that comes out of law enforcement is designed to play up racial tensions and racist myths  Chris Harris     \u201cTens of thousands of people in our city are reeling from the Covid crisis and the recession,\u201d she told the Guardian, \u201cbut we have no hiring freeze for police.\u201d Sad\u00e9 A Smith, a Seattle civil rights attorney, said it was hard to see the budget changes get watered down: \u201cWhile they are playing these bureaucratic games, people are suffering. That\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating. It took so many days of marching and an unprecedented uprising to even get this little bit.\u201d While there has been aggressive resistance to defunding from law enforcement associations and elected allies, there are also community organizations and local residents who have expressed doubts or concerns. The Rev Harriet Walden, a Seattle advocate who has long fought for police accountability, said she was worried about rising crime rates and feared defunding efforts could leave some Black communities and victims of violence vulnerable: \u201cCrime is escalating \u2026 and people aren\u2019t going to get arrested or charged.\u201d Walden said she supported reforms that made it easier to fire officers who violate policies or brutalize people, but that she didn\u2019t want fewer police overall.

Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images    Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, the teenager killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer, also said she would rather see more police officers with better standards, instead of defunded departments. Merchants and business groups, too, have organized against defunding in some cities. Ritchie, the Barnard researcher, noted that the activists leading the local defunding efforts were survivors of violence themselves and that they have made significant progress doing outreach and education, explaining to residents that \u201ccities have for years been defunding housing, healthcare, job programs, libraries, arts and culture and violence prevention programs\u201d. People are often supportive once they understand that defunding police is about re-funding those services and making proactive investments in public safety and health. Activists across different cities were also learning from each other and recently launched a national website to pool together resources and put them in a better position to push for changes in the upcoming budget cycle, she said. \u201cOrganizers are better prepared and armed with shared strategies and much bolder and more detailed visions.\u201d \u201cFolks are getting ready and coming back for much, much more.\u201d", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Sean Paul's teenage obsessions: 'My Coventry grandmother cooked me bubble and squeak'", "full_article": "Swimming and water polo When I turned 13 my father had just gone to prison, so without a father figure I looked for heroes in music and sports. Both my parents had been champion swimmers and when I was four or five they would throw me in the water when other kids didn\u2019t want to swim. From the age of 13 to 21 I represented Jamaica in water polo, which my father had played. We trained a lot: 5,000 metres a day, 7,000 to 9,000 metres on Thursdays. It consumed my life but in a good way. It took my mind off my father being in prison. Water polo is one of the most physically demanding sports, and there\u2019s a lot that goes on under the water that people don\u2019t see. Hitting, thumping, kicking, tugging \u2026 all while you\u2019re trying to breathe and stay alive and catch a ball and shoot! It\u2019s a really rough sport. In the national team, we were trained by a Hungarian coach who called us pimps. \u201cYou pimps don\u2019t know anything!\u201d His compliments would be stuff like: \u201cMan, you\u2019re swimming like a horse today.\u201d So I was a pimp, but a horse [laughs]. Eventually my focus turned to music but, after my father died two years ago, I started to play water polo again, to feel closer to him. Casio keyboard When I was 15 I saw [reggae production duo] Steely and Clevie on TV talking about how they used a computer to programme the sounds. They didn\u2019t need a big studio or a band. After that, I wanted to become a producer. I saw a keyboard with a crack in it going cheap in a flea market and begged my mother to buy it for me. I lasted one term in piano lessons, but could pick out a tune and play it. The Casio keyboard had one conga drum, a kick drum, a hi-hat and a snare, but that was enough for me to recreate the rhythms of people like Steely and Clevie or Sly and Robbie, and sing over them. I had a cassette player so would press \u201crecord\u201d and use the keyboard to build a rhythm, play bass and spit lyrics. Primitive recording! Then my brother got in with a sound system. In Jamaica, on the back of the 45 single, they would have the \u201cversion\u201d [dub]. So I\u2019d sing over those. I was 16, 17, and, while I didn\u2019t get a record out until I was 24, that\u2019s how I started. Nicole Wynter              In my teens, having a girlfriend was a big thing. I\u2019d have one, break up. I\u2019d have another, we\u2019d break up. I don\u2019t know if you could call it infidelity at the boyfriend-girlfriend stage, but in my late teens that\u2019s what led to the breakups. When I was 14 to 15, though, my first girlfriend, Nicole Wynter, was the whole love and marriage thing, what you\u2019d call puppy love. We\u2019d go to the movies, start necking, find out stuff. After we broke up, we remained close friends, but sadly when we were both 17 she passed away with a brain tumour. I sing about her in the song Never Gonna Be the Same and there\u2019s a picture of her in the video. When she got sick, I just didn\u2019t know how to react. I always feel bad that I wasn\u2019t there for her in the last stages, but I couldn\u2019t handle seeing her like that. After she died, I saw her in one or two dreams and she was OK, smiling at me. I felt better after that. She was special to me. Conscious lyrics My teens were very up and down, with my father in prison and my girlfriend passing away. Between 13 and 15, I was taken out of private school and sent to Wolmer\u2019s, the \u201cruffians\u2019 school\u201d in Kingston. When I was 17, my mother had a nervous breakdown and couldn\u2019t walk properly, so I had a lot of responsibility. Music became my outlet. As a middle-class, uptown kid, I had always been told that dancehall music was not for us, but I just gravitated to it and became more aware of my surroundings. Growing up, I saw poverty, people suffering unnecessarily, and I would think about people having a harder time than myself and that helped me cope. I started writing conscious lyrics, trying to show the differences between uptown and downtown Jamaica and highlighting prejudices. I\u2019d be singing about that stuff, but later on producers would be like: \u201cBro, this doesn\u2019t seem like you.\u201d They wanted me to sing more about girls and partying, which I was into, too, but part of me got stifled by the party guy, who attracted the ladies and made more money. I was trying to establish myself, so pretty soon I thought: \u201cI like this party guy.\u201d Bob Marley and the Wailers              I have known Bob Marley\u2019s music all my life \u2013 in Jamaica, the Wailers are like our Beatles. We get played the nice songs, such as One Love, which are amazing, but between 17 and 19 I got more into the more conscious material \u2013 the revolutionary music, or sad songs such as Jah Live. I started to think about roots music. My favourite Marley song is Natural Mystic. I love the way the bassline starts out of nowhere, and it really feels mystical, like a supernatural power to me. I also love Mr Brown, a song from when Marley was younger, which is really funky. We\u2019ve lost a few people in reggae recently: Bunny Wailer, U-Roy, the great engineer Barry O\u2019Hare, and Toots Hibbert from the Maytals, who hugged me every year on tour and really encouraged me. Those names were iconic figures to me. I shed tears for all of them and will try to keep their memory alive in whatever ways I can. Their times will be cherished and they will be missed. English fish and chips My grandmother is from Coventry, and when it was bombed during the second world war, she came out of the air-raid shelter to find that her home was one of only three left standing. They moved to Rugby and she got a job in a drawing office, drawing plane parts for the war, working when she was 14. She met my Chinese-Jamaican grandfather after he went to study in England, she came to Jamaica in the late 40s and has lived here ever since. In my teens, she would cook me English food, such as bubble and squeak. She told me that fish and chips are best when served in a newspaper, smothered in vinegar, when the print comes off in your hands. When she told me stories about England, it always seemed so far away and we didn\u2019t have the money for me to go there, but when I first went to Brixton it was just like Jamaica: spicy food and music! She always told me that she would love to go to the pyramids in Egypt, so after I became successful, I made her dream come true.

A singer and guitarist, he hosted open-mic sessions in pubs around the borough of Richmond, inviting anyone to sing, play an instrument or recite poems. Seb was born in Calcutta. His father, David, was a BBC employee in India, his mother, Conchita Guaglione, a Brazilian-born Italian artist who had works exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Seb went to a nursery school in Calcutta, where he was once taught by Mother Teresa, before his family returned to the UK and he went to school in Fulham, London. Good-looking and with a cheeky grin, Seb left school to become an actor, settled in Richmond upon Thames and once appeared in a rep performance at the Richmond theatre in which Laurence Olivier starred. He went on to have roles in TV series including Doctor Who, The Return of Sherlock Holmes and The Citadel. His partner Cathy Bryant told me: \u201cHe actually received a small royalty cheque the week before he died, but sadly I was unable to tell him about it. He would have been chuffed.\u201d He was best known as open-mic music host in the Watermans Arms, an old-fashioned pub 50 yards from the River Thames named after the boatmen who used to drink there. Last orders would lead to wee hours\u2019 jam sessions at homes like mine, close to the pub.

He would open his sessions with one of his own favourites, often Billy Swan\u2019s I Can Help, whose lyrics summed up Seb\u2019s philosophy: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a problem, I don\u2019t care what it is, If you need a hand, I can assure you of this, I can help \u2026 \u201d And right up until Covid closed the pubs down, he would often close with a ray of cautious hope through Michael Nesmith\u2019s Rio: \u201cI probably won\u2019t fly down to Rio, but then again, I just might.\u201d Seb was also a decent songwriter, best known for his London Years.

In an open letter sent to the prime minister on Thursday, explorers, authors and sporting figures joined headteachers, councillors, charities and outdoor education providers to call for residential school trips to be allowed during the summer term, when hotels and B&amp;Bs are due to reopen in England. Among the 200 signatories are the former England rugby coach Sir Clive Woodward, the children\u2019s author Sir Michael Morpurgo, the Olympic gold medal winning canoeist Etienne Stott and the explorers Benedict Allen and Victoria Humphries. \u201cChildren and young people have been among those most impacted by the Covid pandemic,\u201d the letter says. \u201cAs we recover from this pandemic \u2026 outdoor education has to be part of the government\u2019s wider reopening of education, with both day and overnight visits allowed to operate.\u201d With more than 2 million children a year usually taking part in outdoor education, the benefits to health and wellbeing are clear, the letter continues. But a ban on residential school trips since March 2020 has already led to 30 outdoor education centres closing permanently, with 6,000 job losses and \u00a3600m in lost revenue. The letter warns that unless providers can reopen at the same time as hotels from 17 May, the sector will face financial jeopardy, a further 10,000 jobs will be at risk and a generation of children could miss out on the often life-changing benefits of visits. Jim Whittaker, the chair of the Association of Heads of Outdoor Education Centres, said: \u201cWe can play a vital role in helping children get back on track to achieve their potential, but we need help to do so. The pandemic has been financially disastrous for outdoor education. But just as schools and children need us most, our sector is in an incredibly precarious situation. Without urgent action we face the devastating loss of provision for ever.\u201d Disadvantaged pupils and those with special needs, for whom these visits are often a unique experience, stand to lose the most. Andy Robinson, the chief executive of the Institute for Outdoor Learning, said: \u201cThese are often life-changing experiences which, by their very nature, cannot take place in the classroom. If we are to rebuild the resilience and self-confidence of this generation of children we need to start that process as soon as possible.\u201d Around 1.4 million children are on free school meals, and at least that many are unlikely to be able to have these experiences apart from on a school trip, Robinson added. \u201cThe industry is desperate to do what we do best: helping children fulfil their potential, whatever their background.\u201d Sean Day, the centre director at the Lake District Calvert Trust, said: \u201cWe specialise in providing life-changing residential trips for children and adults with disabilities. If you can complete a high-ropes course in your wheelchair or abseil down a 30ft Lake District crag, then everyday challenges at home can become far less daunting. \u201cIf we can\u2019t reopen this summer, the future of this amazing charity is at risk, and it is children with disabilities who will suffer. We are desperate for schools to come back.\u201d Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is due to decide soon when school trips can safely reopen. The School Travel Stakeholder Group, which represents providers of outdoor education, last week proposed a fixed reopening date of 17 May for day and overnight school visits. Under the proposals, centres would adhere to new Covid-secure protocols and ensure all visits adhere to the government\u2019s school bubble requirements. \u201cWe are ready to play our part in the recovery and believe that the Covid-safe protocols that we have developed will enable us to open safely,\u201d said Whittaker. \u201cWe have put in place so many safety measures to ensure we can operate with everything that schools and hotels do and more. We opened over the summer to families and didn\u2019t have a single recorded case.\u201d The letter also calls for a \u00a350m culture recovery fund for school travel providers. A petition calling on the government to provide financial support to the sector has had nearly 15,000 signatures. A Government spokesperson said: \u201cThroughout the pandemic we have kept our guidance on both residential and non-residential visits under review, in line with Public Health England advice.

The FTSE 100 manufacturer revealed it burned through \u00a34.2bn in cash during the year as revenues from servicing passenger aircraft collapsed. It expects to burn through a further \u00a32bn this year, but Warren East, Rolls-Royce\u2019s chief executive, raised hopes that the company would generate cash once more in 2022 as flying recovers. \u201cThe worst is behind us as far as Covid is concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is cause to be optimistic about a V-shaped recovery,\u201d he added, citing \u201cvery encouraging\u201d data on vaccines against the coronavirus. Rolls-Royce\u2019s revenues were among the most vulnerable to the pandemic because of its reliance on making and servicing jet engines for passenger aircraft. In the year before the pandemic its civil aerospace business brought in \u00a38bn in revenues, compared with \u00a35bn in 2020. The underlying loss before tax of \u00a34bn compared with a profit of \u00a3583m the year before. The underlying loss partly reflected charges related to financing foreign exchange as it adjusted to lower than expected dollar earnings. Losses before tax for 2020 were \u00a32.9bn, including \u00a31.4bn in write-offs and nearly \u00a3500m in redundancy costs. Rolls-Royce scrambled last year to cut costs and raise cash when the extent of the pandemic became clear. That included cutting 7,000 jobs out of 19,000 across its global civil aerospace division, in what it said was the largest restructuring in the company\u2019s recent history. East described it as a \u201cprogramme of self-help\u201d, reducing the number of UK manufacturing sites from 11 to only five. It has also negotiated two-week shutdowns of its engine factories this summer in an effort to save more cash. The hours flown by planes with Rolls-Royce engines slumped to 43% of 2019 levels. In 2021, hours flown are expected to improve only gradually, to 55% of 2019 levels. Rolls-Royce said it expected earnings to accelerate in the second half of this year, but even during 2022 it expected flying hours to be a fifth lower than 2019 as the slow recovery in international travel continues, in part because of new variants of the virus. It had previously expected 2022 flying hours to reach 90% of 2019 levels. Deliveries of new engines are not expected to recover significantly for a \u201cfew years\u201d. However, even at 80% of 2019 flying hours Rolls-Royce would be able to generate \u00a3750m in cash during 2022, East said. A \u201creasonable worst case\u201d scenario of 70% cash generation would be \u00a3300m lower, and it has \u00a33.5bn of cash and \u00a35.5bn of unused credit lines to see it through if conditions worsen. \u201cUnless something fairly catastrophic happens we will be cashflow-positive,\u201d East said. He revealed plans to gradually raise investment in lower-carbon technologies. By 2023, Rolls-Royce plans to devote 20% of its research and development budget to small modular reactors, hybrid, hydrogen and electric power technologies, as part of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. It currently invests about 7% in lower-carbon technology.

However, East said he believed that the pandemic had made spending on decarbonisation easier. \u201cWe\u2019ll see that the pandemic has accelerated the journey because it has sensitised people to their relationship with the environment,\u201d he said. Rolls-Royce has not committed to making all of its products net zero. Instead it is relying the airline industry to dramatically increase the use of synthetic fuels made using carbon from the air. Those fuels would add net zero carbon to the atmosphere.

Shell had argued that it was not responsible. \n \n  Related: 'Mollah\u2019s life was typical': the deadly ship graveyards of Bangladesh  \n \nIn a second landmark ruling, the supreme court ruled in 2019 that Zambian villagers could sue UK-based mining conglomerate Vedanta in the English courts for alleged water pollution because, as the parent body of the mining company working in Zambia, it owed the villagers a duty of care and could be held responsible. \nAn estimated 216 workers have died in the past 15 years at the shipbreaking yards of Chittagong, including seven so far this year. Many more have been disabled or seriously injured. \nWork in Chittagong is well-known for being precarious, dirty and dangerous, but shipping companies have been able to avoid responsibility by changing ownership of vessels at the last minute, and using tax havens and middlemen. \nHundreds of people, mostly without contracts, are injured or die every year in falls, explosions and accidents. The coastal environment is heavily polluted with oils, asbestos and dangerous chemicals and few people can work for more than a few years in the intense tropical heat without being physically injured. \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    A year on from the start of the world\u2019s biggest health crisis, we now face a human rights pandemic.

The result, it argued, is that wealthy shipowners get the highest prices for scrap vessels in the practical certainty that they will be broken up in Bangladesh where health and safety standards are lower than in more expensive but safer yards. \nMaran argued that it did not control the ship\u2019s ultimate destination and that there was nothing it could have, or should have, done to avoid the risks to the deceased. But Lord Justice Coulson said: \u201c\u2026 the appellant could, and should, have insisted on the sale to a so-called \u2018green\u2019 yard, where proper working practices were in place\u201d. \nAccording to NGO Shipbreaking Platform, more than 70% of approximately 800 vessels that reach the end of their operating lives every year are broken up in Bangladesh, India or Pakistan. \nStandard practice is that sales of end-of-life ships are not conducted directly between shipowners and shipbreakers themselves, but through demolition cash buyers who assume the credit risk, with the result that shipowners are distanced. \nLeigh Day director Martyn Day welcomed the appeal court decision. \u201cThe English courts have been shown to be sympathetic to these claims by communities whether in Africa or Asia bringing claims against British multinationals. \n\u201cWhether it is oil-spill claims against Shell, mine pollution claims against Vedanta or this claim in relation to shipbreaking, London has proved to be one of, if not the only, capitals in the world where claims can successfully be brought,\u201d he said.", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Fiorentina 0-5 Manchester City (Agg: 0-8): Women's Champions League last 16 \u2013 as it happened", "full_article": "  3.24pm GMT    Match report: Fiorentina 0-5 Manchester City (Agg: 0-8)    Women\u2019s Champions League: Ellen White and Sam Mewis bagged a brace each as Manchester City booked their place in the quarter-finals with a minimum of fuss.

Unselfishly, she elects to square the ball instead of shoot and Sam Mewis fires home from close range in the face of utterly hapless defending. The final whistle can\u2019t come soon enough for these Fiorentina players, who look thoroughly demoralised.      Mewis scores again.

The idea is good, the execution less so. Her pass is intercepted and City are back in possession.        2.14pm GMT       55 min: Ellen White elects not to head an inviting cross from the left goalwards, mindful of the fact that in doing so she would almost certainly clatter into the goal-post and possibly do herself a mischief.

It breaks down when the Italian side\u2019s Irish international Louise Quinn beats Kelly to a 50-50 ball with a crunching tackle. It was above board, but a nice get-to-know-you for the substitute. She felt that!        2.06pm GMT       48 min: City pick up where they left off - emphatically on the front foot.

Swiss referee Esther Staubli draws the first half to a close with barely a moment of added time. It\u2019s been a profitable 45 minutes for City, who have doubled their lead from the first leg. Ellen White bagged a brace either side of a Caroline Weir penalty to put the tie well beyond the Italians.        1.45pm GMT       43 min: A good move from Fiorentina on the break, with Thogersen on the ball. She plays it into the path of Sara Baldi in the City penalty area, but under pressure from defenders, Baldi toe-pokes an excellent chance wide of the left upright.        1.43pm GMT       42 min: Stanway gives the ball away cheaply again, but City soon get it back. FIorentina are really struggling to keep hold of the ball on the rare occasions they get it.        1.42pm GMT       41 min: A promising City attack breaks down when Georgia Stanway sends a rogue pass out over the touchline for a Fiorentina throw-in.        1.40pm GMT       39 min: Esme Morgan is very, very lucky to avoid a booking for a cynical tug on Sabatino.

You\u2019ve still got to go out and do a professional job and make sure you give yourself the best possible chance. \u201cNo matter who I pick tomorrow, we\u2019ll make sure that happens. Sometimes when you\u2019ve got nothing to lose you can see a team come out and be a little bit braver.

Leading the final debate in the Scottish parliament on Thursday, Scotland\u2019s justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, assured MSPs that the legislation balanced protections for victims of hate crime with safeguarding freedom of expression, stating that the rigorous consideration of the bill had \u201cshown the very best of parliament\u201d. The final vote was delayed from Wednesday, after a marathon five-hour debate over a lengthy series of amendments resulted in one of Holyrood\u2019s latest sittings and concluded the rocky passage of the bill. It is intended to consolidate existing hate crime laws but also creates a new offence of \u201cstirring up hatred\u201d on the grounds of religion, sexual orientation, age, disability or transgender identity. On Wednesday, an amendment to add sex to this list of protected characteristics at this stage was voted down, after MSPs cross-party raised concerns about why women were excluded. The former Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont argued that the case for including women \u2013 \u201cwho understand hate crime more than any other group does\u201d \u2013 was \u201cindisputable\u201d. An independent working group was established last month, led by Helena Kennedy, to consider whether the creation of a standalone offence or adding sex to the list of other protected characteristics would better tackle misogynist abuse. But Lamont said it was wrong to \u201coutsource our thinking to a working group, rather than wrestle with the issues of principle here in the parliament\u201d. Joan McAlpine, who broke with the SNP whip on a number of amendments, told colleagues that she was particularly concerned that the definition of transgender identity includes cross-dressers: \u201cIt will seem bizarre to many people that men who enjoy cross-dressing are protected from hate crime, but women are not.\u201d But Yousaf urged MSPs to listen to women\u2019s organisations, including Scottish Women\u2019s Aid and Rape Crisis Scotland, which warned that a neutral sex aggravator could become a tool for domestic abuse perpetrators to use as part of a wider pattern of coercive control. \u201cI ask members to give the working group the time that it needs to explore the issue, come forward with recommendations and create, potentially, a world-leading approach.\u201d Holyrood did vote to strengthen freedom of speech provisions in the bill, after earlier iterations provoked an outcry from religious and cultural groups. Yousaf accepted one amendment from the Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins, who is also convener of Holyrood\u2019s justice committee, which restated rights under ECHR Article 10 and emphasised the right to offend, shock or disturb, in relation to a reasonableness defence. Tomkins told MSPs: \u201cSo much fear has been stoked in relation to those matters that it is important to set that out. Criticising policy relating to transgender identity is not a hate crime under the bill. Even if you express yourself in a manner that others find transphobic, it is not a hate crime to discuss or to criticise matters relating to transgender identity\u201d. He added that clear explanation to the police and the public was now essential. Tomkins and fellow Conservative Liam Kerr failed to secure an amendment that they argued would protect disagreements, for example, at the family dinner table. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 March 2021 to remove part of a quote that incorrectly suggested people who cross-dress had not previously been among those offered protection under Scottish hate crime legislation.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Sally Heaney obituary", "full_article": "My wife, Sally Heaney, who has died aged 79, championed the movement towards child-centred education in the 1960s and 70s.

In 1975, while working in the education department of Chester College (now University of Chester), she established a playgroup there for disadvantaged children from the area. In order to enable children who could not get to the playgroup, she helped to transform an old double-decker bus into a playbus \u2013 so that the playgroup could travel to the children and be a mobile source of fun and pre-school learning. To help raise money for this project, Sally mobilised knitters from local neighbourhoods to create a giant Liverpool scarf.

Joe Biden, the US president, should aim for a national target of cutting emissions by about 60% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, for the world to have a good chance of holding global temperature rises within 1.5C of pre-industrial levels, according to Climate Action Tracker (CAT). Such a target would be substantially tougher than the halving of emissions by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, that many US civil society groups have espoused. Biden\u2019s top advisers are working on a national plan for emissions cuts, called a nationally determined contribution, or NDC \u2013 a requirement of the Paris agreement. John Kerry, Biden\u2019s climate chief, is expected to unveil the plan at a US-led climate summit on 22 April. CAT analyses countries\u2019 commitments against the Paris goals of holding global temperature rises to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aspiration of limiting the rise to 1.5C. The latest analysis, published on Thursday, shows that the US as the world\u2019s second biggest emitter, after China, must cut emissions by between 57% and 63% to remain within the lower limit. Biden has plans to ensure the US fully decarbonises power generation in the next 15 years, which CAT said was consistent with meeting the goals of the Paris agreement, and to move towards electric vehicles, though he has not set a firm timeline for the latter. The CAT analysis found nationwide sales of nearly all new light-duty vehicles must be electric by 2030, and that Biden should aim for cuts of 60% in emissions from residential buildings and 70% in emissions from commercial buildings, which would be tougher than Biden\u2019s current aims of halving emissions from buildings by 2030. Emissions cuts of 60% for the US would be a stretch, but should be achievable, according to Niklas H\u00f6hne of the NewClimate Institute, one of the two organisations behind Climate Action Tracker. \u201cIf you take climate change seriously, this is what [Biden] must do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a matter of political will.\u201d   Related: How grassroots schemes across UK are tackling climate crisis    He pointed to the rapid progress made in recent years on electric vehicles, and the plunging price of renewable energy. \u201cThings are possible now that we couldn\u2019t have imagined a few years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s possible to set visionary targets even if you don\u2019t know how to meet the last five or 10% [of the emissions cuts needed].\u201d Countries are already spending trillions on rescuing their economies from the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cNow is the moment, when a lot of money is being spent, to ensure it is being spent not just to support the economy but to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d he said. Biden has also made clear his commitment to a long-term target for the US of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, joining scores of other countries that have also announced a net zero target in recent months. Those long-term targets mean that countries responsible for a majority of global greenhouse gas emissions have now pledged to reach net zero around mid-century, a goal scientists say must be met to stay within 1.5C or 2C. However, few countries have short-term targets aligned with that mid-century target, or detailed plans on how to reach their goals. That is where NDCs, a requirement of the Paris agreement, come in. The deadline for submitting NDCs was last December, but about half of countries \u2013 including the US, China, India and other big emitters \u2013 missed the deadline owing to the pandemic. The UN recently published a report showing that the NDCs submitted so far would only result in a 1% fall in emissions, far below the levels needed. The UN now wants all countries to re-examine the NDCs they have submitted, and is urging those yet to come forward with NDCs to do so as soon as possible, ahead of a vital UN climate summit this November, called Cop26 and to be hosted by the UK in Glasgow. China, the world\u2019s biggest emitter, is also being closely watched. Last week, Beijing published the latest five-year plan, which sets out the government\u2019s economic blueprint for 2021 to 2025, but it merely reiterated an existing goal of peaking emissions by 2030. Green experts said that was too late to have a chance of meeting the Paris goals, and China may revise the goal in its NDC. John Murton, the UK government\u2019s envoy for Cop26, told a UK parliamentary committee on Thursday: \u201cWe are urging all countries to make commitments consistent with pathways to net zero.\u201d Nathaniel Keohane, senior-vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund in the US, said: \u201cAfter four years of the US going backwards on climate and falling behind, while the UK, EU, China and others moved ahead, this is the moment for the US to demonstrate leadership and set a stretch goal. What seems very clear from all the analyses that have been done to date is that the next target should start with a five. \u201cThat level of ambition would re-establish American leadership on climate, supercharge American competitiveness, and galvanise global climate action as we head into Cop26. And as a range of modelling analyses have shown, an NDC of at least 50% is well within reach, provided the Biden administration goes all-in on climate action.\u201d ", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Tell us: what is your most cherished mix tape?", "full_article": "The inventor of the cassette tape, Lou Ottens, has died aged of 94.

Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the overall picture was encouraging in the circumstances, adding: \u201cThere are, though, significant areas of concern, and the recent data on the continued poorer experience of ethnic minority staff starkly reminds NHS leaders that staff experience varies unacceptably in their organisations. \u201cWith the government once again reiterating its intention to offer only a 1% pay rise, there can be no room for complacency when the results also show that around a third of staff are considering leaving their jobs and nearly one in five are thinking of quitting the health service entirely.\u201d   Related: After an unrelenting year, stressed-out NHS staff deserve more than a clap | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett    At least 230 NHS staff have died from Covid, according to an ITV tally last month, with many more affected. In January, at the height of the second wave of the pandemic, Labour said there were 52,000 NHS staff off with the virus. A paper published in the BMJ in January said black and Asian staff represented 21% of the NHS workforce but early analysis showed that they accounted for 63% of deaths among health and social care workers. Dr Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS race and health observatory said: \u201cToday\u2019s results of the NHS staff survey reflect longstanding patterns of bullying and discrimination \u2026 Ethnic minority staff have been disproportionately affected over the last 12 months by Covid deaths and infections, along with other concerning factors such as the quality and availability of PPE, allocation to frontline Covid wards and risk assessments of variable quality.\u201d The survey, which received 595,270 responses out of more than 1.2 million NHS England employees, found that the proportion who said they said they often or always looked forward to going to work dropped to 58.7%, from 59.5%, while 73% said they were often or always enthusiastic about their job, almost two percentage points down on 2019. The survey results also illustrated how Covid has affected the jobs people are expected to do and the way they do them, with 18.5% of staff saying they had been redeployed due to the pandemic and 34.2% of staff saying they had worked on a Covid-19-specific ward or area at any time. Prerana Issar, chief people officer for the NHS, said: \u201cGiven the high level of work-related stress for staff caused by the pandemic, we need to maintain our focus on health and wellbeing and give them the support they need during recovery to help us to maintain care for patients.\u201d  The headline and standfirst of this article were changed on 11 March to reflect that the survey was of NHS staff in England and not NHS England staff.

We played with humility and maximum respect to Fiorentina,\u201d said Taylor. \u201cI thought the way we challenged balls, were professional and the way we managed the game from the first to the last minute was excellent.\u201d If there was any expectation that Fiorentina might be a danger on their home turf it was quickly squashed when City doubled their 3-0 advantage from the first leg within 32 minutes, before Mewis came on at half-time and added a fourth and fifth. Twice Lauren Hemp provided for White from the right and those two goals sandwiched a penalty scored by Caroline Weir.   Related: Chelsea into Champions League last eight after Atl\u00e9tico miss third penalty    The penalty award was harsh, with Esme Morgan\u2019s cross having ricocheted mostly off the face of the defender Martina Zanoli rather than her arm, but it was irrelevant in the broader scheme of things with City already four up on aggregate. In reaching the last 16 Fiorentina had gone one step further than last year, when they were knocked out by Arsenal in the previous round by an aggregate score of 6-0. However, with their league form having crumbled \u2013 they sit fifth in Serie A, 22 points behind the leaders, Juventus \u2013 any chance of an improvement in form against English opposition was slim. This was a ruthlessly clinical performance from City against a team that, at times, looked to be standing still as the ball was played around them. The visitors were without their captain, Steph Houghton, and Lucy Bronze, who were rested to recover from minor injuries. As they cruised into the quarter-finals, Taylor could also shuffle things further \u2013 at half-time Weir and Hemp were taken off, and the fresh legs of Chloe Kelly and Mewis came on. Keira Walsh, influential in defensive midfield, also made way for Laura Coombs, while White was taken off for the young academy graduate Millie Davies to make her Champions League debut, having featured for 43 minutes across four substitute appearances in the Women\u2019s Super League. \u201cWhat I love about this team is we make changes, we make tactical subs and it doesn\u2019t change the performance of the team,\u201d said Taylor.

My social media timelines are full of women who are distressed by Sarah\u2019s disappearance, and terrified that it could have been them. Men have asked what they can do to help women feel safer. But what\u2019s needed beyond the education of individuals are urgent political solutions to counter men\u2019s attempts to claim public spaces as their exclusive domain. The fear that we feel in public places is so common that many women consider it a fact of life. A recent survey for UN Women UK found that 80% of women of all ages in the UK said they had experienced sexual harassment in public spaces, of which men are overwhelmingly the perpetrators. While out running, I\u2019ve been chased by men, and it\u2019s rare that a week passes without random male passersby shouting derogatory comments or making noises at me. The joy I find in running is diminished by fear. This fear is grounded in the knowledge that harassment can precede assault or even murder. In the space of just nine days in 2016 in the US, Ally Brueger, Karina Vetrano and Vanessa Marcotte were all murdered by men while out running. There is no way for women to know whether single instances of abuse will escalate, so we have to anticipate worst-case scenarios, and regard every cat-calling man as a potential rapist or murderer. Street harassment is how men mark out public spaces as their own, making women into trespassers on male territory. Behavioural psychologists have observed how male pedestrians crowd women\u2019s personal space at cashpoints and traffic lights, how all-male groups take up more pavement space, and how men make more antisocial noises in public than women, considering it more acceptable to speak on mobile phones at checkouts or in train carriages. Women are more distressed than men by such unwanted public noise, and by having to challenge its perpetrators. We don\u2019t know how these encounters might escalate. This isn\u2019t a new problem. In fact, men have long sought to exclude women from public spaces and make them feel uncomfortable. In the 19th century, pubs, saloons and restaurants in the UK and US were almost exclusively male spaces. State ordinances forbade women from entering, or segregated them off into \u201cladies\u2019 snugs\u201d. In 1941, one male British pub-goer refused to use the word \u201cpub\u201d to refer to a mixed-sex establishment: \u201cpub\u201d was short for \u201cpublic house\u201d, and he reasoned that women therefore didn\u2019t belong in a \u201cpub\u201d, in the same way they didn\u2019t belong in \u201cpublic\u201d. In formally segregated spaces, women were generally only tolerated if they were there to serve men: as prostitutes or waitresses. Men applied a similar logic to all public spaces: if they treated all women on the street in the way they treated servants or prostitutes, it marked out those spaces as male domains, and suggested that women entering them consented to their own abuse. As the zoologist Edwin Ray Lankester, the third director of the Natural History Museum, wrote, if women \u201creally do wish to be left alone\u201d, they should \u201cavoid the haunts of men\u201d. The haunts of men were all public spaces, and it would therefore be \u201ccomic\u201d for a woman to \u201cobject being spoken to in the street\u201d.   Related: What would a city that is safe for women look like?    Many men today still appear to believe in a similar social contract. By abusing and harassing women, men make public spaces their own \u2013 and by entering those spaces, they perceive that women acquiesce to their abuse. Frequently the onus to prevent these behaviours falls on women rather than men. Many women will be familiar with advice such as holding your keys when you walk home, avoiding listening to music, not getting drunk, travelling on well-lit roads, or shouting \u201cfire\u201d rather than \u201crape\u201d in the case of assault, because the former is taken more seriously. Rather than taking boys and men aside and teaching them not to harass, assault or murder us, the responsibility for preventing male violence has been placed on women\u2019s conduct. We know that it\u2019s a minority of men who rape and murder women. But a great many engage in continual, low-level, unrecorded intimidation that hints towards assault and is threatening to women who they believe to have \u201cstrayed\u201d into their territory. It is difficult to overstate the damage this has done to women. Is it any wonder that we are much more likely to suffer anxiety and agoraphobia than men? Fear of male abuse has led women to give up once-loved activities, or stop walking or running alone. Women\u2019s experience of street harassment rockets during adolescence, when many teenage girls retreat to their bedrooms, as \u201cthe only place in the world [they] feel safe\u201d, as one told a researcher in 2001. Too often, women feel unsupported by authorities who are supposed to protect us. It\u2019s difficult to feel that much has changed since a US judge refused to prosecute street harassment in 1976, because it was \u201cgenerally accepted behaviour [that is] too frequent for a justice system to handle\u201d. What\u2019s missing from discussions about women\u2019s fears is a focus on men. Men\u2019s harassment and assault of women is part of a sustained, long-term attempt to roll back advances in women\u2019s rights and restrict our presence in public spaces. Some well-intentioned individual men ask how they can change their behaviours to make us feel calmer and safer, and are advised to cross the road to ensure they do not walk behind us at night. But we need solutions that rise above individual behaviour, and tackle men\u2019s abuse and intimidation of women as a systemic problem. This is an urgent frontier for women\u2019s rights.

In a case that has provoked outrage among politicians and sports chiefs, Volley Maniago Pordenone claimed Lara Lugli, 41, failed to tell them she was planning to have a baby when she signed a contract to play for the club during the 2018-19 volleyball season. Lugli, who was captain of the team, was fired in March 2019 after telling her employer about her pregnancy. She miscarried a month later and told the club she had lost the child. She also requested the \u20ac2,500 (\u00a32,140) salary owed for the month she played for the team before finding out she was pregnant. The club refused to pay and instead took legal action against Lugli, accusing her of not revealing her plans to have a child in an attempt to extract a higher salary. In a court document shared by Lugli on Facebook, the club accused her of \u201cdisproportionately selling her experience\u201d and \u201chiding her desire to be a mother\u201d. The club argued that her choice had led the team to perform badly for the rest of the season and, as a result, the squad had lost sponsorship money. \u201cWhen I read the legal document, I was so angry,\u201d Lugli told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing volleyball for 25 years and had given it everything \u2013 they knew this.

The top line of the real-world results, issued by the Israeli ministry of health and the companies but not yet peer-reviewed by scientists, is efficacy of 97% against disease and death and 94% against infection without symptoms.  Israel is the first country to have vaccinated more than half its population, which it has done with the collaboration of Pfizer/BioNTech and an agreement to monitor the results. As of Wednesday, about 55% of its 9 million population had been given at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, according to health ministry data, and 43% had received a second dose, which in Israel takes place three weeks after the first. Last month a paper from Israel\u2019s largest health provider, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, said the vaccine appeared to have 94% efficacy against symptomatic illness and 92% against severe disease. The companies declined to release the finer details of the results, on the grounds that they will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in due course. But Pfizer said the data confirmed the 95% efficacy it had found in its phase 3 trials of the vaccine, called BNT162b2, and pointed to the role the vaccine could play in stopping the virus spreading. \u201cThe findings which suggest that the vaccine may also provide protection against asymptomatic Sars-CoV-2 infections are particularly meaningful as we look to disrupt the spread of the virus around the globe,\u201d said Luis Jodar, the chief medical officer at Pfizer Vaccines.

Our vaccine has been effective in preventing Covid-19 cases, as well as profoundly reducing the rate of Covid-19-related severe diseases, hospitalisations and deaths.\u201d He said the findings were also important because the data was generated at a time when the Sars-CoV-2 variant B117 \u2013 known as the UK or Kent variant because of where it emerged \u2013 was the dominant strain. B117, which is highly transmissible, was responsible for 80% of tested cases in Israel during the study period. It now accounts for about 98% of cases in the UK and is also common around the world. However, the data shed no light on the effects of the vaccine against variants that have emerged in South Africa and Brazil, because there have been few cases of either in Israel. Prof Yeheskel Levy, the director of the Israeli health ministry, said the impact of vaccination had been profound. \u201cIncidence rates in the fully vaccinated population have massively dropped compared to the unvaccinated population, showing a marked decline in hospitalised cases due to Covid-19,\u201d he said. \u201cThis clearly demonstrates the power of the Covid-19 vaccine to fight this virus and encourages us to continue even more intensively with our vaccination campaign.

Republicans continue to advance a wave of restrictions in statehouses across the country while there is mounting pressure in Washington for Democrats to do away with the filibuster to pass significant federal voting rights legislation. This is an indication of how voting rights has only emerged as an escalating issue after the 2020 election. Here\u2019s a look at some of the key developments: Georgia The Georgia senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would make it significantly harder to vote by mail in the state after record turnout in 2020. The measure would do away with the no-excuse system Republicans implemented in the state and only allow people to cast a mail-in vote if they are aged 65 or older. The bill now heads over to the Georgia house of representatives, which last week passed its own sweeping restrictions to voting. New data shows how these policies would disproportionately harm Black voters. While the share of white voters who cast a mail-in ballot fell from 2016 to 2020, the share of Black voters increased from 23% to 31%, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice. Despite those changes, white voters still made up a larger portion of the voters aged 65+ who voted by mail in 2020. A different new study also shows that Black voters in Georgia are more likely than white voters to cast their ballot on the weekend days that could be cut. It\u2019s still unclear whether lawmakers will ultimately choose to get rid of no-excuse absentee voting in the final version of whatever bill they pass. Top Republicans in the state oppose requiring voters to give an excuse and several Republicans, including the lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, refused to participate in the senate vote. The filibuster Last week, my colleague Daniel Strauss and I spoke with Jim Clyburn, one of the most powerful Democrats in the US House of Representatives, about how Democrats should approach the filibuster. The procedure stands in the way of blocking HR1, a bill passed by the House last week, that would require states to offer early voting as well as same-day and automatic registration, among other significant measures. It also stands in the way of blocking a new version of the Voting Rights Act that would require states with a history of voting discrimination to get changes pre-cleared by the federal government. Clyburn stopped short of saying the filibuster should be eliminated entirely, but said Democrats needed to find a workaround for voting and other civil rights legislation. He also offered a warning for two moderate Democratic senators, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, some of the staunchest advocates of keeping the filibuster in place. \u201cThere\u2019s no way under the sun that in 2021 that we are going to allow the filibuster to be used to deny voting rights. That just ain\u2019t gonna happen. That would be catastrophic,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Manchin and Sinema enjoy being in the majority, they had better figure out a way to get around the filibuster when it comes to voting and civil rights.\u201d Biden\u2019s executive order Joe Biden issued an executive order on Sunday that makes some modest, but potentially consequential, expansions around voting rights. Two provisions in the executive order stood out to me. The first requires federal agencies to offer voter registration if a state requests that it do so. This measure \u2013 long pushed by civil rights groups \u2013 could make it significantly easier for vulnerable populations to register to vote. Requiring the federal Indian Health Service to offer voter registration, for example, could affect up to 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The second significant piece involves directing the attorney general to provide voter registration information to eligible people with felony convictions in federal custody. That\u2019s significant because people with felony convictions, and the officials who supervise them, often face a confusing maze of rules to figure out if they can vote again. In 2018, Crystal Mason, a Texas woman, was sentenced to five years in prison for voting while she was on supervised release (similar to probation) for a felony offense. The federal officials supervising Mason testified in court that they never told her she was ineligible to vote. The guidance required under Biden\u2019s order could help prevent that kind of confusion. Also worth watching \u2026  Iowa\u2019s governor signed a new law that cuts early voting, requires the polls to close an hour earlier, limits who can collect an absentee ballot and imposes criminal penalties for local election officials who don\u2019t follow state guidance.  Florida lawmakers advanced a bill that would prohibit local officials from setting up drop boxes for mail-in ballots, something that was widely popular in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m at a loss for words,\u201d one Republican local election official told Politico. A new study found that mail-in voting neither boosted turnout nor benefited Democrats. Republicans in Arizona continue to aggressively advance restrictions on mail-in voting. One measure that caught my eye yesterday was a bill that would require officials to reject a ballot that arrived by the close of the polls on election day if it was not also postmarked by the Thursday before the election.

Evanston, which sits on the shores of Lake Michigan north of downtown Chicago, is set for an initial disbursement of about $400,000 for housing needs, with a vote on the issue set to take place at the city council on 22 March. Under the proposal, residents would get $25,000 to use towards home improvements or mortgage assistance. To qualify, residents must have either been or descended from a Black person who lived in Evanston before 1969 who suffered from discriminatory housing practices by government and banks. This funding will be the first to flow in the wake of a landmark decision by Evanston in 2019 to financially compensate its Black residents for historical racism and discrimination. These reparations, set to total $10m, will come via community donations and a tax on marijuana. Robin Rue Simmons, a Black alderman who represents Evanston\u2019s historically black fifth ward, said reparations were the \u201cmost appropriate legislative response to the historic practices and the contemporary conditions of the Black community\u201d. Simmons said that \u201calthough many of the anti-Black policies have been outlawed, many remain embedded in policy, including zoning and other government practices. We are in a time in history where this nation more broadly has not only the will and awareness of why reparations is due, but the heart to advance it.\u201d However, a group has raised concerns over the proposal, claiming that it does not go far enough to be truly called reparations. The group, Evanston Rejects Racist Reparations, posted on Facebook that \u201chistorically racist financial institutions like banks, corporations and various individuals\u201d will profit from the move. The group wants the program to be called something other than reparations and for the city council to come back with direct payments to Black residents. Simmons has dismissed these criticisms, pointing out the council does not have authority over the banking industry. The National African American Reparations Commission, a non-profit civil rights organization, has cited the Evanston program as a model for reparations for the rest of the US. The US has a spotty records of discussing and distributing reparations in past decade, with most plans falling short or happening on a minor scale.

The trust\u2019s publication of the report, which considered how the lucrative proceeds of Britain\u2019s imperial past had helped build and furnish 93 trust properties, provoked furious headlines in the autumn, with some Tory MPs and media accusing the trust \u2013 one of the UK\u2019s biggest charities \u2013 of perpetuating \u201cMarxist\u201d or \u201cwoke\u201d views. A commission\u2019s statement published on Thursday said that while the concerns raised about the trust had the potential to damage the charity\u2019s reputation, it found the charity had acted appropriately in its commissioning of the report, and had \u201cprovided a well-reasoned justification\u201d for why the report furthered the charity\u2019s purposes. \u201cThe National Trust has been able to demonstrate that its work to examine links between its properties and histories of colonialism and slavery was carefully considered, and that it fitted within its charitable objects,\u201d said the commission chief executive, Helen Stephenson. \u201cI understand that this conclusion will not satisfy everyone. But I hope it is reassuring to those who raised concerns about the charity\u2019s report, who said it made them feel uncomfortable and concerned that the charity had lost its way, that the commission has examined the trust\u2019s actions very close.\u201d A National Trust spokesperson said: \u201cWe welcome the Charity Commission\u2019s conclusion that there are no grounds for regulatory action against us, following complaints the commission received about the report we published on historic slavery and colonialism links at the places we care for.\u201d Among the measures the trust had taken prior to publishing the report included consulting a panel of 2,000 trust members, among which it found \u201cconsiderable support for research into challenging histories provided the findings were appropriately researched and contextualised\u201d.

There have been countless newspaper articles, social media rows and two parliamentary debates on the issue since the autumn, amid reports of a supposed \u201crevolt\u201d among the trusts\u2019s 5.6 million members. There are wider concerns across the voluntary sector, with many charities fearing that the hounding of the National Trust reflects a wider hostility from some rightwing politicians designed to create a chilling effect on campaigners. It is understood some trust staff received death threats as a result of the furore. A freedom of information request published in November by Third Sector magazine revealed the commission had received just three complaints about the trust report. The trust said it had received 771 complaints \u2013 or 0.05% of its 5.6 million members \u2013 and many in support of the trust\u2019s decision to publish the report.

She wrote: \u201cIt is surely a sign of confidence, integrity and pride that while we can celebrate and enjoy history we can also explore and acknowledge all aspects of it. \u201cThe National Trust is at its best when we capture this complexity \u2013 when we present facts and material evidence in ways that inspire curiosity, inquiry, learning and sharing.\u201d Another household-name charity, Barnardos, remains subject to a Charity Commission compliance inquiry after Conservative MPs complained about the publication on its website of a blog examining the issues of \u201cwhite privilege\u201d in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement.", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Mississippi governor to sign bill banning trans athletes from women\u2019s teams", "full_article": "Tate Reeves, the Republican governor of Mississippi, is set to sign a bill on Thursday that will ban transgender athletes from competing on girls\u2019 or women\u2019s sports teams.

Mississippi\u2019s senate bill 2536 is set to become law on 1 July, although a legal challenge is possible. Reeves, who has three daughters who play sports, has said that the bill is needed to \u201cprotect young girls from being forced to compete with biological males for athletic opportunities\u201d. The governor added that the \u201cpush for kids to adopt transgenderism is just wrong\u201d.

The bill is likely to end up in federal court. More than 20 states are currently proposing restrictions on athletics or gender-confirming health care for transgender minors this year.

My best friend (to this day) and I used to pretend to be our own girl band during playtime at St Mary\u2019s Priory junior school, in Tottenham, north London. There\u2019s an area in the playground with some steps that we called \u201cthe stage\u201d. We thought we were the next big thing, singing Beyonc\u00e9 at the top of our voices. These days, when I\u2019m on playground duty, I sometimes see the children putting on similar performances there, just like we did. I tell them that I used to sing and dance on the \u201cstage\u201d, which they love. They get a kick, too, from knowing that some of the teachers still at St Mary\u2019s taught me when I was there.     \u2018My friends, singing and dancing, my lovely teachers: this was the epitome of happiness for my 9-year-old self\u2019 Photograph: PR    My friends, singing and dancing, my lovely teachers: this was the epitome of happiness for my 9-year-old self. I started at the school in year 4, and at first I was really sad as I missed my friends from my old school. But being a Tottenham born and raised girl, St Mary\u2019s soon started to feel like home, and I grew to love it. From a young age, I knew I wanted to be a teacher. I had such great teachers in my life, who always had me engaged and wanted to push me further. I even wrote into the local newspaper when I was 14, about how proud I was that St Mary\u2019s had received a good Ofsted rating. \u201cThe teachers are great, the food is fantastic, even the assemblies are interesting,\u201d I wrote, adding that one day I\u2019d love to be a teacher there. After that did indeed happen, I led a school assembly about careers and used myself as an example of what you can achieve when you set your mind to it! Tottenham has been the victim of bad press over the years, what with the riots of 2011 and it being a bit rough around the edges. But the local community is so warm and supportive. I\u2019m proud to be a product of Tottenham, and I\u2019ve learned that it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from, anything can be achieved if you work hard enough. My story hasn\u2019t been all plain sailing though. I lost my mum at the age of 15 and some of my GCSEs were impacted. As a result, my route to becoming a teacher was a bit of a journey. I took education studies at university, and then went on to get more experience in the field, working as a teaching assistant in various schools across London. Teachers that I worked with would often encourage me to take the leap and apply for a PGCE so I could become a fully-qualified teacher. With that encouragement, plus the support of my father and my friends, and thinking about what my mum would have wanted for me, I retook my GCSEs and went on to complete my PGCE at Middlesex University.     \u2018I think the senior leadership team at my school recognises the value of bringing in local teachers,\u2019 says Edwards-Hayde. Photograph: Amara Eno/Guardian    When it came time to find a job, I was encouraged to apply for positions at my two placement schools. But I really just wanted to work at St Mary\u2019s because it was such a happy place for me growing up. It was my ultimate goal, so I waited until a job became available. I started working here, in my old year 5 classroom, in September 2019 and haven\u2019t looked back. It\u2019s funny because I work alongside some of the teachers who taught me and my brothers. Getting the opportunity to work with the teaching assistant from when I was in year 6 makes me want to pinch myself. I was so inspired by these adults growing up, and now I\u2019m incredibly grateful to be working with and learning from these amazing, experienced teachers. There are actually six teachers that were previously students here too, including the incredible headteacher, so I\u2019m not alone! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that so many of us have returned. There is something about this school, and the Tottenham community, that gets under your skin. And I think the senior leadership team at my school recognises the value of bringing in local teachers, who really understand where these children come from. I\u2019m known for my infectious smile \u2013 and my laugh can be heard throughout the corridors. My enthusiasm branches out into my teaching. One day I might consider getting involved in senior leadership here, which would really mean I\u2019ve come full circle. But for now, I\u2019m just so happy to have achieved my childhood dream. I\u2019m thrilled to be where I am with my year 5s and to see them smiling and enjoying learning. In time, I hope they will cherish the memories they\u2019re making here, just like I do.

Figures from NHS England show 4.59 million people were waiting to start treatment at the end of January \u2013 the highest number since records began in August 2007, reflecting the severe pressures faced by the health service due to the second Covid peak. The number waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment stood at 304,044 in the same month \u2013 the highest number for any calendar month since January 2008.  Patients are now waiting 12.1 weeks on average, up from 8.4 weeks in January 2020. This remains well below the 19.6-week median wait recorded in July 2020.   The number of people waiting for treatment in England reached a record high in January for the second month running.   Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, said: \u201cAdmitting more than 100,000 Covid patients to hospital in a single month inevitably had a knock-on effect on some non-urgent care. \u201cHowever, thanks to the hard work of NHS staff and the innovations in treatment and care developed over the course of the pandemic, hospitals treated more than 1 million people with other conditions in January, at the peak of the winter wave, nearly twice as many as they did last April. \u201cThat is a testament to the skill, dedication and commitment nurses, doctors, therapists and countless other staff showed in the most challenging period in NHS history.\u201d A separate release also showed a fall in the number of people presenting for cancer checks and treatments, which were down across every single category this past January compared with the same month in 2020. The figures include an 11% drop in the number of people being seen by a specialist for suspected cancer following an urgent referral by their GP, compared with January 2020. The NHS aims to see 93% of these patients within two weeks; however, just 83.4% were seen within a fortnight in January, a record low.   Related: NHS England poll shows rising toll of work stress on staff health    The number of people in England starting cancer treatment is also down 16% compared with the same month last year.

Macmillan\u2019s head of policy, Sara Bainbridge, said the newly released figures \u201ccast a long shadow over people living with cancer\u201d, adding that tens of thousands of people have missed out on a diagnosis due to disruption caused by the pandemic. Elsewhere, the NHS figures showed that A&amp;E attendances were the third lowest on record in terms of all A&amp;Es and the second worst in terms of type 1 (general) A&amp;Es although the proportion seen within four hours in both settings was up compared to January. The overall number of people attending a yype 1 A&amp;E in February was down 27% compared with the same month last year and down 35% across all A&amp;E attendances.

Below, in the dark, was Edvard Munch\u2019s painting The Scream, stolen three months earlier from the national gallery in Oslo. With Hill was an art dealer, who had brought him to this secret location, and two men, hoodwinked by Hill\u2019s pseudonym of Chris Roberts, who were handling the sale of the missing masterpiece. \u201cI posed as a representative of the Getty Museum, wanting to buy the painting. The Getty was wonderful in creating an identity for me. There was a lot of tough talk and near misses, but the thieves fell for it.\u201d Hill, who has died aged 73 after surgery to repair a torn aorta, refused point blank to go down the hatch. He had worked with the Metropolitan police\u2019s art and antiques unit for six years, and knew that, while often romanticised, art thieves could be a dangerous bunch, wrapped up in organised crime. When hunting art, there was a serious risk, Hill told the BBC documentary The Billion Dollar Art Hunt (2020), that one could be \u201cmaimed or murdered\u201d.  When the painting was brought up, the first thing the police officer did was to search its surface for the candle wax spilt by Munch when he painted the work in 1893. \u201cIn that particular version, the original version, he blew a candle out on it. I made a particular point of memorising exactly how those candle-wax drops looked.\u201d The thieves in the Scream case, Hill said, were \u201clocal no-hopers\u201d, who had merely climbed in through a window of the museum, yet high-level art theft is mostly the preserve of international gangs mixed up with the drugs and arms trade.     Hill recovered one version of Munch\u2019s The Scream from a basement in a Norwegian fjord town. Photograph: AP    By the time he had travelled to Norway, his skills sought by the Norwegian government, Hill was well respected for his personable approach and a network of contacts that straddled the art world and the underworld. He had made his name in 1993, tracking down Lady Writing a Letter With Her Maid by Johannes Vermeer, stolen from Russborough House, an Irish stately home, seven years earlier. Shortly after the raid, the gangster Martin Cahill had demanded a multimillion-pound ransom for its return. Putting on an accent, and working on a tip-off, Hill posed as an art dealer who had Middle Eastern buyers lined up. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep your lies to a minimum, but you\u2019ve got to present yourself as somebody people want you to be,\u201d Hill explained in 2018. \u201cI\u2019m as straight as I can be with people, but with a reasonable amount of charm.\u201d The masquerade led him to a multi-storey car park in Antwerp. In the boot of a rented car, wrapped in rubbish sacks, was the Dutch baroque masterpiece. \u201cI had to mask my emotions as I unwrapped the painting,\u201d Hill said. \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest masterpiece I\u2019ve had the pleasure to hold.\u201d Alongside it, unexpectedly, was Goya\u2019s Portrait of Do\u00f1a Antonia Z\u00e1rate. Hill was born in Cambridge, the son of Zita (nee Tinling Widdrington), a ballerina, and Landon Hill, a captain in the US air force working on missile projects. The family moved between Britain, Germany and the US before settling in Washington DC. There, Charley attended the private St Albans school. He enlisted in the 1968 war draft, serving in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. On his return to civilian life, he enrolled at George Washington University in 1971 to study history, working nights as a museum security guard, before moving on a Fulbright scholarship to Trinity College Dublin. He taught at a Belfast school and was a youth worker until 1974, and then attended King\u2019s College London, studying theology for two years on a veterans\u2019 grant. He briefly considered ordination in the Church of England, but instead joined the Metropolitan police, first on the beat in Stamford Hill, then as a detective within the serious and organised crime squad. When he was made detective chief inspector in 1990, the art and antiques unit became one of his responsibilities.  In 1992, Hill recovered Christ and the Woman Taken in Adultery, a masterpiece of the Flemish school by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, valued at more than $1m, stolen from the Courtauld Gallery 10 years earlier. He also worked alongside the German police and Czech authorities to recover a $200,000 Lucas Cranach oil painting taken in a 1991 heist from the National Gallery in Prague.    I never give up. Those cases just remain open, until they\u2019re solved       On leaving the force in 1997, he joined Nordstern Art Insurance (now Axa XL) in the City of London as a risk manager. In 2002 he returned to detective work, but in a private capacity. In his first year as a private eye, it became known that Hill was working with David Duddin, an art thief on parole, in his search for Titian\u2019s Rest on the Flight into Egypt, stolen from the Marquess of Bath in 1995, and Jean-Baptiste Oudry\u2019s The White Duck, taken in 1992 from the Marquess of Cholmondeley\u2019s home in Norfolk, Houghton Hall. His acceptance that he might have to collaborate with crooks to recover art, often using rewards as bait, attracted criticism, but Hill claimed he was always \u201cmore interested in recovering the art than capturing the criminals\u201d. At the time of his death, Hill was following a lead in the case of $500m worth of art stolen in 1990 from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. The FBI have long believed the 13 paintings, including works by Rembrandt, Degas and Manet, remain in the US, but Hill was convinced the haul lay sealed behind a wall in a house in west Dublin. His investigation was the subject of the erroneously titled The Billion Dollar Art Hunt, though Hill fell out with the producers, accusing them of putting the life of his source, the career criminal Martin Foley, at risk. \u201cI never give up,\u201d Hill said when asked if he had ever failed in his investigations. \u201cThose cases just remain open, until they\u2019re solved.\u201d The Boston paintings are still at large. Hill is survived by his wife, Caroline (nee Stewart), whom he married in 1979, and their children, Susannah, Lizzie and Chris, and grandchildren, Georgia and Olivia.  \u2022 Charles Patrick Landon Hill, detective, born 22 May 1947; died 20 February 2021", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "'It\u2019s every man for himself': the Texans defying end of mask mandate ", "full_article": "The parking lot was packed at The Shops at La Cantera, a partially outdoor mall in north-west San Antonio, on the day that Texas officially ended mandatory mask wearing.

The thing that struck me was when she was describing the press conference after the shooting happened. She said it was a room full of journalists, a place full of chaos. But when the police began reading out of the names of the children who died [16 children and a teacher lost their lives in the massacre] the room became silent. She said the sound of that silence stuck with her. Shortly after that conversation, I was sitting in the living room with my fiancee, Molly, and she had a glass of wine; she was playing with the wine glass on this wee flimsy table we had and the sounds were making it shake. It sounded like a tremble, a shiver, in the silence. I thought the soundtrack should be based around that. Writing the music was a new experience because, with Glasvegas, you can self destruct if you want \u2013 it\u2019s up to you, because it\u2019s your thing. But when you\u2019re part of a much bigger thing you can\u2019t do that. Your job is to move someone else\u2019s story along. I\u2019ve been obsessed with soundtracks since I was a kid \u2013 I was always more interested in them than the movies: Bill Conti\u2019s Karate Kid soundtrack; Jack Nitzsche\u2019s music for Stand By Me; and then the one that really blew my mind was Philadelphia by Howard Shore. People think you can take the music this way or that way, but I think they underestimate how often the music leads you. I\u2019ve tried before to influence things but the music will say \u201cno, this is the way we\u2019re going\u201d and that\u2019s how it was with this. Once I have the start of a melody, I can\u2019t stop thinking about it until it\u2019s resolved. Sometimes, the melodies never resolve, but the best ones always do. Until they do, it\u2019s like you\u2019re going mad \u2013 I think about them when I\u2019m trying to sleep or talking to somebody. But that\u2019s just artists I guess. We\u2019re a wee bit mad. With Glasvegas, people are just waiting until I\u2019m happy, then they say \u201cquick, record it before he changes his mind!\u201d But with this I needed someone else\u2019s approval, which was a new experience. The feedback for my first composition was: \u201cCan you make it more dramatic?\u201d I didn\u2019t really know what that meant, so I took it as licence to really push things. I sent back another version on the night of the deadline and was told \u201cThis is too dramatic\u201d. But we got there, eventually. I\u2019d definitely like to pursue doing more soundtrack work. Other people are better at describing how they feel, but perhaps that\u2019s why they don\u2019t need to make music. Now that I think about it, maybe this is how I express my emotions best.

Speaking in the capital of Naypyidaw on Thursday, a junta spokesman, Zaw Min Tun, alleged the detained chief minister of Yangon admitted giving Aung San Suu Kyi $600,000 in cash, along with more than 11kg ($680,000 worth) of gold. The anti-corruption commission was investigating, Zaw Min Tun said. The claims were strongly rejected by members of her National League for Democracy, one of whom, former MP Aye Ma Ma Myo, told Reuters: \u201cIt is no longer uncommon to see slander against politicians and efforts to crush the party while innocent young people are killed in public.\u201d Aung San Suu Kyi, detained since the coup, faces other criminal charges including owning unlicensed walkie-talkies and violating coronavirus restrictions by staging a campaign event in 2020.   Related: Myanmar police surround protesters and raid compound in Yangon    The new charges came as the military\u2019s crackdown on protests opposing the coup continued. Local media, witnesses and medics said six people were shot dead in the central town of Myaing on Thursday when security forces opened fire on anti-junta protests and domestic media said one man was killed in the North Dagon district of Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s biggest city. Photographs posted on Facebook showed a man lying prone on the street, bleeding from a head wound. A further death was reported in Mandalay. More than 60 people are believed to have been killed protesting against the 1 February coup that removed Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government from power. The UN statement criticising the crackdown however removed language that explicitly condemned the coup and threatened possible further action from the British-drafted text, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam. The presidential statement, signed by all 15 members of the security council called for \u201cutmost restraint\u201d by the military. A presidential statement is a step below a resolution but becomes part of the official record of the UN\u2019s most powerful body. The statement called for the immediate release of government leaders including state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi and president Win Myint who have been detained since they were ousted in the coup. It said it supported the country\u2019s democratic transition and \u201cstresses the need to uphold democratic institutions and processes, refrain from violence, fully respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and uphold the rule of law\u201d. But it is weaker than the initial draft circulated by the United Kingdom which would have condemned the military coup itself and threatened \u201cpossible measures under the UN Charter\u201d \u2013 UN language for sanctions \u2013 \u201cshould the situation deteriorate further.\u201d Diplomats said council members China, Russia, India and Vietnam, which is a member of the 10-nations Association of Southeast Asian Nations known as Asean, along with Myanmar, objected to provisions in stronger earlier drafts of the statement. China\u2019s UN Ambassador Zhang Jun said in a statement that \u201cit is important the council members speak in one voice,\u201d and declared that it\u2019s now time for de-escalation, diplomacy and dialogue. The UN statement came as Amnesty International accused Myanmar security forces of using battlefield weapons on unarmed protesters and carrying out premeditated killings orchestrated by their commanding officers. International pressure on the Myanmar junta has mounted since the army ousted and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month, triggering daily protests around the country. The United States also applied fresh pressure with sanctions against Aung Pyae Sone and Khin Thiri Thet Mon, two adult children of Myanmar junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. The pair have a variety of business holdings that have directly benefited from their \u201cfather\u2019s position and malign influence\u201d, said a US Treasury statement. The UK is also exploring fresh sanctions, foreign minister Dominic Raab said in a tweet.    Welcome news from @SecBlinken of further sanctions targeting the Myanmar Commander-in-Chief\u2019s family and business interests. The UK is exploring additional sanctions too \u2013 we are clear the regime should not be allowed to profit from abuse of power and human rights violations.&mdash; Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) March 10, 2021    Close to 2,000 people have been arrested and the death toll has climbed to more than 60 in a post-coup crackdown. On Wednesday, police surrounded and arrested at least 200 students and civilians protesting against the military coup on the outskirts of Yangon, according to witnesses who said those detained were driven away in unmarked trucks. Video footage from North Okkalapa showed protesters fleeing under fire. At least one person appeared to be seriously wounded. \u201cSome of them were severely beaten, but the people are still continuing their protest,\u201d a local rescue worker told AFP. Footage showed people coughing and washing their faces after teargas was deployed and there were reports of gunfire. \u201cA girl was wounded in her pelvic area by gunshot and she was taken to her home because the hospital is occupied by the security forces,\u201d a rescue worker said. Earlier, military forces raided a compound in a Yangon neighbourhood that is home to state railway workers who have been on strike.

The movement has resulted in hospital disruptions, bank closures and empty ministry offices. Amnesty International meanwhile, has collated graphic video clips posted on social media to document what it called a \u201cnationwide killing spree\u201d in the weeks since the military seized power on 1 February. \u201cThese Myanmar military tactics are far from new, but their killing sprees have never before been livestreamed for the world to see,\u201d Joanne Mariner, Amnesty\u2019s director of crisis response, said in a new report. \u201cThese are not the actions of overwhelmed, individual officers making poor decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are unrepentant commanders already implicated in crimes against humanity, deploying their troops and murderous methods in the open.\u201d Amnesty analysed 55 videos recorded from 28 February to 8 March in cities across Myanmar, including Mandalay and Yangon. In one Facebook clip, dated 28 February from the south-eastern city of Dawei, a soldier was seen handing his rifle to a police officer next to him. The policeman takes aim and shoots, before personnel around them erupt in apparent celebration. The footage was recorded from a property above the street. In the background of the audio, women can be heard sobbing. \u201cNot only does this incident show a reckless disregard for human life, making sport of shooting live rounds at protesters, it also reveals deliberate coordination among security forces,\u201d Mariner said.

The decision by Natural England to recognise the national importance of Swanscombe peninsula, which is home to 1,991 species of invertebrates, more than any known site in the country, was welcomed by campaigners hoping to save the partly brownfield site from the \u00a33.5bn London Resort. Giving SSSI status to the wetlands and former concrete works, one of only two locations where the distinguished jumping spider is found, would normally protect the area from development. But the government has deemed the proposed theme park to be a \u201cnationally significant infrastructure project\u201d \u2013 a classification normally reserved for major roads or airports \u2013 which means environmental factors can be overridden during the planning process. Matt Shardlow, the chief executive of Buglife, thanked Natural England \u201cfor doing the right thing by protecting one of the country\u2019s most important wildlife sites\u201d but added: \u201cThe Swanscombe peninsula remains under threat and it is crucial that a precedent isn\u2019t set by allowing a fun fair to be considered as more important than the wildlife that inspires wonder and sustains us.\u201d Buglife, the RSPB and Kent Wildlife Trust called on Natural England \u201cto do everything in its power\u201d to ensure that the newly proposed SSSI is protected and the government is made fully aware of the \u201cexceptional value\u201d of Swanscombe peninsula and the wider ecology of the Thames estuary. James Seymour, the Sussex and Kent area manager for Natural England, said: \u201cThe designation of Swanscombe peninsula as an SSSI is great news for one of the richest known sites in England for invertebrates, ensuring essential refuge for many rare and threatened species that sadly are not able to thrive in the wider landscape. \u201cRight on the doorstep of some of our most densely populated towns and cities, this new SSSI will also offer wonderful opportunities for people to connect with nature via the England coast path. This area is living proof that some of our most important species can thrive hand in hand with businesses and transport infrastructure. Special places like this will form the vital backbone of a national nature recovery network.\u201d Natural England said it was aware of the \u201cpotential development opportunities\u201d around Swanscombe and the SSSI designation for 250 hectares of the peninsula was an important step in ensuring its environmental value was \u201ctaken due account of\u201d in any future planning decisions. PY Gerbeau, chief executive of London Resort Company Holdings, said: \u201cThe project will of course continue, and this is just another issue to address in the long history of this project.\u201d He added: \u201cSustainability is a green thread throughout the London Resort proposals and we\u2019re very proud of that. We have demonstrated, across thousands of pages within our application, our vision to deliver a net gain in biodiversity and our commitment to enhancing and managing habitats. An investment that runs into millions because we believe in sustainability and in our role as custodians of the environment. \u201cWe have shown how we plan to transform a contaminated, former industrial site, through this exceptional, once in a lifetime opportunity.

They are discovered hanging from a mango tree. Sexual activity may or may not have taken place, prior to their deaths. Were they killed or did they kill themselves? There are eyewitnesses who may be the aggressors \u2013 their stories don\u2019t match up. To add to this, there is a defining visual image. The dead bodies hang from the tree for days, knocking against each other in repetitive, heart-breaking camaraderie, while the grieving women of the village form a circle around the tree trunk, to prevent the girls from being taken down. If they come down, Padma and Lalli (not their real names) will be forgotten. As long as the corpses retain the power to horrify, they are protected from indifference. \u201cPlace is the crossroads of circumstance,\u201d Eudora Welty wrote in her 1957 essay \u201cPlace in Fiction\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe proving ground of, what happened? Who\u2019s here?

But this was not the case.\u201d What follows, in this shocking, mesmerising book by Sonia Faleiro, is an unravelling of shared hubris.   Related: India\u2019s caste system is alive and kicking \u2013 and maiming and killing | Mari Marcel Thekaekara    Faleiro uses the structures of a true crime narrative. The need in the reader to understand these painfully premature deaths and make sense of the world, means that the real objective of The Good Girls \u2013 to turn and face the factual horror of inequality \u2013 is skilfully masked. \u201cJournalists justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments,\u201d was the verdict of Janet Malcolm in The Journalist and the Murderer (1989); \u201cThe more pompous talk about freedom of speech and \u2018the public\u2019s right to know\u2019; the least talented talk about Art.\u201d In this sense, Faleiro is a judicious writer: as with her nonfiction debut Beautiful Thing \u2013 a portrait of the table dancers of Bombay \u2013 the prose in The Good Girls is full of precise intention. Facts are presented without the electric burn of outrage. The reader plays detective as the story unfolds, piecing together \u201cevidence\u201d that is remembered from earlier chapters \u2013 a phone call, a text, a snatch of overheard conversation, an admission that might later be denied. The author will not hold your hand as you navigate this mystery; instead you are encouraged to solve it yourself. At the heart of the book, and crucial to interpretation of events, is the question of consent \u2013 more specifically, of consensual desire. Padma and Lalli are referred to repeatedly by relatives and politicians as family assets \u2013 tangible, walking, breathing manifestations of family honour. There are multiple discussions as to whether they have been raped \u2013 at one point the media reports declare this to be incontrovertible, and yet the evidence does not support it beyond reasonable doubt. Vital evidence is tampered with, in the name of saving family honour: phone recordings are deleted, witnesses are told to revise their stories, and the number of potential rapists swells from one to five and back again. The idea that the girls might have had their own romantic lives with boys from the village is crushed in the white noise of gossip and misinformation. Faleiro\u2019s subjects are numerous and interconnected \u2013 from India\u2019s corrupt politicians and media to the deleterious effects of caste prejudice and the systemic rot scouring its way through the police force. But her core subject is that of entrapment, and she returns again and again to the lack of agency that the girls have over their own lives, banned as they are from wandering freely around the village and its environs. The author concludes that \u201can Indian woman\u2019s first challenge was surviving her own home\u201d. The girls\u2019 nightly journey to squat in the fields after dinner to relieve themselves emerges as the only gap in a system set up to put them under constant surveillance. And it is this gap of possibility, at Welty\u2019s \u201ccrossroads of circumstance\u201d that Padma and Lalli enter flushed with life, only to die hours later.

Sorry, Lonely and Head &amp; Heart (the latter a six-week chart topper) have collectively earned more than a billion streams and made Corry into one of the UK\u2019s biggest new pop stars, a Calvin Harris type who has guest vocalists out front while he prods equipment and points gunfingers skyward. Sorry got a boost from being used on Love Island in 2018, and his music is rather like the Love Island of pop: buoyant, cheesy, suffused with romantic drama and sparkling sunlight. But when talking to him in his hotel room, clouds gather. Corry could actually be a Love Island contestant: he has the good looks and earnest kindly nature of a 90s boyband heartthrob, as well as the abdominals, which look not so much chiselled as 3D-printed following a successful earlier career as a bodybuilder. In fact, he has reality TV pedigree as a rare southern interloper amid the cast of MTV\u2019s lairy Geordie Shore; he was the boyfriend of the show\u2019s charismatic bad-influencer Sophie Kasaei, with whom he had a six-year relationship until 2017.              His TV-ready teeth beam out of his webcam in Dubai, where he spent the early weeks of the year following a presumably lucrative New Year\u2019s Eve DJ set, at \u2013 he stresses \u2013 a socially distanced, masked and seated venue in the city. Kasaei and her peers were criticised for travelling to Dubai mid-pandemic to pose in swimwear on their socials, but Corry says he has kept his head down: \u201cLooking like you\u2019re living it up \u2026 while everyone back at home is just having such a horrible time of it \u2013 that doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d He has since returned to the UK, and while his reasoning for going out in the first place hardly seems essential business \u2013 he wanted to, after the pandemic cancelled a year of DJing \u2013 he says that aside from some rooftop exercise classes he filmed, he stayed put in his hotel room, recorded his weekly Kiss FM show and tinkered with new tracks. This workaholism has been with him his whole life, says Corry: \u201cIt\u2019s a gift and a curse. I\u2019m pretty isolated. I know it looks like I\u2019ve got a lot going on, but the truth is, I have one really good friend, my mum, my sister and my brother. And there\u2019s no one else in that circle.\u201d Inspired by his DJ older brother, he started out as a teenage UK garage fan in Barnet, north London, originally calling himself DJ Jenga. He cringes, his face creasing at the memory: \u201cMy brother had this line about me: all the DJs are falling down but Jenga\u2019s still rising! I thought I was so cool. Garage, and grime: it\u2019s my roots. I grew up in a period where I felt I was part of something.\u201d He and a friend started a DJ business, playing discos and birthday parties in north London, and Corry graduated to residencies at the capital\u2019s clubs. \u201cIt was a hustle, turning up and asking the DJ if you could do their warmup set,\u201d he says. He studied music production at college, then the music business at university; while his fellow freshers were out strawpedoing alcopops, he was providing the soundtrack. \u201cI\u2019ve DJed to commercial dancefloors \u2013 sometimes six or seven nights a week \u2013 since I was 16, and I\u2019m 32 now. DJing is the love of my life; it\u2019s electricity, adrenaline, joy. And when it comes to production and creating my music, I now know the moments the crowd need to have: the drops, the singalong moments, the hooks.\u201d     Sophie Kasaei and Joel Corry in 2013. Photograph: WENN Rights Ltd/Alamy    A side hustle was working as a runner at MTV while DJing at the weekends in Mayfair, where he could get the Geordie Shore cast on to guestlists. Soon he was dating Kasaei and became a TV star in his own right. \u201cTwitter and Instagram had just exploded; it was brutal at points,\u201d he says. \u201cI was able to get a bit of a thick skin to the bad comments and nasty stuff, but it was difficult to see [Kasaei] going through that. It made us closer as well; we were a team, getting through.\u201d He says he has generally good memories of the show, though, and his raised profile took his DJing nationwide and to European party resorts such as Malia and Zante each summer. I can almost hear him shouting out the drinks promos on the mic between tracks. \u201cMaybe they weren\u2019t the most credible gigs,\u201d he admits. \u201cI was playing a lot of crap venues. I\u2019ve played in every town in the UK, and I played to so many empty clubs. But my name was still on the flyer, you know? I just felt like, whatever I do, get my name out there. The TV thing was another platform for me to push myself.\u201d    I had to be on my own. And I still feel like that now. It\u2019s almost selfish, but I can\u2019t have any distractions, man  Joel Corry     So too was the bodybuilding: he won competitions, earned sponsorship deals and got the bodybuilding equivalent of a No 1 single: the cover of Muscle &amp; Fitness magazine, his torso straining like a mixed grill through a fishing net. He first hit the gym back in his school days, idolising Arnie and Sly and in search of a six pack to impress girls, \u201cthen the competitive side of me wanted to see how far I could push it\u201d. Getting the ultra-lean physique to be best in show in his bodybuilding career was also difficult, and required some damaging behaviour. \u201cDefinitely at points it was unbalanced. There were no darker nights than the ones when I was in bed starving, wanting to have food but I didn\u2019t because I was on the diet plan.     \u2018Exercise was a way of channelling whatever was going on in my head\u2019 ... Joel Corry. Photograph: Benjamin Hennig/PR    \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say doing those competitions is healthy,\u201d he continues. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t recommend them. That\u2019s got to come from a burning desire in the individual, wanting to push themselves to another level.\u201d His physique has settled from hypertrophied to merely very jacked. \u201cEvery morning when I go on the treadmill or do weights, everything in my brain is firing for my to-do list that day; that\u2019s what I get out of it now.\u201d Buffeted by body image expectations on one side and his own drive on the other, Corry seems to have walked a tightrope towards a healthier state of fitness, to the point where he is now satirising the quests for bodily perfection and social media clout in his Black Mirror-ish music videos. But he still seems prone to the same obsessive behaviour that once spurred him to compete. As a teenager, \u201cI felt like I had to make myself look like that to, kind of like ...\u201d He grasps: \u201cBe me. Exercise, even to an obsessional level, was a way of channelling whatever was going on in my head, controlling anxieties. As I\u2019ve got older, I\u2019m able to channel the obsessive stuff into my music career.\u201d He says this brutal single-mindedness pushed him to break up with Kasaei. \u201cMy ambitions of what I wanted to do, and things I wanted to achieve, I had to be on my own. And I still feel like that\u2019s the way now. It\u2019s almost selfish, but I can\u2019t have any distractions, man. My mum is like: \u2018Joel, one day you need to get married!\u2019 But right now, I can\u2019t see it. I focused 100% of my time and my love into making it in the music industry, and it eventually happened.\u201d Beginning in 2015, he released 12 singles in a row that didn\u2019t reach the Top 100, but after putting his focus entirely on music, he forged industry connections and partnerships to the point he is now constantly courted by songwriters keen for him to add his production. He says he prefers working in person with them in his studio space in King\u2019s Cross, London, creating tracks \u201corganically made from the ground up, from having a loop on or some chords. Early demos of some of these tracks are someone just humming.\u201d              His subsequent back-to-back hits are now joined by new single Bed, a collaboration with the pop singer Raye and dance titan David Guetta that is currently rising through the charts. Where Head &amp; Heart was addictively catchy, vocalist MNEK evoking a fluttering heart in the phonetic chorus, Bed is no less of an earworm, but softer, with gorgeous cosmic-disco detailing and what is becoming Corry\u2019s signature flourish: a climactic drop that lands with devastating sweetness on the offbeat. He will next try to add a hit album to his singles; if he achieves that, will he finally be happy? \u201cI\u2019m never satisfied,\u201d he says, his voice a blend of athletic will and wry, exasperated guilt. \u201cIt\u2019s not a money thing; it\u2019s more a validation thing.

Shell also announced on Thursday that its chairman, Chad Holliday, would step down after six years in the role, to be succeeded by the former BHP chief executive Andrew Mackenzie from May. Mackenzie\u2019s six-year tenure at BHP Billiton was defined by an ambitious turnaround programme in which the Anglo-Australian company streamlined its operations and shrugged off its interests in US shale drilling.

India\u2019s record at home is incredible and they came into the series full of confidence after winning in Australia; England had an inexperienced batting lineup, particularly against spin, and badly needed a top-level, ready-to-go second spinner. The series threw up plenty of issues for them, areas they have to work on if they want to move towards being the best in the world, but I don\u2019t think the result was surprising. When you put it in perspective, it was probably about par.   Related: England's treatment of Jonny Bairstow has continued his cycle of pain and joy | Jonathan Liew    Ravichandran Ashwin, India\u2019s wonderful 34-year-old spinner, was the man of the series but the players who stood out for me were their youngsters, which is a theme that continued from Australia. Washington Sundar, only 21, had played one Test before but averaged 90.50 in his three appearances and took a couple of wickets; the 23-year-old Rishabh Pant kept wicket well and batted excellently; Axar Patel, 27, played the first three Tests of his career and took 27 wickets at an average of 10.59. These are players who have been brought up in the IPL, which is a different type of cricket but means they are bred to handle pressure, so these moments don\u2019t faze them. This is the culture of Indian cricket and I think it could help them dominate the sport for a while. They have a very balanced side: in the past they didn\u2019t always have the seam bowlers, but now they\u2019ve got Jasprit Bumrah, and when he couldn\u2019t play Mohammed Siraj came in and was outstanding. Then there\u2019s Virat Kohli: they won the series in Australia despite having their captain for only one game and against England he batted poorly, averaging 28.66, but once again they showed they don\u2019t rely on him. This is a great India squad full of options, high on confidence, and they were playing in ideal conditions. Losing to them in India is no disgrace, and no surprise.     Virat Kohli, Axar Patel, Rishabh Pant and Mohammed Siraj (left to right) hold the series trophy. Photograph: Amit Dave/Reuters    There was lots of controversy about the state of the pitches. I don\u2019t think many people, even in India, would disagree that the third Test, which finished in two days, was played on a poor wicket \u2013 India made full use of home advantage with that one and took it to an extreme. Overall, though, I don\u2019t think the pitches were a factor in winning or losing the series, particularly given England won three of the four tosses. Only once did England take advantage of that good fortune, when a double century from Joe Root and good innings from Dom Sibley and Ben Stokes put them in control of the opening Test. On a flat wicket they were OK but as soon as it started to spin the lack of options was obvious. Players were repeatedly getting out bowled or lbw to balls that went straight, they weren\u2019t getting their bat out in front, and they were getting stuck in the danger zone rather than getting really forward or getting really back. Under extreme pressure an inexperienced lineup repeatedly crumbled.    Sometimes we do focus on specific tours rather than the bigger picture    The top order struggled horribly. In eight innings England\u2019s opening partnership posted more than 10 runs only twice and only once did they get as many as 20. Other than the first innings of the series, the opening partnership lasted, on average, 18.6 deliveries, while across the entire series the second wicket lasted 25.4. This meant Root, batting at No 4, was coming in far too early: without a platform, he had an unbearable amount of pressure as he tried to make up for the deficiencies around him. Over the last 18 months or so England have been able to get early runs, but in spinning conditions that did not happen. As a result there is once again doubt about the best lineup, and players who feel they are on the verge of getting dropped will struggle to show their best. England always have a packed diary, but when push comes to shove there are only two tours \u2013 India and Australia \u2013 where careers get made. If you can perform there, in the toughest conditions for different reasons, on wickets ideal either for spin or for bounce and seam, you\u2019ve made your name. But sometimes we do focus on specific tours rather than the bigger picture, on results in extreme conditions that we have to face only infrequently.   Related: Sam Curran's convoluted diary shows England have lost control of players | Ali Martin    It will be interesting now to see how England bounce back in the summer, when there are two Tests against New Zealand and then five against India at home, probably with a few green-topped seaming pitches literally to swing things in their favour a little. If they can park this series just gone, realise they won\u2019t have to face this kind of challenge again for a while, get their batters firing again, help Jack Leach, their frontline spinner and the one English player who improved through the series, as he continues to develop, and refocus on the Test journey ahead, there is still a bright future there for the taking.     Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.   Now is the time to plan for the next cycle \u2013 start, for example, by looking after the seam bowlers, particularly Jofra Archer with his troublesome elbow and the overworked Ben Stokes, because come the Ashes next winter they are going to be vital and their workloads between now and then will have to be very carefully managed. The India series ended with a run of emphatic defeats and individual disappointments but playing these opponents in these conditions is probably the hardest of all cricketing arts to master.

He acquires an opioid addiction that blossoms into a full-scale smack habit, miserably shared with his young wife Emily (Ciara Bravo), and finally finds a new trade in robbing banks, like a zombie wired on desperation. The Russos produce and direct, and screenwriters Angela Russo-Otstot and Jessica Goldberg have adapted the bestselling autobiographical novel by the decorated war veteran and ex-convict Nico Walker about his own desolate experiences in Civvy Street, robbing banks to feed his habit.   Related: Marvel directors the Russo brothers: 'The Avengers films were a powerful political tool, at the right time'     Holland is a fierce, compact presence, his jaw muscles perennially working: he is a sweetly innocent young guy who falls for fellow college student Emily and one afternoon makes a fatally premature decision to tell her he loves her. Instead of hearing \u201cI love you\u201d back, Emily is scared by the gesture, pulls away from him and in angry despair at what turns out to be a temporary break-up Cherry irreversibly signs on the dotted line to join the army. Everything follows from that.              The movie is divided into self-consciously weighty and epic chapters, but really it splits into two parts, war and postwar: Cherry\u2019s military career in Iraq, in which he is both brutalised and brutalising, and then the grim nightmare of his civilian life which makes it clear that the \u201cpost\u201d in post-traumatic stress disorder is wrong. His is a life of continuing trauma, continuing stress and continuing disorder. This is a vehement, heartfelt film that culminates in a colossally grandiose sequence with a full-scale overhead camera shot (the sort mocked in Team America: World Police) and Puccini blaring on the soundtrack. Holland certainly brings his A-game. At various times, he reminded me of Jake Gyllenhaal as the stoic grunt in Sam Mendes\u2019s Jarhead and the smack addict Heath Ledger in Neil Armfield\u2019s underrated heroin drama Candy. But Emily\u2019s story is skated over and the film is rounded off a little too easily into a straightforward redemption story (its mood tacitly absorbing the happy ending of the publishing and movie deals) with no permanent price paid. There is the bleakest kind of chaotic humour in the bank robberies themselves \u2013 and it\u2019s a reminder that apart from the Avengers movies, the Russo brothers also directed episodes of the TV comedy Arrested Development. Jack Reynor has a great supporting role as the loathsome drug dealer nicknamed Pills\u2019n\u2019Coke, familiarly known as \u201cPills\u201d, who becomes Cherry\u2019s longterm supplier and even his sort-of friend, although friendships are impossible in the soulless world of drug addiction. Pills finds himself being roped into being a getaway driver and then bank robber himself alongside Cherry, with terrible consequences which show us just how much Pills is really esteemed by his new non-friends. What is very interesting about the robberies here is that they show that in the moment-by-moment confrontation with the bank teller, there is a kind of negotiation, or bargaining. The teller might decide to offer a single wad of cash, but the gun-brandishing robber might angrily demand another wad before making a run for it \u2013 and all the time the clock is running down; the robber fears the police arriving and the teller fears being shot. It is a game of chicken in which the robber always loses in the end.

When almost 200 countries gather for the UN Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in November, they will do so under the shadow of two crises: a global pandemic that emerged out of nowhere and a climate emergency that nearly everybody has been able to see coming. Governments have spent trillions of pounds, dollars and euros in the battle against Covid-19. They have the incentive \u2013 as Boris Johnson puts it \u2013 to build back better, to channel that stimulus into the greening of the global economy. If ever there was a time to think big and be bold then this is it. Six years ago, the nations that will gather in Scotland later this year met in Paris, where they pledged to halt the increase in global temperatures and so avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. But most of the big emitters are not even meeting the modest commitments made in 2015, and the mercury continues to rise. In Glasgow, countries need to set more testing targets and lay out in detail how they intend to meet them. There\u2019s no question about it: the Cop26 is both the biggest and the most important summit Britain has ever hosted. Yet there is no guarantee that the conference will end in success, and warning signs abound that it might end in failure. That, as John Kerry noted earlier this week, would be a disaster. Joe Biden\u2019s climate envoy wants Glasgow to kickstart a decade of action. \u201cThis is the moment,\u201d Kerry has said. The fact that Biden reinstated the US to the Paris agreement within hours of being sworn in as president is one piece of good news in recent months. Washington plans to announce new carbon-reduction pledges shortly, something that would certainly not be happening had Donald Trump been re-elected. American engagement with the process at least makes it possible for Cop26 to end well. Kerry wants the US and the EU to put joint pressure on China, India and Brazil, to make firmer commitments to emissions reduction. Achieving this will not be easy. The reason there has not been a successfully completed round of global trade talks is that the US and the European Union make up a smaller proportion of the global economy than they did in the decades after the second world war. The leading emerging-market countries are no longer willing to sign up to deals cooked up between Washington and Brussels. Relations between the UK and China are at a low ebb, and Beijing doesn\u2019t seem eager to make life easier for Boris Johnson in the run-up to Glasgow. China is responsible for more than a quarter of CO2 emissions, and burns more coal than every other nation on Earth combined. President Xi Jinping has set a target for becoming a net-zero emissions country by 2060, but when the latest five-year plan was announced last week, environmentalists were hoping that China would set a 2025 target for reaching peak emissions. Those hopes were dashed. China\u2019s industrial strategy will remain heavily dependent on burning fossil fuels. In a way, this is not entirely surprising. While China\u2019s rapid growth over the past 40 years has eradicated extreme poverty, a large part of its population \u2013 hundreds of millions \u2013 are still poor by advanced country standards. For China\u2019s leaders, there is a trade-off between action to tackle the climate crisis and the desire to boost the incomes of its lowest-paid citizens by growing the economy. Beijing is not alone in this. In last week\u2019s budget, Rishi Sunak defended his decision to leave fuel duty unchanged, on the grounds that raising it would increase the cost of living, which is true enough. Similarly, the government has announced that it intends to help the aviation industry by cutting air passenger duty on domestic flights. For the UK as for China, there are often hard choices between the pressure to protect incomes and jobs, and the need to make progress on its climate-change agenda. Britain accounts for only 1% of global CO2 emissions, but it is reasonable for other, poorer countries to expect Johnson and his ministers to be setting an example in the run-up to Glasgow. If the prime minister thinks he can busk his way to success by turning on the charm at the last minute, he is sorely mistaken. International conferences fail because insufficient progress has been made in the months leading up to them. If the hard bargaining is left to the conference itself, then it\u2019s far too late. Seen from this perspective, preparations for Glasgow are not going well. Poor countries say, with justification, that rich countries have historically been responsible for the heating of the planet, and if they now want green growth then they are going to have pay for it. There could hardly have been a worse time for Britain to cut its aid budget. Similarly, the budget was an opportunity for the government to let the rest of the world know that it was serious about speeding up the UK\u2019s progress to net zero. As someone who believes that tax incentives matter, Rishi Sunak could have scrapped VAT for people retro-fitting their homes. He could have announced steps to improve and better fund the government\u2019s green home grants, which subsidise energy efficiency. He could have framed the UK\u2019s recovery from the pandemic as a Green New Deal. Instead of which, there were a few modest announcements \u2013 a new national infrastructure bank and a net-zero innovation fund \u2013 that will certainly not have persuaded China, or any other developing country, of the need to show willing in the buildup to Glasgow. Their message to the UK will be: if you want us to get serious, get serious yourself.

The high court ruled that compensation should be given and on Tuesday announced the amounts. The court also ordered the police to investigate the officers named in the allegations. Richard Chimwendo Banda, minister of homeland security, said officers would appear before an independent police commission. He added that the ministry would not appeal against the high court decision. Immaculate Maluza, president of the Women Lawyers Association, said the compensation would help the women move on from what she described as a traumatic experience. \u201cThis is progress and this is really good news. In terms of the amount, we\u2019ve talked to the women and we\u2019re waiting for feedback from them in terms of how they feel about the ruling,\u201d Maluza said. \u201cWe intend to pursue the matter to its logical conclusion.

Two of Klimaliste\u2019s (Climate List) founders were leaders of the student climate strikes sparked by Greta Thunberg in 2019. The party was set up less than six months ago with policies aimed at ensuring the Paris agreement climate pledges are not breached. It is on the ballot for this weekend\u2019s elections in the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The founders, all of whom are under 35, say they felt they had no choice: they live in the only state in Germany led by the Green party, yet they see more support going to the powerful local car industry than to renewable energy. One of Klimaliste\u2019s early successes was to push the other parties in the state government, including the Greens, to incorporate the 2016 Paris pledge to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels into their manifesto programmes.

Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images    Some members considered this job done and left to reassert their support for the Greens. Other members did not trust the other parties to act on their promises, so they stayed. Klimaliste\u2019s policies include a total switch to renewables within five years, a fair transition away from fossil fuels, the introduction of a citizens\u2019 assembly and lowering the voting age. To run in the election, the founders had to register Klimaliste as a party, recruit two candidates for each of the 70 districts in the state and collect 5,000 signatures \u2013 all during the pandemic. One candidate, Cordula Markert, 30, who spent her last two birthdays camping out with Extinction Rebellion, says the processes for starting a party were designed for a pre-digital era and there were times when she thought they may not make it through the bureaucratic quagmire. Markert admits that the party\u2019s flat organisational structure can be inefficient but says it models the kind of direct democracy Klimaliste would like to see in action. Since September 2020 the party has grown to about 450 members, many of them activists and scientists. In part, Klimaliste is a product of the disappointment many members feel towards the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Green party, which they believe has made too many compromises for the sake of power and popularity and has not been bold enough in responding to the climate emergency. Polls suggest the Greens will secure a solid victory in this weekend\u2019s vote, but Klimaliste hopes to attract disillusioned Greens and a large proportion of the 500,000 first-time voters. Talks are under way about whether Klimaliste should fight in the central government elections this autumn, but some members are concerned about undermining the Green vote. Klimaliste Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is part of a network that started in 2019 in Erlangen, Bavaria. Sebastian Hornschild and fellow Fridays for Future strikers were not satisfied that their demonstrations were doing enough and set up Klimaliste to run in their municipal elections. They won two seats and Hornschild, 31, is now a Klimaliste city councillor.

The vigil, titled Reclaim These Streets, will take place on Clapham Common bandstand at 6pm on Saturday, near where Everard was last seen as she made her way home to Brixton last week. The 33-year-old marketing executive vanished after leaving a friend\u2019s house in Clapham at about 9pm on Wednesday and beginning a 50-minute walk home. A serving Metropolitan police officer has been arrested for her suspected kidnapping and murder, and investigators searching for her found human remains in woodland in Ashford, Kent. The remains have not yet been identified. A woman was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender. Since Everard went missing, social media has been flooded with women sharing their own experiences of constant safety fears when out in public, particularly at night, as well as advice for men on ways to help prevent this. The event\u2019s Facebook page states that the vigil is for and about all women who have felt unsafe, and is open to all. Attenders are invited to \u201cbring a light to remember those we\u2019ve lost\u201d. Organisers said: \u201cIt\u2019s wrong that the response to violence against women requires women to behave differently. Women are not the problem. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been following the tragic case of Sarah Everard over the last week. This is a vigil for Sarah, but also for all women who feel unsafe, who go missing from our streets and who face violence every day.\u201d Attenders are told they must observe social distancing and wear a mask, and are also encouraged to use the NHS contact-tracing app. A silent vigil was held outside New Scotland Yard on Wednesday as police gave an update on the investigation. Everard\u2019s disappearance has felt overwhelmingly close to home for many women, who have shared their own personal experiences of sexual harassment, abuse and being made to feel scared and unsafe in public spaces. Many have pointed out that this was often despite them having gone out of their way to be hyper-vigilant and avoid potentially unsafe situations, employing measures instilled in them since childhood. This includes updating friends when they have made it home, taking lengthy detours and sticking to well-lit streets, talking on the phone as a deterrent, clutching their keys, and wearing comfortable shoes in case they need to run. It has spurred a conversation online about what men can do to be more effective allies to women, which prompted the sharing of tips on how men can change their behaviour so their presence does not make women feel uncomfortable. Being active bystanders and intervening if someone looks uncomfortable, giving space and crossing the road, not blocking paths, and calling out problematic behaviour from their friends were among the suggestions for what men could do to help. Better educating men and boys on these experiences was deemed significant if societal attitudes toward women\u2019s safety were to change. One woman tweeted: \u201cSarah Everard did everything we, as women, are \u2018meant\u2019 to do. It\u2019s stuff that we have to think about, but shouldn\u2019t \u2013 main roads, bright clothes, calling loved ones. And it didn\u2019t work, because we aren\u2019t the issue.\u201d Another said: \u201cThe fact that basically every woman on here is freaked out because we all feel like we could have easily been Sarah Everard says it all really.\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Diane Keaton\u2019s 10 best performances \u2013 ranked!", "full_article": "10. Sleeper (1973) Some of the jokes in Sleeper are as dated as the special effects (and they looked creaky enough nearly 50 years ago). But Keaton is ethereally lovely as Luna, a socialite from the future. As always, there is an intelligence to her performance that lifts her above the weaker material, such as Woody Allen\u2019s character floating around a field in a hydrovac suit. 9. Marvin\u2019s Room (1996)     Comedy with clout ... Keaton and Leonardo DiCaprio in Marvin\u2019s Room. Photograph: Tribeca Productions/Allstar    It is strange that Keaton is usually thought of as a comic actor, because she has done a hell of a lot of melodrama, including this, for which she got one of her four Oscar nominations. She plays Bessie, the \u201cgood\u201d sister, who has been looking after her father (Hume Cronyn) while her \u201cbad\u201d sister, Lee (Meryl Streep), has been sort-of raising her mentally ill son, Hank (Leonardo DiCaprio). The family reunites when Bessie is diagnosed with leukaemia. Despite the premise, the movie is not slushy, with Keaton giving a performance that balances comedy and emotion. 8. The First Wives Club (1996) I have so much time for Keaton\u2019s 90s comedies, from Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993) to Father of the Bride (1991), and The First Wives Club sums up her strengths in all of them. She is a great team player, leaving the bigger comedy to Goldie Hawn and Bette Midler, but her on-screen charisma is irresistibly empathic. She plays Annie, whose emotional fool of a husband routinely takes her for granted, until she finally finds a way to take revenge. It is the 9 to 5 of the 90s, with Keaton in the Jane Fonda role, but she makes it her own. 7. Something\u2019s Gotta Give (2003)     Extremely endearing ... Jack Nicholson and Keaton in Something\u2019s Gotta Give. Photograph: Warner Bros/Allstar    You would need a doctor\u2019s prescription to find something more comforting than a Nancy Meyers movie; as the US journalist Rachel Handler said recently, Something\u2019s Gotta Give \u201cis like if you turned Meyers herself into a bottle of white wine and chugged it\u201d. Keaton is extremely endearing as Meyers\u2019 alter ego of sorts, a playwright who, through plot machinations best not investigated too closely, ends up being wooed by Keanu Reeves and Jack Nicholson simultaneously. You need to be a fleet-footed performer to be in a Meyers film and not come across as smug/annoying. Keaton is that performer. 6. Shoot the Moon (1982) Like Kramer vs Kramer, Shoot the Moon is about divorce, but whereas Kramer places all the blame on the selfish mother, here the finger is pointed squarely at the father (Albert Finney). Keaton plays the alternately furious and heartbroken wife. Movies about divorce are rarely subtle, with characters sketched in black and white, but Keaton doesn\u2019t go for the simply downtrodden, even when confronting her husband about his affair. The joy she derives from her own affair is sweetly realised. 5. The Godfather: Part II (1974)     Emotional heart ... Keaton in The Godfather: Part II. Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock    The first Godfather film ends with Michael (Al Pacino) shutting out Keaton\u2019s character, Kay, but in the second film she brings herself to the centre of what is otherwise a monument to machismo. Her lovely face is the film\u2019s conscience, while the scene in which she tells Michael that she didn\u2019t miscarry their son, but rather terminated him to save him from \u201cthis Sicilian thing\u201d, is the movie\u2019s emotional heart. As much as the killing of Fredo, Kay\u2019s abortion is the definitive proof of Michael\u2019s fatal moral descent. 4. Baby Boom (1987) Sure, Keaton\u2019s first film with her longterm collaborator Meyers doesn\u2019t have the dramatic clout of, say, Looking for Mr Goodbar (1977), but it has endured a lot better. Keaton is deliciously believable playing against type as a gung-ho Wall Street type whose life comes undone when she unexpectedly inherits a baby. Often dismissed as fluff, Baby Boom is one of the great feminist-lite films and Keaton deftly moves between drama and full-on slapstick.  3. Manhattan (1979)     An ode to New York ... Woody Allen and Keaton in Manhattan. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar    It is almost impossible to talk about Manhattan without descending into arguments about Allen\u2019s morality. But let\u2019s focus for now on Keaton\u2019s performance, as the enjoyably absurd Mary. Only Allen\u2019s greatest collaborators can take his lines and put their personality on them, instead of reciting them in an Allen-esque rhythm, and Keaton does this better than anyone. The scene of Mary and Isaac\u2019s first date \u2013 Keaton and Allen clearly enjoying being with one another while New York looks impossibly beautiful around them \u2013 is one of the great movie date scenes. Allen and Keaton\u2019s friendship is the warm heart of this movie. 2. Reds (1981) Like Keaton\u2019s most famous film, Annie Hall, Reds was written and directed by, and stars, one of Keaton\u2019s exes: Warren Beatty, in this case. As in Annie Hall, she dominates what could easily have been the man\u2019s vanity project. Reds is ostensibly a biopic of John Reed (Beatty), the US communist activist, but Keaton\u2019s performance as his partner, Louise Bryant, is the more involving. The scenes in which she stands up to Reed, about his infidelity, and then Eugene O\u2019Neill (Jack Nicholson), for his cruelty, should be required viewing for those who dismiss Keaton as a ditz. 1. Annie Hall (1977)     Defining role ... Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall. Photograph: United Artists/Allstar    Not just Keaton\u2019s most celebrated performance, but one of the most memorable performances of all time. Allen wrote it for her, using Keaton\u2019s real surname, and only she could have captured Annie\u2019s sweetness and fragility without descending into cloying irritation or, worse, becoming a proto manic pixie dream girl. Allen wanted the movie to be about the inability of his character, Alvy, to feel joy; Alvy is certainly the captain of this film\u2019s ship, narrating it and dominating the action. But Annie\u2019s warmth towers over Alvy\u2019s depressive comedy, like a sunflower bringing light to a dark patch of the garden. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 March 2021 to more accurately describe the final scene of The Godfather and to replace an image from The Godfather with one from The Godfather: Part II.

As product development manager at Philips, Ottens twice revolutionised the world of music, but he remained modest to the end. \u201cWe were little boys who had fun playing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel like we were doing anything big. It was a kind of sport.\u201d Ottens, born on 21 June 1926, showed an early interest in engineering, building a radio as a teenager through which he and his parents could receive Radio Oranje during Germany\u2019s wartime occupation of the Netherlands. He equipped the device with a directional antenna that he called a \u201cGermanenfilter\u201d because it could avoid the jammers used by the Nazi regime. Following the war, Ottens obtained an engineering degree, and he started work at the Philips factory in Hasselt, Belgium, in 1952. Eight years later he was promoted to head of the company\u2019s newly established product development department, and within a year he unveiled the EL 3585, Philips\u2019s first portable tape recorder, which would go on to sell more than a million units. But it was two years later that Ottens made the biggest breakthrough of his life \u2013 born out of annoyance with the clumsy and large reel-to-reel tape systems of the time. \u201cThe cassette tape was invented out of irritation about the existing tape recorder, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d he would later say. Ottens\u2019s idea was that the cassette tape that should fit in the inside pocket of his jacket. In 1963 the first tape was presented to the world at an electronics fair in Berlin with the tagline \u201cSmaller than a pack of cigarettes!\u201d     Ottens did not back the recent resurgence of the cassette tape. Photograph: Jerry Lampen/EPA    Photographs of the invention made their way to Japan, where substandard copies started to emerge. Ottens made agreements with Sony for the patented Philips mechanism to be the standard. It led to the mixtapes beloved by teenagers across the world and the frustration of the unspooled tape, albeit largely fixable with the insertion and twirl of a disposable pen. In 1972 Ottens became director of audio at Philips\u2019 NatLab, where he became involved in the next major music innovation: the CD. A collaboration was entered into with Sony and in 1980 the 12cm Philips-Sony CD standard was ready for the world. More than 100bn cassette tapes and 200bn CDs have been sold. When asked about his regrets, Ottens lamented that Sony had brought out the first Walkman. \u201cIt still hurts that we didn\u2019t have one,\u201d he said. Ottens, who died on Saturday, had little patience with the renewed popularity of the cassette tape \u2013 or even vinyl. \u201cNothing can match the sound of the CD,\u201d he had told the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad. \u201cIt is absolutely noise and rumble-free.

The timing is not right for this book, which is a damning assessment of how the UK government of Boris Johnson mishandled almost every aspect of the coronavirus crisis, so that Britain suffered both the highest death toll in Europe and an economic slump more devastating than in any other G7 nation. The timing is off because of the one thing the government got right. At this moment, polls suggest a nation grateful to be vaccinated efficiently and at speed, with case numbers and deaths falling daily, schools open once more and the first sound of the key being turned on a lockdown that has seemed to last for ever. Spring is in the air and people are itching to break free. Those chunky Tory poll leads do not suggest a public eager to immerse itself in the horrors of the last year and work out what went wrong and who to blame. That time will come, however, and when it does, this book will serve well as the charge sheet. More than that, it reads like the first draft of the report that will one day be delivered by the inevitable public inquiry, even if it is balder and more scathing than those texts, written in mandarin English \u2013 indirect, coded, implied \u2013 usually dare to be. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what an actual catalogue of disaster might look like, look no further. Failures of State is a Christmas-at-Argos sized catalogue of the government\u2019s errors, page after page filled with its mistakes, misjudgments and even its possibly actionable crimes (it quotes lawyers who believe Johnson could be charged with \u201cgross negligence manslaughter\u201d). The authors are Jonathan Calvert and George Arbuthnott, investigative journalists and custodians of the storied Insight brand at the Sunday Times. There might be the odd Guardian reader who assumes the Murdoch press would never lay a glove on this Tory government. They should have been parted from that misconception when Calvert and Arbuthnott published last April what they tell us is the most read story in the online history of the Times or Sunday Times, an evisceration of Johnson\u2019s pandemic response that was headlined \u201cCoronavirus: 38 days when Britain sleepwalked into disaster\u201d, revealing among other things that Johnson had failed to attend the first five Cobra meetings called to marshal the UK\u2019s response. But Failures of State surely settles the matter.     Michael Gove in Downing Street, September 2020. Photograph: Barcroft Media/Getty Images    Some acts of negligence are, like that serial Cobra truancy, already well known. Still, there is a value in having laid out before you just how costly, for example, Johnson\u2019s thrice-repeated delay in introducing lockdown proved to be. Three times it was screamingly obvious that the public would have to stay at home if the virus were to be reined in, and three times Johnson waited and waited: in March, in September and again this winter. The authors cite Imperial College modelling, which found that over the course of the combined 68 days that Johnson hesitated before imposing those three lockdowns, the number of infections that spread across Britain totalled 4.5m. \u201cOn each occasion, he had been advised to act immediately.\u201d There is poor judgment wherever you look, leaving the reader by turns baffled and furious all over again. We read of the cabinet row in late March, when the first lockdown had already begun, over whether to close the country\u2019s borders to flights from known virus hotspots. No, said the Foreign Office: that would complicate efforts to bring home Brits stranded abroad. All right, thinks the reader, then surely the government would close the borders once all returning Brits were safely back. But no. The flights kept coming. There are lesser-known horrors in the catalogue too. The authors are keen to explode the comforting narrative that the NHS coped with the pandemic even at its peak, and that everyone got the care they needed. They report that some hospitals were forced to ration treatment according to a set of guidelines that struck doctors and nurses as \u201cNazi-like\u201d, denying intensive care to those who scored too high on three metrics: age, frailty and underlying conditions. Whole categories of people \u2013 the old, the weak, the disabled \u2013 were denied the critical care that might have saved their lives. Incredibly, the guidelines were so rigorously enforced that in one Midlands hospital, dozens of intensive care beds lay empty, kept free for younger, fitter patients, while those over-75 were left dying on regular wards, without even being offered non-invasive ventilation. It meant that of the patients who died at the height of the pandemic in April, just 10% had received any intensive care.    The \u00a3185,000 a year head of Public Health England breezily admitted that his public health credentials could fit 'on a postage stamp'    Word of all this hardly reached beyond the doctors, nurses and families who suffered through it. An omerta was imposed on hospitals to keep the reality on the wards hidden. The Unison trade union alleges that managers at Nottingham\u2019s Queen\u2019s medical centre, for example, locked away vital PPE \u201cas punishment\u201d after staff on a Covid ward raised concerns. Meanwhile, Matt Hancock was on TV saying everything was under control. It\u2019s all here, the \u00a3185,000 a year head of Public Health England who breezily admitted that his public health credentials could fit \u201con a postage stamp\u201d, along with the national stockpile of PPE supplies that had, thanks to austerity, been left to moulder in a Merseyside warehouse, much of it well past its use-by date. The shelves were full of respirators whose true expiry date was 2012, the labels simply replaced with new ones giving an end date of 2016, with another label placed on top of that one, claiming the devices were suitable for use in 2020. What explains this failure upon failure? The book describes \u201cgovernment by ADHD\u201d, with ministers from Johnson down making crucial decisions \u201con the hoof\u201d or \u201cwinging it\u201d and hoping for the best. There\u2019s an accusing finger pointed very directly at Rishi Sunak for ignoring advice and pushing to keep things open in the name of kickstarting the economy, even though it was obvious that what would hurt the economy most would be lockdowns that had to run long because they came too late. (By contrast, Michael Gove is regularly presented as the voice of sober realism in the face of the pandemic, a gloss which has one wondering if the loquacious minister might perhaps have been a generous source to two journalists working for his former employer at Times Newspapers.) Above all, it describes a government that only had eyes for Brexit, that had diverted whatever contingency planning capacity it had to a no-deal scenario rather than to a looming pandemic.     A lateral flow testing centre in Portsmouth, February 2021. Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images    The authors have little patience for Johnson\u2019s defence that any failings are only visible now with the benefit of what the PM likes to call the \u201cretrospectoscope\u201d. By way of rebuttal, they reproduce the warnings scientists were giving back in January 2020, spelling out the dangers and urging swift action. Two are quoted, accusing Downing Street of twisting their words to suggest that it was they, the experts, who had underestimated the severity of the threat, a move Richard Horton, editor of the Lancet, calls a \u201cKremlinesque\u201d attempt at \u201cgovernment disinformation\u201d. As Horton puts it: \u201cThey really are scared that the verdict of history is going to condemn them for contributing to the deaths of tens of thousands of British citizens \u2026 They are desperately trying to rewrite the timeline of what happened. And we must not let them do that.\u201d Calvert and Arbuthnott have exposed the failings of Johnson, his ministers, advisers and many others. What, perhaps, is missing \u2013 besides a fuller look at the scandal of test and trace, with its indefensible \u00a337bn price tag \u2013 is the larger accusation hinted at in the title: the failures of the British state that made this disaster likely, regardless of who was in charge. Is there a more deep-rooted arrogance and complacency, a lack of care, that went beyond, and predated, Johnson and Dominic Cummings? Maybe that question will have to wait. For now, this is the book to throw at those who were meant to protect the British public and failed in their duty. This vaccine spring may not be the moment for that reckoning.

A record defeat by England prompted their experienced half-backs Camille Lopez and Morgan Parra to publicly question the way the side were coached, or not coached in their words. They were dropped for the next match and replaced by Romain Ntamack and Antoine Dupont, hope emerging from despair. France were coached then by Jacques Brunel. He was hastily appointed after the national side\u2019s messy divorce with Guy Nov\u00e8s. As a pal of the French Rugby Federation\u2019s president, Bernard Laporte, he was only too happy to sign a pre-nup while his employers searched for a more suitable partner.   Related: Free-flowing Wales shaping up to be unlikely Six Nations champions      That turned out to be Fabien Galthi\u00e9, who was dropped into Brunel\u2019s management team for the 2019 World Cup. By the end of the tournament, the team bore more of his imprint than that of the nominal head coach, with Charles Ollivon and Gr\u00e9gory Alldritt installed in the back row, Bernard Le Roux at lock and Virimi Vakatawa and Ga\u00ebl Fickou in midfield; not to forget Ntamack and Dupont. The only two starters at Twickenham two years ago who were in the team that played Ireland in France\u2019s most recent match in this year\u2019s Six Nations were Damian Penaud and Fickou, who was on the wing that afternoon. That compares with six in the 2019 quarter-final defeat by Wales, a side that included Vakatawa and Ntamack, who missed the Dublin encounter through injury. France were a shambles two years ago. They turned up at Twickenham to face a side renowned for their kicking without a recognised full-back and were duly exposed. England secured the try bonus point before half-time against a team that had won only seven Six Nations matches since the 2015 World Cup and just two away from Paris, against Italy and Scotland.

Jones is loyal to players who have served him, the England head coach needing more than one or two off-days to persuade him to contemplate whether there has been a paradigm shift.   Related: Pirates' stellar win offers lessons for Eddie Jones and English rugby | Robert Kitson    One question is whether England are a side more in the image of Farrell, who made his Test debut in 2012, than Jones, who pitched up four years later. In tournaments Jones has used two fly-halves, Farrell and George Ford, regularly deploying the former at inside-centre. Marcus Smith and Jacob Umaga have been given a taste of life in the squad without coming near to selection, while Danny Cipriani was teased in the buildup to the World Cup before being omitted. Cipriani\u2019s one appearance under Jones came in the third Test against South Africa in 2018, when the series had been lost. His kick for Jonny May helped conjure victory but Farrell\u2019s facial expressions at times during the match indicated he did not have confidence in the fly-half who had replaced someone with whom he went back a long way, Ford. Jones never discusses the rugby reasons behind his decisions to leave out players. His one observation about Cipriani was that he did not think that the player would be content with a bit-part role in the squad; he was someone who either had to be first-choice or overlooked. If Cipriani struggled to integrate himself in the squad in South Africa, was that more down to him or his captain? Was he welcome?     Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re awards a penalty against England in Cardiff. Eddie Jones\u2019s side did not adjust to how the breakdown was being refereed. Photograph: David Rogers/The RFU Collection/Getty Images    Farrell has come to define England with his competitiveness, attention to detail, defensive organisation and ability to execute a gameplan, but as Jones anticipates a greater emphasis on more open, unstructured play leading up to the 2023 World Cup, he will have to consider whether he needs someone more instinctive at the helm. It is not that England are now where France were two years ago, far from it, but the side that dismantled New Zealand in the World Cup semi-final has scarcely been seen since and the recurrent failure to react to events, highlighted by the failure to adapt to the way Pascal Ga\u00fcz\u00e8re refereed the breakdown in Cardiff, is a weakness that will prevent them becoming, in Jones\u2019s words, the greatest team the world has ever seen.     Sign up for the Breakdown.   The word culture was used a lot by the previous England regime, and perhaps now is the time for another change. France used to alter their side for the sake of it and the result was wretched inconsistency, but the danger of making few voluntary changes is a feeling of comfort that turns into complacency, cancerous in a competitive environment. Two years ago, France arrived at Twickenham with no discernible plan. All that could be said about them was that they never gave up. The considerable distance between the sides then has closed and, after winning in Cardiff last year for the first time in a decade and ending a 10-year drought in Dublin last month, France now have only Twickenham to topple. A reaction to the defeat in Wales will not be enough for England: they need to start using their heads. \u2022 This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

Who could blame her? She was 86 years old and had recently suffered from a stroke and a broken hip, caused by a fall at home. Besides, she had presided over one of country music\u2019s most extraordinary careers: since 1960, she has cut an authentically groundbreaking figure, such a trailblazer for women in country that one writer suggested most modern female country artists could be called Lynettes. Her brand of \u201cadvocacy for ordinary women\u201d \u2013 she is \u201cnot a big fan\u201d of the term \u201cfeminist\u201d, considering it to be insufficiently concerned with working-class women \u2013 bordered on the confrontational, at least by the conservative standards of Nashville.     Loretta Lynn: Still Woman Enough album cover Photograph: Publicity image    The horrified reaction to her 1975 single The Pill is legendary \u2013 the song was suppressed for three years, then banned by country radio stations on release \u2013 but it\u2019s just one in a succession of two-fisted reproaches of patriarchal mores. On 2018\u2019s Wouldn\u2019t It Be Great? \u2013 an album recorded before, but released after, her illness \u2013 she re-recorded one classic example, 1967\u2019s Don\u2019t Come Home A-Drinkin\u2019, a song that hides a dark saga of sexual consent behind its wry humour. She did the same with her autobiographical theme song Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter. It felt like a neat way of tying things up: that, one might have assumed, was that. And yet, here we are, three years on, with Lynn weeks away from her 89th birthday and a new album named after her second volume of autobiography. Its cover depicts the singer clad in one of her trademark gowns, sitting on a throne and wearing an expression that suggests \u2013 as so many of her songs do \u2013 a woman who\u2019s had enough of your bullshit, or perhaps a woman who\u2019s heard you\u2019ve been spreading rumours about her retirement and isn\u2019t terribly pleased about it. Its contents speak of an understandable decline in songwriting productivity \u2013 there\u2019s only one new Lynn original, the title track, co-written with her daughter; Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter makes yet another appearance, this time as a recitation of the lyrics set to music \u2013 but her voice sounds frankly astonishing. The woman singing I Wanna Be Free has a slightly flintier tone than the woman who first recorded it 50 years ago, but she still sounds strident and authoritative: there\u2019s none of the diminution in clout you might expect from someone whose professional career is now into its seventh decade. Certainly, her guest stars \u2013 Reba McEntire, Carrie Underwood, Tanya Tucker and Margo Price \u2013 never feel like they\u2019re there to do the heavy lifting vocally, or bolster a waning talent: they sound like they\u2019re sparring with her, particularly Price, who performs on a version of 1971\u2019s One\u2019s on the Way, a classic Lynn saga of domestic strife (albeit one written by Shel Silverstein, best-known as the author of Johnny Cash\u2019s A Boy Named Sue). The cultural references \u2013 Liz Taylor, Raquel Welch, Jackie Onassis \u2013 might have dated, but the song\u2019s theme seems timeless: it deals with the gulf between a perfectly airbrushed world of celebrity and the reality of daily life, as relevant in the Instagram age as it was when it was written.           Loretta Lynn and Margo Price discuss the making of One\u2019s on the Way \u2013 video    Other covers delve so deep into country\u2019s history that Hank Williams\u2019 I Saw the Light \u2013 breezily rendered by Lynn here \u2013 counts as relatively recent, the original merely having been recorded in 1948. There are three songs from the 1930s oeuvre of the Carter Family and the standard Old Kentucky Home, a song first published in 1853. Whether religious or secular in theme, they\u2019re linked by a tone of steely determination that suits Lynn perfectly. The protagonist of I\u2019ll Be All Smiles Tonight declines to show weakness while watching the man she loves marry someone else; the hard-boiled stoicism of I Don\u2019t Feel at Home Anymore found popularity among dust bowl refugees in the 1930s, its tone of acceptance so infuriating Woody Guthrie that he rewrote it, throwing in a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s racist father for good measure. Guthrie saw the song as meek, but Lynn sings it with an affecting combination of joy and conviction.   Related: Sign up for the Sleeve Notes email: music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras    It ends with a rerecording of her 1966 hit You Ain\u2019t Woman Enough (To Take My Man) as a duet with Tanya Tucker, a song characteristic of what you might call the other side of Loretta Lynn: when she wasn\u2019t calling out men, she was frequently to be found offering female rivals out for a fight. The subject of You Ain\u2019t Woman Enough fares better than that of 1968\u2019s Fist City (\u201cI\u2019ll grab you by the hair of your head and lift you off the ground\u201d) but not much. \u201cFor you to get to him, I\u2019ll have to move over,\u201d she sings, \u201cand I\u2019m gonna stand right here \u2013 it\u2019ll be over my dead body.\u201d Delightfully enough, she sounds like she means every word: there\u2019s a toughness that doubtless accounts for Still Woman Enough\u2019s very existence.

The past 18 months saw political defeats for the left on both sides of the Atlantic. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party came to an end after a resounding Conservative victory. The Bernie Sanders campaign went down at the hands of the Democrat establishment. And yet the bitter irony of 2020 was that just as the political hopes of the left were dashed, the strategic analysis of the Green New Deal \u2013 the centrepiece of its policy vision \u2013 was spectacularly vindicated. The Green New Deal demanded that social and economic policy should be oriented towards the immediate planetary challenge of the environment. Its proponents, groups such as the Sunrise Movement, put a \u201cjust transition\u201d front and centre; this means fairly managing the social harms such as unemployment that would arise from an accelerated shift away from fossil fuels. Then, as if on cue, the coronavirus arrived, and delivered a devastating \u201cinequality shock\u201d forcing even the likes of the Financial Times to talk about a new social contract. The Green New Deal\u2019s politics emerged from a recognition of the fact that there was unfinished business from the financial crisis of 2008; climate activists warned that we were harnessed to a dangerous financial flywheel and demanded that finance be turned in a constructive direction. The thinking was based on the notion that the status quo was the one thing that we could not have: the events of 2020 confirmed precisely how dangerous and precarious our reality is. In the US, this feeling was compounded by Donald Trump\u2019s terrifying antics and the killing of George Floyd. Even Joe Biden, as centrist as it gets, has been moved to speak of four converging crises \u2013 Covid-19, the economy, racial justice and the climate. Nor is this merely a rhetorical framing. The Biden administration has assimilated a large part of the Sanders agenda. The double stimulus programmes planned for 2021 are unprecedented. The administration is clearly serious about climate. It is forced, by the balance of power inside the Democratic party, to put race and environmental justice at the heart of its policies. This assimilation of the left programme into the centre is made possible by victory. It is based on a confidence that a broad-church progressive coalition can win a majority in the US. Furthermore, the Republicans have done the Democrats the favour of vacating the middle ground almost entirely. The contrast to the UK is painful. Reeling from its bitter defeat, languishing in the opinion polls, Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour party diagnoses a polycrisis too, but it consists not of issues of global significance, but of Brexit, the collapse of the \u201cred wall\u201d and the question of Scotland. Questions of identity overshadow everything. Rather than seriously questioning what the nation might be, as the combination of Trump and Black Lives Matter is forcing liberal America to do, Labour appears to be content with trying to reclaim the union flag from the Conservative party. Starmer\u2019s long-awaited \u201cbig speech\u201d last month was an exercise in sophomoric national cliche. He managed to be sentimental even in the passages about British business. References to the blitz and 1945 formed the anchor. The climate crisis got a single line, with one other passing reference. The Mais lecture by the shadow chancellor, in January, was weightier. Unlike Starmer, Anneliese Dodds did in fact seriously discuss the climate emergency, but it is no longer the organising framework that it once was, no longer the pacesetter, the imperative to action. The only thing that matters is to convince some key voters that Labour is responsible enough to be trusted as a steward of the economy.  Though \u201cacceleration\u201d was one of Dodds\u2019s key terms \u2013 a reference to the way the pandemic has amplified pre-existing trends such as flexible working and digitalisation \u2013 she managed nevertheless to offer a curiously muted vision of the huge challenges facing the UK and the world economy. No doubt the pollsters have fine-tuned these messages with target segments of the electorate. But if you do not belong to that audience, if you understand your identity to be complex and multiple, if you have ever been on the bitter end of the politics of patriotism, then flag-waving repels. If a little thought about society and politics has taught you to regard \u201ccommon sense\u201d as the most dangerous of snares, you cannot but worry about a party so desperate to please the Daily Mail. Labour\u2019s retreat from radicalism means that the initiative belongs to the Johnson government. Having done Brexit, it can look to the future. It leads even on climate. After destroying the miners union in the 1980s, the Tories may end up presiding over historic decarbonisation. After vaccines they will claim Britain\u2019s hosting of Cop26 as a victory too. Ahead of the 2024 election, the Tories will no doubt pivot to \u201cfiscal responsibility\u201d, but as the budget makes clear, they are spending as the situation demands. Labour is left to harp on value for money. The independent Bank of England created by Gordon Brown is now merrily buying bonds to finance Rishi Sunak\u2019s spending. Whereas experts aligned with the Labour party were once leading a global conversation about redefining central bank independence in a progressive direction, the shadow chancellor now proposes to treat its independence as inviolable. Not so the Tory chancellor, who has added climate to the bank\u2019s mandate. No doubt the Corbynite left was too in love with its own radicalism. But the Green New Deal was not radicalism for its own sake. It was radical because reality demanded it. Faced with the 2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath, the world historic presence of China, Trump, the escalating climate crisis, and an unprecedented global pandemic, what more is needed to demonstrate this point? A politics that does not want to mobilise around these challenges, which prefers to deal in patriotic pastiche, forfeits any claim to be progressive. The disinhibited politics of the new global right recognises this radical reality, though in the form of fantasy, denial and conspiracy. Global capital is swinging full tilt behind its own version of a Green New Deal. Hundreds of billions is now sloshing into renewable energy. The restructuring and job losses about to happen in the global automotive industry will put every previous reorganisation in the shade. In the age of the great acceleration, Corbyn\u2019s politics at least rose to the challenge of recognising that the future would be different. Labour\u2019s new look \u2013 the Little Britain to come \u2013 promises a nostalgic road back to the future. It is, in reality, a dangerous dead end.

After a formative period at the Post Office research labs, Keele University and Mitel Telecom, he left in 1985 with Adrian Anderson and me to establish Ensigma, a company that quickly established itself as a leader in the research and development of digital speech and audio applications, with uses in mobile telephony, broadcasting and automated speech recognition systems. Mike was born in Preston, to Ethel (nee Glover), a weaver and housewife, and Stephen, a miner-cum-decorator. At Preston Catholic college, a local grammar, he met Elizabeth Mercer at a school dance, for once beating the cross-country champion across the floor. They married in 1969, by which time Mike was on a Post Office scholarship to study electrical engineering at Imperial College, London, supported throughout by extra work taken on by his parents. Mike had a strong business sense, as well as a razor-sharp mind and deep understanding of the engineering and technology that he worked on. Much of Ensigma\u2019s business derived from licensing designs for incorporation into semiconductors and third-party products. He was a strong believer in education and in the importance of the links between industry and universities. This was demonstrated by collaborations with the universities of Bristol, Swansea, East Anglia, Manchester and Liverpool (among others) that included projects, student and staff placements and joint publications. Mike had numerous patents and international papers in the field of speech recognition and speaker verification that are still being referenced today. In 2000 he negotiated a takeover that gave Ensigma the critical mass to compete successfully on the world stage. After being diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2005 he retired but worked as an honorary professor at Birmingham University, where he continued his research and supervised a number of PhD students. Mike was an immensely talented man of great determination, ambition, focus and great energy. Outside work, wine and classical music were great passions, and he was an early adopter of top end hi-fi equipment, including electro-static speakers that brooked no compromise in their place in his house.

A second sigh of relief as Adam Reynolds nails his conversion from the sideline.       9.42am GMT    Try! Melbourne 22-0 South Sydney    29 mins: Josh Mansour made the latest Souths error and the ball is back with the Storm. Munster breaks Johnston\u2019s tackle and is 5m out from the try line. Smith to Papenhuyzen to Bromwich. It\u2019ll be a miracle for Souths if they don\u2019t concede another try here. There was a brief shift in momentum during that tiny period of Souths possession but they keep coughing up the ball at key moments and the pressure has been building again. And there it is. Who is it? Papenhuyzen again. The man with the quirky haircut wriggles through a gap at the corner post. He diverts his conversion wide on this occasion but it matters little at this point.       9.35am GMT       26 mins: This could be a little chance for Souths.

And he\u2019ll have the conversion too, thank you very much. A penny for Wayne Bennett\u2019s thoughts right now. Souths have looked out of their depth against the premiers thus far.       9.25am GMT       16 mins: Souths are on the attack now and approaching the Storm\u2019s 30m line but the ball is down, as called by the referee and now Nelson Asofa-Solomona is off and replaced by Tui Kamikamica. Possession is back with the Storm.       9.21am GMT    Try! Melbourne 12-0 South Sydney    10 mins: The Storm are whispering sweet nothings into each other\u2019s ears and they are on a seamless attack from well inside their own half before Addo-Carr disappears in a puff of smoke. He is tackled but the next play brings the joy the hosts are after when Justin Olam picks up a pass from Papenhuyzen and races over the line. Papenhuyzen adds the extras.       9.17am GMT       8 mins:     That\u2019s the best three-minute opening to a season from a team I\u2019ve ever seen I reckon. #NRLStormSouths&mdash; Scott Bailey (@ScottBaileyAAP) March 11, 2021    Meanwhile, we\u2019ve just been given a demonstration on one of those new rules. The ball is over the sideline and the non-offending side here, South Sydney, a 10m, 20m or 30m restart, and they\u2019ve gone with the middle for Mitchell to play the ball.        9.12am GMT    And we\u2019re away! Try!    5 mins: The Storm are in possession their opening set features two offloads.The crowd are vocal, even at 50% capacity. This is the first time AAMI Park has hosted since the 2019 preliminary final against Canberra. Try! What about that! Reynolds kicks and Addo-Carr juggles and keeps the ball. Cody Walker is down and up as quickly as a six-again is called and Munster double steps and shimmies his way to the opening try. Some start to Melbourne\u2019s season.       9.03am GMT       Speaking of Mitchell and Papenhuyzen, these two are one of a couple of key match-ups. Storm No 1 Papenhuyzen had a breakout 2020 when he added goal-kicking to his repertoire, while his South counterpart Mitchell has put those teething issues and injuries of last season behind him and is one of the NRL\u2019s more eye-catching talents. And don\u2019t forget the battle at dummy-half. Brandon Smith is a gritty power player while Damien Cook boasts speed befitting a national under-15 flags champion and is a nightmare for fatigued defenders.       8.53am GMT       The new rules will undoubtedly make for a fast-pace contest will minimal stoppages. I\u2019m talking about six-again for 10-metre infringements and play-the-ball restarts. This is match will be something of a guinea pig (for the season proper), which generally means some sort of refereeing controversy could unfold. Worth noting also that both the Storm and Souths are the type of teams who\u2019ll likely handle this free-flowing-on-steroids type of game well. Fittler likes the rule changes. \u201cWe are trying to get more ball in play, so more football per game. Over the last three years there\u2019s been a gradual increase of two minutes per year. So it is up around 56 minutes per game ball in play. So the rule changes I like ...  ... penalties now for inside the 10 is going to be crucial for these two teams because I think these are the two teams that can take advantage of this rule the most. It is now just the six again. That means a lot of sides will be getting eight, nine, 10-tackle sets. Imagine Latrell Mitchell coming at your defence line after nine or 10 tackles consistently [or] Ryan Papenhuyzen.\u201d       8.42am GMT       Well pre-match coverage has just got under way and Freddy Fittler and Johnathan Thurston have just been introduced with a jovial \u201cHello boys!\u201d                   8.29am GMT       Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the state of these two teams. Simply speaking, both had sizeable wins in the condensed pre-season trials. The Storm beat Newcastle 30-10 and Souths made light work of St George Illawarra 48-16. Melbourne, of course, start the season without one Cameron Smith, who finally, FINALLY, announced his retirement decision. The mystery of the whole saga nearly killed us here at Guardian HQ. But now we know, which makes this game a first in almost two decades. How Bellamy\u2019s side cope without Smith\u2019s on-field management will no doubt have been a focus for the team \u2013 and Souths. Harry Grant was due to replace the ex-captain at hooker until he was sidelined with a knee injury, meaning Brandon Smith will wear No 9 for the first few weeks. Souths, meanwhile, are not expected to win at AAMI Park. It\u2019s never happened before and won\u2019t happen now. Simple as that. We\u2019ll see about that, shall we? Bennett\u2019s men are favourites among some bookies, and Latrell Mitchell has returned from injury and shown he is well settled at fullback. But here are those awful stats Souths must overcome tonight: *The Storm have won their first game of the NRL season since 2001 *Souths have never beaten Melbourne in Melbourne *Across 33 games at any stadium the Rabbitohs have beaten the Storm just five times and only twice in the past decade How about that, said the rat. Rabbitohs hooker Damien Cook knows it doesn\u2019t make for pleasant reading. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best record,\u201d Cook said this week. \u201cWe haven\u2019t won down there and I think Bellamy has got a good record of round one victories as well. But records are made to be broken. I enjoy it down there. \u201cOne of the good things about footy and all sports is you want to come up against the benchmark of the competition and at the moment they are, they have been for a while.\u201d       7.57am GMT       Well the news is still going on Channel Nine so we\u2019re a little while off from go time. In the interim, whet your appetite with a bit of Nick Tedeschi, who has previewed the season for you and I alike.

Welcome to our live coverage of the NRL\u2019s season opener. My time flies when off-seasons are fun. As per usual, this competition has sort of dodged Covid, if we are going to reminisce on the challenges confronted by the summer of cricket and tennis. But we will not, for the future awaits. Tonight that future consists of premiers Melbourne Storm v title challengers South Sydney, an enticing contest however you spin it. It is the post-Cameron Smith era, the where-will-Craig-Bellamy-and-Wayne-Bennett-end-up-next-year era, and a time of great contemplation for statisticians opining the fact the Storm have not lost a season opener since 2001 and never been beaten by the Rabbitohs in Melbourne. So much ahead tonight. Kick-off is at 8.05pm AEDT.

Instead it's geared up for war | Akin Olla", "full_article": "The George Floyd uprising that began in Minneapolis introduced the demand of defunding the police to the general public, empowered Black-led anti-police violence movements across the planet, generated policy changes in cities across the US, and most importantly built new organizations which have the capacity to fight for systemic change for the long haul. The uprising brought a lot of reforms and positive developments to its birth city, too, including a move to actually defund the Minneapolis police department and redistribute funds to services with a larger potential for eradicating both crime and poverty. Now, however, the Minneapolis and Minnesota governments are in the process of undoing that progress and moving in the opposite direction. The trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer who publicly killed 46-year-old George Floyd \u2013 and inadvertently triggered what may have been the largest protest movement in US history \u2013 began this week. Instead of becoming more transparent and committed to undoing the anti-Black image it has cultivated, the city of Minneapolis has quickly transformed itself into a 21st-century police state, pushing even beyond the hyper-militarization and violence that already plague police departments across the US. For a while it seemed that Minneapolis was headed on a better path. A veto-proof majority of city council members previously promised to dismantle the police department and build something better to replace it. Their attempts were dashed by the Minneapolis Charter Commission that shut down a ballot initiative that would have given voters the chance to abolish the police department in favor of a proposed department of community safety and violence prevention. By this winter, the summer\u2019s ambitions had been replaced by a renewed commitment to the status quo. The police budget was cut by a mere $8m \u2013 out of a total budget of $179m \u2013 and a proposal to modestly reduce the size of the police force was shot down by city council members and Mayor Jacob Frey, who would be more useful to the world as a Justin Trudeau impersonator than an elected official. While the cut is a step towards disinvesting in police, it pales in comparison to the city council\u2019s more genuinely radical rhetoric. Some of the blame for this policy about-face lies with the city\u2019s rising violent crime rate and the subsequent push by some within Minneapolis for increased policing. This uptick in crime has been seen across the country and may add fuel to fiery opposition to police abolition activism. In fact, adding more police is hardly ever the real solution to increased crime rates, though it is often the first that cities reach for. There is no conclusive evidence that the overpolicing of the 1990s and the rise of mass incarceration is what caused the decline in crime that occurred towards the end of that decade. A growing number of sociologists and other social scientists believe that there is a abundance of historical evidence that shows that violent crime, particularly murder, is deeply correlated with political instability and a lack of faith in government institutions. Considering the pandemic and decades of unresolved social crises like police violence against Black people (only one Minnesota police officer has been convicted for on-duty killing in recent history), it shouldn\u2019t surprise us that public trust in government is near historic lows. Increasing police presence, especially in moments of justified tension, will only continue this trend. That seems like the direction that the state of Minnesota, and Minneapolis more specifically, is headed as they prepare for protests in response to a potential acquittal of yet another police officer caught executing someone on camera. Governor Tim Walz has issued an order authorizing national guard troops to be sent into Minneapolis at the request of Frey. The governor has also proposed $35m in state aid to fund the deployment of police officers from across the state to support the Minneapolis police department in the case of \u201cextraordinary public safety events\u201d. The state is also coordinating with the FBI, the federal joint terrorism taskforce, and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Hennepin county government center, the location of the trial, is being turned into a fortress. Several layers of high-security barbed-wire fences line the area around the center and a few buildings around it; they are reinforced with large concrete barriers which, combined with up to 2,000 national guard soldiers, give the impression that the city is ready to fight its own people. Speaking to ABC News, Kandace Montgomery, the current co-director of the local Black liberation organization Black Visions, responded to the city\u2019s preparations: \u201cAs the people of Minneapolis and Minnesota are calling for justice and healing, and care, state officials have been responding in some ways by basically preparing to go to war with folks \u2026 So, I do think it\u2019s meant to be an intimidation tactic.\u201d In arguably its most dystopian move, the city also wanted to pay social media influencers to share messages during the trial to prevent potential rioting. The city planned on giving six influencers $2,000 a day each to combat \u201cmisinformation\u201d. In January the city approved over a million dollars to fund a communication strategy that would include community organizations and influencers, specifically targeting \u201cBlack, Somali/East African, Native American, Hmong and Hispanic\u201d communities by sharing \u201ccity-generated and approved messages\u201d \u2013 which local activists have compared to the Ghetto Informant Program that Cointelpro used to hinder Black movements in the 1960s. After anger from community members, the influencer plan has been scrapped, though the city still plans on communicating with local leaders \u2013 excluding organizations like Black Visions who helped popularize the \u201cdefund the police\u201d demand. People in Minneapolis are preparing for the trial in their own ways. Some organizers have already planned protests, while others are rebuilding mutual aid networks to support each other with grocery runs and resources in case of unrest. The Corcoran Neighborhood Organization is encouraging text chains among neighbors and has initiated neighborhood patrols. Frey insists that these preparations are unnecessary, but there is a strong lack of faith in the city\u2019s ability to keep people safe, from police, and white supremacists, who have occasionally used moments of upheaval to attack protesters, like the 2015 shooting of five Minneapolis activists by white supremacists during protests over the police killing of Jamar Clark. The city\u2019s plans thus far seem to be more concerned about what have statistically been peaceful protests than with the very real threat of white supremacist violence. Instead of committing to police reform and transparency \u2013 or acknowledging the growing threat of the far right \u2013 the city of Minneapolis is, in the words of city councilman Jeremiah Ellison, \u201cshowing up ready for war\u201d.

While the Bessemer fulfillment center itself is a drop in the bucket when compared to Amazon\u2019s roughly 500 facilities around the country, this could be the ballot heard around the world. If successful, this election would mark the first unionized Amazon facility in the US.   Related: Amazon's mushrooming power has met an unlikely foe: Bessemer, Alabama | Hamilton Nolan    Over the past 26 years, Jeff Bezos has built himself a private empire. Amazon is now the second largest employer in the US, after Walmart, and the fifth largest in the world. The more than 800,000 Amazon employees across the country represent a population between the size of Maine and Montana. Globally, the company employs more than 1 million workers. Amazon is also the largest online retailer in the world, with a market cap (or value of the company\u2019s shares) at $1.5tn \u2013 larger than the GDPs of most countries. The power this company yields is unrivaled. Yet Amazon\u2019s success has been made possible by the labor of the underpaid and overworked employees who keep operations running; by weakened anti-trust laws; by a larger US economic shift from manufacturing to the service and logistics sectors; and, of course, by generous government subsidies, which have seen the company get away with paying no taxes in recent years. Unions alone will not bring Amazon to heel \u2013 but without them, all bets are off. The message this election will send to workers is: if we can do it in the anti-labor, \u201cright-to-work\u201d south against one of the most powerful companies in the world \u2013 one with no scruples with regards to its anti-union tactics \u2013 then workers can unionize anywhere. It would be a marked shift since Ronald Reagan\u2019s mass firing of striking air traffic control workers, which caused a chilling effect on organized labor and ushered in a new pro-business, anti-worker era. Labor organizers are hoping that a victory in Bessemer might turn this tide. The labor movement recognizes the significance of this election. Members of the AFL-CIO and nurses from a recently unionized hospital in North Carolina have been phone banking to speak with Bessemer workers directly about the importance of voting yes on a union. Supporters have also made it clear that the fight at the Bessemer facility, where about 85% of workers are Black, is also a fight for racial justice. Biden\u2019s recent statement in support of workers organizing in Alabama suggests that under this administration significant gains for labor can be won, but only if workers are willing to fight for them. One of the biggest lies sold to the American public has been to convince the vast majority of people that \u201cpolitics\u201d means showing up to the polls every few years to elect representative officials who will take it from there. Like many aspects of our lives, politics has become something to consume passively. It\u2019s cable news networks, the punditry class, bumper stickers, lawn signs, campaign donations. It\u2019s horse-race journalism and partisan tabloids.    A union victory for one workplace is a victory for all workers    It has narrowed the spectrum of the \u201cpolitical\u201d to red and blue, kids in cages or \u201cmigrant overflow facilities\u201d, dog whistles over bull horns, an open disdain for working people or a veneer of compassion. Far fewer see the actions they take day-to-day, in the workplaces where we spend the majority of our waking lives, as something worthy of being political. The Bessemer election has the potential to topple this frame in favor of a new horizon. The difference between electoral politics and labor organizing is the difference between voting in a president who says he will phase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next four years \u2013 yet surrenders before the battle begins \u2013 and taking direct action to ensure that higher wages are guaranteed in your contract immediately. Amazon prides itself on paying its workers $15 an hour \u2013 more than double the federal minimum wage \u2013 plus benefits. But rather than being a product of the benevolence of an enlightened CEO, we should all understand this to be a Machiavellian tactic used to preempt the serfs from storming the castle. More importantly, workers organizing towards a union must recognize that in the long run, without labor protections, every employee lives under the dictates of an unforgiving and despotic market. These \u201ctides\u201d will only turn when workers see themselves as a unified force and recognize that a union victory for one workplace is a victory for all workers. It favors a rising tide that will lift all boats to the trickle-down economics that have left us in perpetual drought. The Bessemer election is not one in which fulfillment center employees will cast their ballots and abdicate all further responsibilities. Rather, this vote would open the floodgates.

The central figure is \u201cDoc\u201d Florian Kaps, who the film presents as Vienna\u2019s answer to Steve Jobs, a social visionary untroubled by such details as earning a living or indeed running a functioning business. Kaps\u2019 speciality is what he calls \u201canalogue\u201d: physical hardware such as manual switchboards, jukeboxes, printing presses, and the like, made obsolete by the rise of laptops and smartphones. At the start of the film, Kaps\u2019 attention is caught by the failing Polaroid camera, and \u2013 seemingly on a whim \u2013 he agrees to take over the company\u2019s last factory, in the Netherlands. (We are not told much about his finances, other than the occasional arrival of tech investor types who pop up whenever needed.) It soon becomes clear that Kaps\u2019 visionary utterances (\u201cWhat does Facebook smell like?\u201d) are no match for a solid business plan, and after a few years of trying fruitlessly to replicate Polaroid\u2019s instant film, Kaps is ejected from his own company when a former intern becomes CEO after bringing in his own investor father.              Kaps is not daunted after this cautionary experience, and applies his roving mind to, first, a cafe/gallery called Supersense, and later to hotel keeping; his tech contacts come in handy for the latter as he appears to get backing from Facebook\u2019s Analog Research Lab to restart operations at a giant mothballed Overlook-type place called Sudbahnhotel. It\u2019s never clear exactly what roles Kaps has in any of these activities, or how he earns money, but he is genial company and makes a persuasive case for life beyond the digital realm: making an astute observation that, where once analogue businesses tried to convert to digital, digital companies are now getting interested in the real world. Of course, this was all filmed pre-Covid, during which the power of digital technology has asserted itself like never before.

In normal times, these massive cargo ships would have made their way from factories in China and other Asian nations directly to a dock at the ports of Los Angeles or Long Beach, the busiest seaport complex in the US. Today, they are spending an average of more than seven days sitting at anchor as dockworkers in southern California struggle to keep up with a surge in imports brought on by a pandemic-induced buying boom while parts of their workforce are recovering from the coronavirus. \u201cWe\u2019re happy to keep working because that is what we do, we\u2019re hard-working people,\u201d Henry Pollard Jr, a tophandler driver who has spent the past 15 years working at the ports. \u201cWe just need more skilled labor to help unload all the cargo.\u201d The backlog at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach \u2013 along with nearly every other port in the US \u2013 has been exacerbated by the spike in coronavirus cases in southern California tied to the holiday season. Of the 15,000 dockworkers at the two ports, about 800 have in recent weeks been infected with the coronavirus \u2013 a number representing just over 5% of the ports\u2019 total workforce. Overall, the workforce at both ports has seen almost 1,000 coronavirus infections and reported at least 12 deaths tied to the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re a full year into a global pandemic, and longshore workers have seen both record-breaking cargo imports and the heartbreaking deaths of our colleagues,\u201d Mike Podue, president of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, Local 63, said on the union\u2019s website. \u201cThese losses connect us all on an emotional, visceral level.\u201d Following a concerted push from both port officials and union leaders to have longshoremen and warehouse workers classified as a priority group to receive the Covid-19 vaccine, California authorities agreed and allowed workers at the ports to begin to be inoculated starting on 12 February.     Shipping containers sit on a dock in Oakland, California. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images    About 800 longshoremen were the first workers at the ports to receive shots of the Moderna vaccine at a clinic quickly organized by the Long Beach department of health and human services. Port officials said they were hopeful that with the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of the Johnson &amp; Johnson single-dose vaccine \u2013 along with the ramping up of production of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines \u2013 that the ports will be able to operate with a full workforce in the near future. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but it\u2019s on everybody\u2019s radar and we\u2019re simply trying to highlight the inventory as it becomes available,\u201d said Gene Seroka, the executive director of the port of Los Angeles. Seroka, however, cautioned that even having 100% of both longshoremen and dockworkers able to unload cargo would not solve the crisis caused by the surge of imports coming to US shores. \u201cWe have so much cargo that you need more than 100% to get the job done,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a dramatic turn from the first months of the pandemic, when the Chinese government issued its stay-at-home orders as Covid-19 began its global spread \u2013 a move that effectively shut down the manufacturing industry of the US\u2019s largest supplier of imported goods. In 2019, Chinese imports to the US totaled $451.7bn, accounting for over 18% of all goods imported to the US, according to the Office of the United States Trade Representative. In the spring of 2020, the volume plunged. \u201cIn the first five months of the year, through May, our cargo volume was down 19% and the available work on the docks was about the same percentage,\u201d Seroka said. \u201cSo truck drivers, the longshoremen, warehouse people \u2013 all those guys had less work opportunities.\u201d Pollard, too, said things got a \u201clittle rough\u201d during the first months of the pandemic. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a family and you\u2019ve got to take care of that family, so that was your major concern,\u201d Pollard said. He added, however, that many dockworkers at the time assumed the downturn would be similar to the annual slowdown around the Lunar New Year. And while it lasted longer than that, it quickly made a swift change of course last summer as Americans began dishing out dollars normally spent on dinner and movie tickets on consumer goods. Despite the high unemployment figures and overall economic insecurity, people were spending money on everything from sneakers and handbags to home goods and new cars.     Container ships are docked at the port of Oakland. Photograph: John G Mabanglo/EPA    A US commerce department report from last summer found that consumer spending jumped 6.5% in June 2020 and another 1.9%in July. And those numbers continue to remain high, with the commerce department reporting that consumer spending increased the largest amount in seven months in January amid new pandemic relief money to low-income households and a drop in the number of new Covid-19 infections. The spike has left the ports in a precarious situation, said Tony Nuzio, the founder and CEO of ICC Logistics Services, a New York-based transportation and logistics consulting firm. On one end, manufacturers in Asia are churning out products to meet the growing demand in the US and quickly shipping their goods across the Pacific. In many instances, shipping lines are making the return journey to Asian ports with empty containers \u2013 a move that speeds up their return to Asia but has angered American farmers, who say they are both losing out on overseas sales and being hit with rising costs. In January, the number of empty containers leaving the port of Los Angeles for Asia increased 14.5% compared to January 2020. Ports are also dealing with problems on the domestic front, namely a lack of space. With longshoremen in southern California being inundated with record amounts of new cargo on a daily basis, warehouse workers are also struggling to find room to store the deluge of containers. There is nary a warehouse within 60 miles of the two ports that is not filled to capacity and, at both the port and in warehouses, the time it takes for trucks to haul them away has more than doubled compared to before the pandemic. At the port of Los Angeles, for example, containers are currently sitting at the dock for an average of five days, compared with around two days before the surge. In off-site warehouses, those times climb higher, with containers sitting for around eight days instead of the standard three and a half days. \u201cMore thought really should have been put into how people in this country get their products,\u201d Nuzio said. \u201cWhen this is over, maybe it\u2019s time to pause and re-evaluate how we do things.\u201d While the surge, and resulting backlog at US docks, has resulted in sleepless nights for port workers and executives trying to figure out how to unload all the cargo, it has raised fears for the financial viability of companies and the looming threat of soaring prices for consumers on both sides of the Pacific. Businesses in Asia worry that they won\u2019t be able to secure the containers needed to ship their goods to the US, while their buyers stateside voice concerns that their shelves will remain empty. These scenarios are already playing out in US stores, where spot shortages of goods like household appliances and some clothing saw the cost of imported goods from China rise in December by 0.3%, the largest one-month gain in over three years. \u201cIt\u2019s the law of supply and demand,\u201d Nuzio said. \u201cOn the bright side, it looks like we\u2019re getting to a solution. Are we out of the woods yet? No, but we\u2019re getting there.\u201d Seroka and other port officials across the US have said that while the surge will continue well into the second quarter of 2021, the availability of more vaccines paired with putting pressure on the retail and import communities to pick up their shipments as quickly as possible will help ease the pressure. In the meantime, southern California ports are also selectively metering out ships to other nearby ports in an attempt to stem the backlog. \u201cIt does not do the American supply chain any good if we just keep stacking up ships,\u201d Seroka said. \u201cSo ships we can allow are going to other ports, but in very small, small percentages. He added: \u201cIt is allowing us some breadth and depth to catch up.\u201d Seroka estimated that southern California\u2019s ports will be able to clear up the backlog sometime my mid-summer, but warned that if the pileup of cargo is not resolved, there could be dire consequences when consumer spending ramps up even more for next winter\u2019s holiday season. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be prepared for that because if we don\u2019t get out of this and then the cargo takes another uptick, that\u2019s going to spell a lot more complications than even this equation we\u2019ve got going right now,\u201d he said.", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Fishermen's wives: how unsung efforts keep a way of life afloat", "full_article": "In spring 2020, the fishing community of Newport, Oregon, shuttered along with the rest of the country. A coronavirus outbreak at a local Pacific Seafood processing plant left fishermen sitting on docks with no buyers for their Dungeness crabs, while restaurants closed and families found themselves housebound. That\u2019s when Taunette Dixon and her organization, the Newport Fishermen\u2019s Wives, stepped in. This group quickly mobilized to provide food, supplies, infant formula, pet food, fuel cards, masks, gloves and money for past-due utility payments to fishing families who had been hit by the pandemic. For 50 years, groups like Dixon\u2019s have formed the behind-the-scenes backbone of their communities, often lobbying on behalf of their husbands, who leave for months at a time to fish. In fishing towns where fishermen\u2019s spouses stay onshore, fishermen\u2019s wives associations have served as mutual aid groups, social support networks and political agitators. Dixon and her colleagues mend nets, keep books, care for families, fight for or against environmental regulations, navigate byzantine quota systems and act as onshore brokers communicating information to husbands out at sea. Data about these women is scarce, and there\u2019s not much research quantifying exactly how much work they perform for the industry, but social scientists call their labor an \u201cinformal subsidy\u201d. And yet, when policymakers talk about supporting fishermen, women like Dixon are often left out of the conversation. And at a local level, members of these groups say their individual efforts can go unnoticed or taken for granted.

Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian    \u201cIn a fishing family like mine, I do the management. I do payroll, I make sure we have our permits, I fill out all the red tape,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s recognized generally how much work women do in the industry. It\u2019s changing but it has a long way to go.\u201d Some of these women receive payment for their administrative and organizing work by finding jobs at fishing-related non-profits or governmental agencies, while others don\u2019t, and most are well-respected in their communities. But many say their organizations are still rankled by broader misconceptions about women in fishing and by casual misogyny. \u201cIf somebody calls about some aspect of what\u2019s going on on the boat, they\u2019re always asking for my husband when it\u2019s myself who\u2019s going to give the answer,\u201d said Dixon, who is co-president of the Newport group.\u201d [People need to] realize that women can make good decisions in the fishing industry.\u201d ***   Related: 'We have no market, but lots of lobsters': a Maine lobsterwoman fights for her livelihood    Fishing has always been a harsh, addictive pursuit, and the fishing industry has always been singular: it involves making a profit off creatures that dwell in a public resource, and as such, it\u2019s often both highly regulated and contentious \u2013 just this season, fishermen in Newport joined their counterparts up and down the west coast to strike in protest of low prices for Dungeness crab. These days, the industry finds itself at a crossroads: battling climate change, which has altered currents, expelled species from their traditional breeding grounds and acidified the ocean, and Covid-19, which caused the lucrative export market for fish to collapse last spring. While women do fish, especially in Alaska and on the west coast, there are plenty of reasons why women who marry fishermen or are born into fishing families may stay onshore. In some industries, such as lobstering, the exclusive licensing system favors the old boys\u2019 club. In Massachusetts, the Italian and Portuguese immigrants who shaped the industry believed that women on boats brought bad luck. \u201cTraditionally we\u2019re in a man\u2019s world,\u201d said Ren\u00e9e Gagne, who once worked as a commercial fisherman, and now works as a shellfish constable in Massachusetts, a town-appointed job that entails monitoring clam diggers to ensure they\u2019re sticking to regulations. \u201cThere\u2019s limited participation of women in the actual fishing part of it.\u201d     Heather Mann, the executive director of the Midwater Trawlers Cooperative talks with boat owners in Newport, Oregon, on 8 January. Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian    And yet when a woman marries a fisherman, his career often transforms her life. \u201cBecoming a fisherman\u2019s wife is almost like marrying into the military, without the kudos,\u201d said Suzanne Russell, a social scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) in Seattle. Fishing becomes the organizing principle of their family life. Women who are born or marry into this world might support the family business by handling day-to-day tasks. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of grinding and scraping and painting of boats,\u201d Amber Taunton, Dixon\u2019s co-president, said one November afternoon, after just coming in from painting buoys. Others might take a governmental role like Gagne, work in a non-profit, design nets or run markets. But one of the most enduring ways in which women have supported the industry is through the fishermen\u2019s wives groups. These organizations sometimes pop up to tackle a particular industry issue and then dissolve, but others remain in operation, gaining sway in their local community and becoming a force to be reckoned with. The Newport group, for example, started as a social club but transformed into a support and advocacy group for the local fishing economy. One example of their organizing was in 2014, when they successfully sued the Coast Guard over a plan to remove its search and rescue helicopter base from Newport, which the wives feared would imperil their seafaring husbands.

Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian    In Massachusetts, in another tight-knit fishing community, the Gloucester Fishermen\u2019s Wives Association has taken on a political edge, shaping New England fishing since it was founded in 1969. The group\u2019s current president, Angela Sanfilippo, emigrated from Sicily to Gloucester when she was young, and by 1977, she was married to a fisherman, with two children. That year saw the enactment by the UN of the 200-mile limit, which established an exclusive economic zone for US fishermen. The downside was that they started catching too much, flooding the market. Sanfilippo attended a meeting about this issue to translate for the fishermen, first-generation Italian immigrants, many of whom didn\u2019t speak English, and found herself weighing in. Since then, she and her fellow wives have asserted themselves as key decision-makers in the local fishing economy. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they first secured a one-year and then a 10-year moratorium on disruptive oil drilling on Georges Bank, fertile fishing grounds off the east coast. In 1993, they negotiated with environmental groups to preserve fishing rights in the Stellwagen marine sanctuary, crucial territory for Massachusetts fishermen. In 2008, they pioneered one of the nation\u2019s first community-supported fishery boxes, Cape Ann Fresh Catch, to encourage consumers to eat different kinds of seafood. They opposed wind turbines on fishing grounds, facilitated safety training, erected a fishermen\u2019s wives statue in their town. \u201cWe were shore captains,\u201d said Sanfilippo. \u201cWe would make sure when the boats came in, they\u2019d get everything they needed so they could go back out the next morning at 2.30. The wife would be responsible to make sure these things happened. As their wives, we knew more than them.\u201d ***     Fishing vessels sit in port in Newport, Oregon. Photograph: Amanda Lucier/The Guardian    Overlooking women\u2019s work has a long history, said sociologist Erin Hatton, who studies gender and labor at the University at Buffalo. She calls this the gender lens: work done by women is coded and perceived as unessential, not as real labor. One famous historical example, said Hatton, stems from the garment industry: women were considered to have nimble fingers, and so their aptitude with sewing was considered natural and biological, not skilled work that should be fairly compensated. Discourse around women\u2019s so-called natural affinity for parenting and nurturing also falls into this category, said Hatton. Because the wives\u2019 work focuses as much on individuals\u2019 needs in their community as it does on the broader conditions of the fishing industry, their contributions to the local economy can similarly go overlooked. And yet it\u2019s hard to describe the women\u2019s work as anything other than essential. It seems women are the connective tissue of fishing communities: bringing together other workers with hard-to-access resources. If a fisherman needs a new trailer truck for his business and can\u2019t afford it, he might come to them for help, said Nina Groppo, a colleague of Sanfilippo\u2019s. When the pandemic hit, Sanfilippo said the wives helped families apply for unemployment and SBA loans and helped fishermen track down tariff relief funds that were owed to them, while their healthcare navigators helped fishermen parse the MassHealth system. Despite all this, fishermen\u2019s wives groups are often left out of discussions at a policy level, especially at the state and federal level. \u201cIf we\u2019re designing support for fishermen to help them through Covid, do we need to think in broader terms about who\u2019s affected [in these economies] beyond just the fishermen themselves?\u201d said Sarah Harper, a professor at the University of Victoria who studies the social dimensions of fishing communities. Policies like tariff relief payments, industry-specific Covid relief and compensatory programs for regions affected by oil spills may assist fishermen who find themselves struggling \u2013 but if women back home are organizing among themselves to help prop up the industry, who is looking out for them? \u201cThe implications of that oversight are quite significant. We have to consider all the people involved,\u201d said Harper. Asked what can be done to garner more recognition for fishermen\u2019s wives, Hatton said she thinks these women are already on the right track. The fishermen\u2019s wives groups, she said, \u201care taking up space and asserting that they deserve recognition for their work. It sounds like they\u2019re doing part of that work of taking off the gendered lens that obscures our vision about what work is, and who does it.\u201d As Nina Groppo said, \u201cNow fishermen\u2019s wives are almost an icon.\u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Queen and David Bowie recorded Cream covers in Under Pressure sessions", "full_article": "A new interview with Brian May and Roger Taylor reveals there are further unreleased recordings made by David Bowie and Queen during the sessions that produced Under Pressure.

The breach, news of which first emerged in late February, allowed hackers to extract Gab databases that appear to show user accounts and a history of public posts and direct messages. The user lists appear to mark 500 accounts, including neo-Nazis, QAnon influencers, cryptocurrency advocates and conspiracy theorists, as investors. They also appear to give an overview of verified users of the platform, including prominent rightwing commentators and activists. And they mark hundreds of active users on the site as \u201cautomated\u201d, appearing to indicate administrators knew the accounts were bots but let them continue on the platform regardless. Finally, the data appears to contain direct messages between the Gab CEO, Andrew Torba, and a user who has been identified as a high-profile QAnon influencer, showing the entrepreneur seeking direct feedback on site design from a member of a group that promotes a \u201cspiderweb of rightwing internet conspiracy theories with antisemitic and anti-LGBTQ elements\u201d, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.

In messages sent from the pirated accounts, the hackers claimed they had obtained 831 \u201cverification documents\u201d from the site and asked for Bitcoins in exchange for returning them. High-profile users spew hate Gab, a Twitter-like website promoted by Torba as a bastion of free speech, has long been a forum of last resort for extremists and conspiracy theorists who have been banned on other online platforms. It attained worldwide notoriety in 2018 when a user, Robert Bowers, wrote on the site that he was \u201cgoing in\u201d, shortly before allegedly entering the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and killing 11 people.     People hug on the sidewalk outside the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on 27 October, the second anniversary of the shooting. Photograph: Gene J Puskar/AP    News of the initial breach was first reported by Wired magazine on 28 February, after reports about it had been circulating online. The data was not publicly released, but was offered selectively to reporters and activists by the transparency organization Distributed Denial of Secrets. Torba acknowledged the vulnerability and the breach in a statement released following the leak but did not comment on the authenticity of the data or particular content. He did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment on its content. The leaked files contained what appears to be a database of over 4.1 million registered users on the site and tags identifying subscribers as \u201cinvestors\u201d, \u201cverified\u201d users and \u201cpro\u201d users. Gab investors contributed in one of three share offerings and one convertible note, a form of short-term debt that converts into equity, according to its financial reporting. The 2017 share offering, for example, required a minimum investment of $199.10, and rewarded investors who contributed a greater amount with \u201cperks\u201d. Users who invested $200 could display a \u201cGab investor badge\u201d on the site. The badges corresponded with a tag in the database, which allowed investors to be looked at in detail. Some of the people associated with investors\u2019 accounts had high-profile jobs and public roles, while spewing hate and extremist beliefs online. Among the accounts labeled as an investor is a user named \u201cManwe Sulimo\u201d, who presents themselves in their user bio as a \u201cformer NASA Engineer turned Flat-earther\u201d. The account is littered with posts and reposts of antisemitic, transphobic and pro-Nazi material. At one point the user expressed the opinion that \u201cJews are Satan\u2019s chosen people\u201d. In their profile, they link to several videos, including a notorious pro-Hitler documentary series.

While there is no evidence that Moore worked directly with Nasa, papers he co-authored confirm the claims made on his LinkedIn profile that he worked on aspects of NanoFet, an experimental high-speed spacecraft engine, while an engineering student at the University of Michigan. His LinkedIn profile also says that he is currently a thermal simulation engineer at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Neither Moore nor Fiat Chrysler returned requests for comment. BiglySpeaks is another account tagged as belonging to an investor. The bio for the account carries hashtags indicating a promotion of Holocaust and coronavirus denial, apparent beliefs that are also reflected in the account\u2019s antisemitic and conspiracy-minded posts. The email address attached to the account belongs to Steven Reid, a former Republican party activist and conservative political blogger in Provo, Utah. In 2011, Reid unsuccessfully ran for secretary of the Utah county Republican party. His now dormant blog, Nacilbupera, was widely cited as a source of information on conservative politics in that state. Reid did not respond to a request for comment. \u2018Pro\u2019 users, verified users and bots The data breach also appears to offer some insight into users tagged as \u201cverified\u201d by Gab, which according to the platform\u2019s own explanation means that they have completed a verification process that includes matching their display name to a government ID. Verified users whose email addresses appear to have been exposed in the leak range from longtime political operatives, such as Roger Stone, to far-right political commentators including Michelle Malkin and Peter Brimelow, editor of VDare, and far-right activists such as Nick Fuentes and Jared Taylor, who heads the white nationalist organization American Renaissance. And it appears to include a list of users registered as \u201cpros\u201d, which allows users to access additional features and a badge at a price starting at $99 year. The database indicates over 18,000 users had paid to be pro users at the time of the breach. Nearly 4,000 users were flagged as donors to Gab\u2019s repeated attempts to attract voluntary gifts from users. More than 770 registered accounts on the platform, including some active ones, appear to be marked in the service\u2019s own database as bots. The Guardian emailed all of the verified users named above for comment on the breach, but none immediately responded except for Jared Taylor, who wrote in an email: \u201cThis hacking operation was a federal crime, but don\u2019t expect the Biden administration to care.\u201d Direct messages included in the leak appear to show close communication between Torba and a major QAnon influencer who is labeled a Gab investor, seemingly reinforcing the CEO\u2019s public efforts to make Gab a home for adherents to the QAnon conspiracy theory, which helped fuel the 6 January attack on the nation\u2019s Capitol.     Torba publicly sought to make Gab a home for believers in the QAnon movement, which helped fuel the Capitol attack. Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters    In the messages, Torba and the user Neon Revolt, who has been identified as Richard Cornero Jr, a QAnon influencer, discuss the direct messaging feature, then relatively new on the platform. The messages suggest a close relationship between Gab\u2019s CEO and one of the key proponents of a baseless conspiracy theory whose adherents have held, among other things, that Donald Trump was on a secret mission to expose and imprison members of a pedophile ring that included celebrities and high-ranking Democratic politicians. Cornero did not respond to a request for comment. \u2018Negligent or malicious\u2019 about security According to Wired, the data exposed in the apparent hack was sourced by a hacker who had found a security vulnerability in the site. Eugen Rochko, the developer of a source codebase named Mastodon that was used by Gab as a basis for its website from early 2019 over Rochko\u2019s objections, believes poor security practices played a significant part in the breach. Rochko said in an email that Gab adopted Mastodon\u2019s codebase \u201cas a way of circumventing Google\u2019s and Apple\u2019s ban on [Gab\u2019s smartphone app] from their app stores\u201d, but that Gab then removed features that show total numbers of users and active users, and ultimately severed ties with Mastodon\u2019s ongoing development process.. In doing this, Gab\u2019s programmers introduced two serious security vulnerabilities into its code, according to Rochko, one of which was publicized by another programmer in early February. Rochko says that Gab did little to address these \u201cobvious\u201d problems, adding: \u201cI\u2019m not aware of them ever adopting our bug fixes, including important security fixes.\u201d   Related: US militia group draws members from military and police, website leak shows    Megan Squire, a professor of computer science at Elon University and longtime researcher on the far right\u2019s use of internet technologies said the vulnerabilities Gab introduced in its codebase were \u201cbasic, basic stuff\u201d. \u201cGab was negligent at best and malicious at worst\u201d in its approach to security, she added. \u201cIt is hard to envision a scenario where a company cared less about user data than this one.\u201d Of this week\u2019s hack, Torba said in a post on the site that the hacker had taken advantage of Gab\u2019s failure to clear user authorization tokens following the initial attack, but that Gab had \u201cnot independently verified the information that the hacker posted\u201d. Squire added that her comments \u201cstill apply\u201d after this latest breach. Gab\u2019s chief technology officer, Fosco Marotto, did not respond directly to questions about Gab\u2019s approach to security, writing in an email of the hack: \u201cOur investigation is continuing and we will have more to say on this matter when it has concluded.\u201d Torba himself initiated communication with the Guardian after it had started contacting users identified in the data breach. Torba sent an empty email with the subject line, \u201cDeuteronomy 28:7\u201d, a Bible verse promising victory over enemies. He did not respond to a return email with questions about his security practices but used his own website to condemn \u201cjournos\u201d and other perceived enemies.

Not only does Jesson\u2019s commute create a buffer between her work and personal time, but it \u201cadds that more human aspect\u201d back into her day.    When you\u2019re commuting, there\u2019s hundreds of people around you, so it\u2019s kind of like everyone\u2019s in it together  Kerri Jesson     \u201cWhen you\u2019re commuting, there\u2019s hundreds of people around you, so it\u2019s kind of like everyone\u2019s in it together,\u201d she says. Jesson is clearly not the only one craving this sort of downtime. Microsoft has tried to recreate the benefits lost from commuting by creating a \u201cvirtual commute\u201d, giving employees time to set goals in the morning, and reflect back on the workday at its end \u2013 with an optional short guided meditation to round everything off. John Dorsey, an attorney in Washington DC, had been cycling 40-odd minutes to work and back every day for 20 years when the pandemic hit. For him, cycling was a way to avoid heinous city traffic while exercising, or to listen to the occasional HG Wells audiobook. Dorsey\u2019s last day working in an office was a Friday, and the following Monday he was already back out there on his \u201ccircular commute\u201d, a 15-mile morning ride through Rock Creek Park that\u2019s become a favorite pastime. \u201cIt\u2019s an hour where I don\u2019t really need to talk to anybody, I\u2019m just sort of away,\u201d he says. But with winter\u2019s freezing temperatures, you would think some cyclists might appreciate a break from their morning commute. Apparently not, for cyclist Louis Philippe, a business analyst in Mississauga, Ontario, who has continued cycling to work through winter, but from the comfort of his own home. Philippe appreciates the meditative qualities of a morning \u201cfake commute\u201d cycle \u2013 but  swapped out the rush of wind in his hair and got his adrenaline pumping from November onwards using a stationary bike in his basement. \u201cAs soon as it starts getting dark early and we change the clocks I have trouble getting up to [bike outside] early in the morning,\u201d he explains. Studies support the fact that commutes offer the benefit of creating psychologically useful transition periods between work and home life. Consciously signaling to the brain and body it\u2019s time to stop working is especially important when we\u2019re working from home: a recent study of 3.1 million people by the National Bureau of Economic Research determined that following lockdown orders, remote workers stayed on the job almost 50 minutes longer every day than they did while in office, a trend which could exacerbate burnout. Before the pandemic, when commuting was obligatory, its healthy, boundary-creating elements may have felt like a meager silver lining around a dark cloud of drudgery and stress to many. Now, faux commuters can journey on their own terms, choosing where to go \u2013 like a park instead of gridlocked traffic; they can choose their mode of transportation \u2013 like a nice walk rather than a dark subway ride; and how long they want to \u201ccommute\u201d for \u2013 perhaps just in the morning, afternoon, or both.    [The faux commute] is super vital for optimizing sleep quality and the capacity to fall asleep easily at night  Jessica Eastman     Jessica Eastman, a naturopathic doctor and a faux commuter herself, even believes a commute can be the secret to a high-quality sleep \u2013 something many have found harder to get during the pandemic. Now, Eastman prescribes morning and after-work walks to her clients to help them clear their minds and get better rest. \u201cPeople are having a really hard time falling asleep at the end of the day after working remotely,\u201d she says, explaining how time blurs together without clear slots for things like lunch, start time and finish time. Without the time to process and clear information, she says we end up finally doing it at the end of the day, when we lie down to sleep \u2013 keeping us up at night. \u201cNot only is [the faux commute] really vital for helping to regulate mood, energy and focus for the day, it\u2019s also super vital for optimizing sleep quality and the capacity to fall asleep with ease in the evening.\u201d At the very least, faux commuting is as good a reason as any to get out of the house.

The 24 activists \u2013 including 13 in exile \u2013 have written to the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, to call for the EU to refuse to sign the treaty until China\u2019s national security laws are repealed and restrictions on who can stand for election are lifted. The letter comes as the EU prepares to try to sell its deal reached at the end of last year in the face of intense scepticism inside the European parliament. MEPs must ratify the deal before it can come into force. That task will not be made any easier by China\u2019s National People\u2019s Congress voting unanimously bar one abstention overnight to back changes to Hong Kong electoral laws to ensure only patriots can stand. The US has expressed its regret at the EU decision, and the Hong Kong exiles claim the EU is both being naive in trusting China\u2019s commitments on labour rights and letting down those prepared to fight against authoritarianism by backing the deal. The activists write: \u201cGiven that Beijing is in the process of rewriting Hong Kong\u2019s electoral system in direct contravention to its international obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, is currently undertaking mass arrests and trials of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists under the draconian National Security Law, and is infringing on basic freedoms guaranteed both under the Basic Law and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, we do not see how the EU can move ahead with ratification of this investment treaty.\u201d The letter, facilitated by Hong Kong Watch, is co-signed by leading activists including Ted Hui, Lam Wing-kee, Brian Leung, Nathan Law, Joe Tay, Ray Wong, Glacier Kwong, Finn Lau, Simon Cheng and Joey Siu. It adds: \u201cIt is simply absurd for the EU to expect China to uphold its obligations under a new bilateral investment treaty, when it is openly floating its current obligations to the international community to guarantee the autonomy and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong.\u201d The letter is likely to be powerful ammunition for the large group of MEPs who are determined to resist the investment treaty. They warn that if European leaders show no moral backbone and instead sign the treaty they will be sending a signal to China that there are no red lines, including over the future of Taiwan.

It sent a message to Beijing that the EU would not sacrifice trading interests, no matter how they act, and communicated to Hongkongers that the EU is indifferent to our struggle to freedom.\u201d Ray Wong, the first refugee from Hong Kong to receive asylum in Germany, said: \u201cIn Hong Kong, we have experienced first-hand that the CCP is not willing to keep its word. While the Australians are being punished with tariffs for taking a stand for democracy, the EU is ploughing ahead with CAI. The deal will weaken the bloc\u2019s ability to take a principled stand in solidarity with Hong Kong\u2019s people, and Uighurs facing oppression.\u201d Many MEPs say the EU is in a totally compromised position since it is advocating closer economic ties with China at the same time as it is issuing statements condemning the changes to electoral law and vowing to be ready to take additional steps. The commission says the deal, years in the making, improves market access for EU companies, protects intellectual property and provides levers to make demands on human rights.

Melbourne: flights to the Gold Coast, Cairns, Maroochydore, Alice Springs, Uluru, Launceston, Devonport, Burnie, Broome and Merimbula. Adelaide: flights to the Gold Coast, Maroochydore, Alice Springs and Kangaroo Island. Brisbane: flights to Alice Springs, Uluru and Launceston. Darwin: flights to Cairns and Broome. Perth: flights to Alice Springs. Avalon: flights to the Gold Coast. Which airlines\u2019 flights will be half price? Qantas and Jetstar expect to provide the bulk of the cheaper flights, with plans to offer 32,000 of the half-price fares per week. Virgin Australia has also welcomed the initiative and will provide a smaller amount.   Related: Domestic bliss: Australian destinations that feel like an overseas holiday    Regional airlines, including Rex, will be eligible for the routes, so long as they have been operating the route for the past two years. How do we know the airlines won\u2019t increase their flight costs now? The amount of subsidy the government pays for airlines to halve their airfares will be based on the average fares charged in February. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, said he had held \u201clong discussions\u201d with Qantas and Virgin and had received assurances they would not artificially raise their prices before the discount offers came into effect. However the government has not announced a mechanism to monitor and enforce this. Can I book through a travel agent? While the details of the package are yet to be finalised, Graham Turner, Flight Centre founder and chief executive, told the Guardian that airlines had indicated to him that they intended to distribute the flights among travel agents, and would not require bookings to be made directly on their websites. How do I know states won\u2019t suddenly close their borders again if there\u2019s a Covid outbreak? There\u2019s no guarantee states will remain open to interstate travellers if there is an outbreak of Covid-19, as much as the federal government would like states to reassure travellers. The federal tourism minister, Dan Tehan, told 6PR radio the threat of snap border closures was the biggest obstacle for potential travellers. \u201cOne of the things we\u2019re really looking for \u2026 is a firm message from state and territory leaders that border closures will now be used as a last resort.\u201d But when the Queensland treasurer, Cameron Dick, was asked about it on ABC radio on Thursday morning, he reiterated that his state would \u201cact on the health advice\u201d. On the plus side, airlines now have a well-established process for issuing vouchers or refunds for flights cancelled due to coronavirus-related disruptions. What\u2019s the point of all these cheap flights?  Responding to tourism sector calls for ongoing support after jobkeeper payments end, the government hopes the package will encourage Australians to travel to tourist destinations that have previously relied on international tourism.   Related: Going anywhere: Australian mystery holidays are back from the 1990s    However many in the sector are sceptical this package can fill the void the ongoing international border closure has created, and that jobs that had relied on jobkeeper will be lost once the subsidy ends. There are also concerns the package, which also includes loan initiatives separate to the flight discounts, mostly help the aviation sector while hotels and tourism businesses in capital cities benefit less. Labor has also questioned why the majority of the initial 13 destinations that benefit from the package are located in marginal seats while neighbouring areas miss out. The Queensland state government has criticised the package\u2019s lack of incentive for travel within states. What about the increased emissions? Richie Merzian, the climate and energy program director at the Australia Institute, warns that while the policy will benefit airlines it will also have \u201ca noticeable impact\u201d on Australia\u2019s climate emissions. Merzian said domestic aviation accounted for a significant portion of the country\u2019s transport emissions in a normal year. While there was a significant fall during the pandemic, overall transport emissions had already rebounded, thanks in large part to increased road travel. Offering the subsidy to airlines could \u201cpotentially tip it further in the opposite direction\u201d, Merzian said. \u201cThe impact of this will be substantial and we will be able to see the impact of these flights in terms of the national emissions. This is basically an aviation fuel recovery package.\u201d He was critical of the government for not attaching emissions reduction conditions to the package as some European countries had done when airlines were given bailouts. \u201cAs part of the deal they could have made Qantas and Virgin agree to offset the flights which would have created demand for offset projects and stimulated regional economies,\u201d Merzian said.

James, who rode Gordon Elliott\u2019s Native Milan to win the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase at the Cheltenham Festival last year, has also agreed not to attend any race or point-to-point meeting during the four months in which his licence is suspended.   Related: Talking Horses: Denise Foster takes reins as Galvin leaves Elliott yard    The video of James, briefly sitting on a horse that had suffered a heart attack on a gallop in 2016, emerged three days after a similar image of Elliott started to circulate on social media last week. James subsequently apologised for his actions, saying he was \u201cheartbroken by the damage\u201d which the video had caused. The detailed decision of the panel, read out by Ms Justice Leonie Reynolds at the end of the case, will be published on Thursday. Earlier, the IHRB said Elliott\u2019s agreement not to attend a racecourse for six months is the only condition attached either to the trainer\u2019s penalty, which was imposed last week, or to the licence of Denise Foster, who took charge of his Cullentra House stable in County Meath on Tuesday when Elliott started his six-month suspension. The news from Ireland will increase pressure on the British Horseracing Authority to address concerns that Elliott could retain a significant role in the training operation, and do so before the Cheltenham Festival next week when Foster will have a strong team of horses in action. \u201cAs per rule 148(i),\u201d Niall Cronin, the IRHB\u2019s communications manager, said on Wednesday, \u201cthe licensed trainer of a horse shall be responsible for everything connected with the welfare, training and running of all horses under their care and shall be liable to any sanction available \u2026 unless the trainer provides a satisfactory explanation. \u201cIn addition to this, it was noted by Justice Groarke [the chair of Elliott\u2019s disciplinary panel] on Friday that Gordon Elliott will not attend any race meeting or point-to-point for six months. There are no further conditions on the suspension of Mr Elliott or the licence of Mrs Foster. We have nothing further to add on this matter.\u201d The absence of any additional conditions on Foster\u2019s licence suggests Elliott, who lives at a yard which houses around 300 horses and employs about 50 staff, could retain a close role in the day-to-day operation of the yard. That, in turn, will turn the focus back to the BHA, whose chief executive, Julie Harrington, said earlier on Wednesday that the authority was \u201ccurrently seeking clarification of what conditions have been put in place\u201d.   Related: Damage of Gordon Elliott's 'moment of madness' will take years to erase    Asked to expand on the BHA\u2019s approach to the issue, Harrington said: \u201cI\u2019m asking for those conditions but also making it clear what our views are, on behalf of JCR [Jockey Club Racecourses, which owns Cheltenham] as well, because we want to make sure that any horses that are attending are clearly not under the Gordon Elliott flag. \u201cI\u2019ve made our views on it clear, I\u2019m waiting to hear what conditions will be applied to Denise and we\u2019ll also be able to look at, if we\u2019re not happy, what\u2019s available to us within our own rules.\u201d Asked whether possible action could include preventing Foster\u2019s horses from running at Cheltenham, Harrington said: \u201cI think at this point we\u2019re having really good discussions with the IHRB so I\u2019m not envisaging us getting to that point.\u201d Thursday\u2019s racing preview and tips Carlisle\u2019s seven-race card sailed through its precautionary inspection at 7am on Thursday, and soft-to-heavy ground at what is already one of the most demanding tracks in the country will hold no fears for Evita Du Mesnil (1.00), a winner over course-and-distance, and in a strong time, under similar conditions last month. But the Tapeta at Newcastle could be a more reliable proposition for punters, and while the fillies\u2019 handicap at Gosforth Park is short on numbers, it is still a competitive heat in which the highly-progressive Arafi (7.00) can be backed at around 15-8.

But in Miami, at least, it is going to be impossible to forget. Artifacts and memories of the deadliest global pandemic in a century are on display at what is probably the nation\u2019s first comprehensive coronavirus museum exhibition, forming an enduring testament to an unprecedented era.   Related: Vaccine vials and a virtual hug: a history of coronavirus in 15 objects    Highlights of the collection at the downtown HistoryMiami museum include personal protective equipment (PPE) worn by doctors who treated Covid-19 patients at a local hospital; an emergency beach closure order sign from Miami Beach; a sign from a closed, open, then closed again restaurant; a high school student\u2019s mortarboard from her drive-through graduation ceremony; and a younger student\u2019s school workbook from online learning. There are colorful handmade posters from drive-by birthday celebrations and first responder appreciation parades; vials of two of the first Pfizer vaccines administered at Jackson Memorial hospital; and a jar of hand sanitizer produced by Toast, a vodka company that switched operations at its Miami distillery early in the pandemic.

It\u2019s a symbol of trying to get the public\u2019s attention in a powerful way to get leaders to do the right thing.\u201d     \u2018I hope people look at it and see what our elected officials and other people were doing wrong, and ignoring and lying and politicizing and scapegoating,\u2019 said Daniel Uhlfelder. Photograph: Douglas Lance/Courtesy of HistoryMiami    Jorge Zamanillo, HistoryMiami\u2019s executive director and curator, said his team realized early in the pandemic that it was living history, and set about chronicling events as part of the museum\u2019s Collecting 2020 initiative, which incorporates memorabilia from the Black Lives Matter protests of last summer, and November\u2019s divisive elections. Other artifacts include a BLM jersey worn by Miami Heat basketball star Bam Adebayo, a prominent supporter of the racial justice movement; protest signs from BLM rallies that took place in Miami; and election materials, including some from the campaign of Danielle Levine Cara, Miami-Dade county\u2019s first female mayor. \u201cIt was the year that really transformed the nation, the world and locally \u2026 we all pivoted and changed the way we live,\u201d Zamanillo said. \u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of this historic moment and what we are recording is a historical narrative that we are going to keep going back to and reading about.\u201d Zamanillo said he recognized that people were keen to put the pandemic behind them, but it was important to archive their stories, even as they were still being affected by them. The museum has encouraged the public to send in their written or recorded memories. \u201cYou start to realize how personal it is, the impact emotionally on their family. Did they lose a loved one, did they contract Covid, or how did it affect their lives? Did they lose their jobs, or their business? Are they frontline workers? \u201cWhen we look back in five, 10, 15 years, we\u2019re going to have not just the artifacts, but the stories of how we hopefully learned as a community, how we survived this, how we transformed ourselves and how we improved.\u201d The concept of chronicling the pandemic is not unique to Miami. Similar initiatives are under way in several other cities across the US and Canada, according to the Wall Street Journal. The Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington DC, for example, plans to exhibit a 3D-model of the virus created by Dr Anthony Fauci, the country\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert. The museum already has a diverse Stories of 2020 collection online. In Miami, Zamanillo noted, the public can already visit the physical exhibition, albeit in restricted numbers due to Covid protocols. He said the collection was intended to be a comprehensive educational tool for future visitors, both locals and tourists, who would ask specific questions: \u201cWhat made this special for you? How do you remember this moment? What are the stories and artifacts that relate to these things that help you remember this unforgettable year?\u201d he said. \u201cAs painful as things may be right now, if we\u2019re not the gatekeepers, the ones that make the effort to preserve these memories, no one else will.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "NHL magic, north London derby memories and very long drives | Classic YouTube", "full_article": "1) It\u2019s the north London derby this weekend and no one has a clue which Arsenal or Tottenham will turn up at the Emirates.

Within 48 hours of Meghan and Prince Harry turning a much-needed spotlight on racism in the industry, Morgan\u2019s sudden departure from ITV\u2019s breakfast show shifted the attention not just to him, but to the issue of free speech. His comments tested the tension between freedom of expression and truth, just as two news channels are to be launched that could test the boundaries of the UK\u2019s regulated, impartial TV media. This is not about whether Morgan will end up working for Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK streaming service or Andrew Neil\u2019s GB News (though the prospect of jobs at the channels undoubtedly eased his passage from ITV), but about whether it can possibly be right to publicly disown the truth of somebody else\u2019s mental distress. The pretty obvious answer is that it cannot \u2013 and yet Morgan\u2019s departure has still somehow managed to stir up a row over what impartiality means in broadcast news. It may be tempting to ignore this, but a failure to reassert the principles of impartiality will make it easier for broadcasters to succumb to the economic and political pressures pushing them towards the sort of partisan TV media that is common in the US.   Related: Is Britain's TV news at risk of being dominated by those who shout loudest?    But first, a recap for those struggling with the frenzied news cycle of the past few days. The morning after Meghan told Oprah Winfrey that she had contemplated suicide and received no help from the royal family, Morgan called her a liar. \u201cI don\u2019t believe a word she says, Meghan Markle. I wouldn\u2019t believe her if she read me a weather report.\u201d The charity Mind, which supports an ITV mental health campaign, joined many others, including his own colleagues, in accusing him of being irresponsible and harmful. Meanwhile, 41,000 people complained to media regulator Ofcom. When a mealy-mouthed comment about not disputing the real issues of mental health failed to stop his own colleagues criticising him on air, Morgan stomped off. In a departure note posted to Twitter on Wednesday morning, Morgan wrote: \u201cI said I didn\u2019t believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I\u2019ve had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don\u2019t. If you did, OK. Freedom of speech is a hill I\u2019m happy to die on.\u201d Inevitably, he posted a picture of Churchill with the old saw: \u201cSome people\u2019s idea of free speech is that they are free to say what they like, but if anyone says anything back, that is an outrage.\u201d Some of Morgan\u2019s old colleagues at CNN rallied to his defence. Anchor Jake Tapper called the reaction \u201cinsanity\u201d and tweeted: \u201cThis is what happens when you live in a country where there is no First amendment.\u201d Tapper suggested that it would be better for complainants to \u201ctweet Piers what you think of his comments\u201d rather than go to the regulator, part of whose job it is to prevent public service broadcasters causing harm and offence. Tapper is a brilliant presenter (as is Morgan in many ways), but his idea that Twitter is the place for redress underlines just how far down a nasty rabbit hole the American idea of freedom has led us: to a place where conspiracy theories and hatred can be disseminated by US social media giants without any sanction at all. After all, it was almost exactly a year ago that presenters such as Sean Hannity on Fox News were given the freedom to accuse the media of \u201cscaring the living hell out of people\u201d with the \u201cnew hoax\u201d of the coronavirus. The rules regarding harm and offence governed by Ofcom\u2019s Broadcasting Code are written in the sort of legalese that would never go viral. Yet, along with public opinion, they are more or less the last bulwarks ensuring that the British broadcast media remains committed to offering as unbiased a version of events as is possible, unlike the newspapers, which are under no such mandate. The UK system is far from perfect, of course. Rumours that the Daily Mail\u2019s Paul Dacre is the prime minister\u2019s preferred candidate for the top job at Ofcom and the very history of BBC licence fee negotiations alone demonstrate this. But in a world in which the business model for news has been ripped up, broadcast regulation means that the influential media is not governed by commercial interests alone. Still, Morgan\u2019s last Good Morning Britain show on Tuesday was watched by 1.29m viewers, more than its much quieter BBC rival with 1.25m. The problem is that outrage sells, just look at the history of tabloid newspapers in the UK. Murdoch, who has possibly made more money out of the British media than anyone else, knows this. My money is on a new Piers Morgan morning show on the soon-to-be streamed News UK. The good news is that brilliant journalists of colour such as Ranvir Singh and Clive Myrie are already being tipped to replace the former host on Good Morning Britain. \u2022 Jane Martinson is a Guardian columnist", "author": "Bryan Armen Graham and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "14-hour days and no bathroom breaks: Amazon's overworked delivery drivers", "full_article": "   Sign up for the Guardian Today US newsletter   James Meyers worked as a driver for several Amazon delivery service providers in Austin, Texas, for about one year until he quit in October 2020 citing the immense workloads and poor working conditions. Fourteen-hour shifts were common because delivery service providers wouldn\u2019t allow drivers to return any packages from their routes and the pressure to meet delivery rates meant Meyers used a plastic bottle to go to the bathroom on a daily basis. \u201cI saw no effort on Amazon\u2019s part to push delivery service providers to allow their drivers to use the restroom on a normal human basis, leading many, myself included, to urinate inside bottles for fear of slowing down our delivery rates,\u201d Meyers said.   Related: 'We deserve more': an Amazon warehouse\u2019s high-stakes union drive    \u201cAny time a van is off route or stops for longer than three minutes, it notifies the delivery service provider. Amazon encourages the delivery service owners to cut down on said stops. I would personally get called by a dispatcher every time I stopped to go to the bathroom. Sitting on the phone with them made the stop take longer. It just wasn\u2019t worth the angry looks in the morning or the worry I\u2019d get fired.\u201d Amazon uses contractors for delivery services, a move Meyers said makes it exceedingly difficult for workers to organize, and he said, contributes to drivers being overworked and underpaid by the delivery service providers who are paid bonuses on metrics such as route completion percentages. Amazon has been publicly opposed to unionization and organizing among their employees, most recently through an anti-union campaign launched ahead of a union election vote at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, which has included anti-union captive audience meetings and sending mass texts and ads to workers encouraging them to vote against the union. The Teamsters Union is now working with drivers at Amazon delivery service providers around the US over concerns about the retail giant\u2019s impact on the transportation industry and use of subcontractors.     An Amazon delivery driver pushes a cart of groceries to load into a vehicle outside of a distribution facility on 2 February 2021 in Redondo Beach, California Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cThis sort of model is problematic for the entire industry,\u201d said Randy Korgan, the director of the Teamster\u2019s Amazon Project. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to loan these small subcontractors money, get them access to their vans and help them advertise for employees to offload all the responsibility that would normally fall on Amazon.\u201d The Teamsters currently represent pilots at two Amazon air transport contractors. Korgan said the wages Amazon delivery drivers receive, starting at $15 an hour, are far below the average wages for drivers at companies like UPS, where Teamsters represent about 240,000 workers. Based on the union\u2019s current contract, UPS drivers start at $21 an hour and can make up to $40 an hour or more. \u201cIf Amazon decides to take millions of jobs and essentially cut their labor costs in half, that only comes out of workers\u2019 pockets,\u201d added Korgan. \u201cThat creates a major economic problem in an industry that for the last 50 years has done a good job of supporting millions of middle-class jobs.\u201d In Iowa, the Des Moines Register reported the Teamsters are organizing drivers and warehouse workers at Amazon for higher pay and less stringent rates, utilizing strikes rather than focusing on union elections through the National Labor Relations Board. Drivers for Amazon contractors have complained of the surveillance and pressure they receive through cameras and a tracking app, Mentor. A driver for an Amazon delivery service provider in the Portland, Oregon area, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, expressed concerns over the surveillance cameras being installed in delivery vehicles, as she often has to use the bathroom in the van due to the lack of available public restrooms and pressure against taking time off of routes to use them. \u201cIn order to take a bathroom break, especially being a woman, we would have to be in an area that has a grocery store. That isn\u2019t always the case and even if it were, that would take at least 10 minutes off our drive time, in which our dispatch would wonder why we\u2019re falling behind,\u201d she said. \u201cSo instead, I keep a cup with me and wipes and I go to the bathroom in the back of my van. I\u2019m very concerned about the AI technology being installed in the vans, and being seen while I am urinating is just one of my concerns.\u201d Drivers for Amazon delivery service providers also face fear of retaliation for trying to organize in their workplaces. Derrick Flournoy worked as a driver for an Amazon Delivery Service Provider in Downers Grove, Illinois, for more than one year before he quit after experiencing retaliation from management for organizing an online chat for workers to discuss grievances on the job such as the lack of pay increases.    Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have gone back and forth every week about who is the wealthiest person in the world and I can\u2019t even pay my rent  Derrick Flournoy     \u201cI started the chat group on a Friday morning, and about an hour after the chat group was put up the manager took it down, which we didn\u2019t even know that he had the power to do if he wasn\u2019t included in the chat, and then he also disabled my ability within the entire app to even communicate with anybody, unless it was directly with management,\u201d said Flournoy, who filed an unfair labor practice charge through the Amazon Delivery Drivers Coalition against Amazon after he was removed from his work shift immediately after the incident. \u201cTo me, it was obvious retaliation, and it was his way of showing that he had power and if we didn\u2019t basically form a model of who he wanted, that he could take our hours.\u201d Flournoy made $16 an hour, which remained unchanged from when he started in December 2019 to when he left in February 2021, even as a 40-hour full-time work week wasn\u2019t guaranteed. \u201cSixteen dollars an hour isn\u2019t enough for the amount of work that we have to do. We\u2019re a representation of the wealthiest company in the world and we\u2019re barely making enough money to live,\u201d Flournoy added. \u201cI just think that it\u2019s crazy to me that Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk have gone back and forth every week about who is the wealthiest person in the world and I can\u2019t even pay my rent.

The research comes as police forces are under intense scrutiny in the year after the brutal killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police and the unprecedented wave of uprisings that followed. \n \n  \n  \n   \n    \n    Overpoliced, underprotected is a series focused on police violence in the US following one of the largest-scale uprisings in history.&nbsp;\n    A year on from the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, there are demands both inside the government and from grassroots movements to end the systemic racism and lethal force that has been embedded in police culture for centuries.&nbsp;\n    But with stark differences in approaches to reform and revolution, and the continued power of police unions, achieving sweeping change faces more obstacles than ever.\n    \n   \n  \n  \n \n\u201cThe nation is going to be looking at this [George Floyd case] with new consciousness and awareness, but [Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed Floyd] is being prosecuted under the same old laws and the same old system,\u201d said Sherri Williams, a professor at American University who writes about and analyzes race and representation. \n \n List of the 48 cities that were in the study. None of them have human-rights-compliant laws. \n \nThe findings by the University of Chicago Global Rights Clinic will appear in a forthcoming report, Global Impunity. In an analysis commissioned by the Guardian for our ongoing project Overpoliced, Underprotected, researchers compared a city\u2019s written use-of-force policies with several UN documents, including the UN code of conduct for law enforcement officials, which emphasizes that lethal force should only be used when officers are faced with immediate and grave threats to their own lives or the lives of others. \nThe research focuses on rich and developed nations in order to compare places with comparable resources. It includes disproportionately more US cities to provide a foundation for the scope of the project. \nIn the US, 987 people were killed by the police in the past year. The rate is almost triple that of the neighboring Canada and 30 times that of Germany. \n\u201cThe sheer number of countries, police departments in the US and across the globe that tell their police officers that you can use deadly force \u2013 shoot someone \u2013 if they are resisting arrest or running away is staggering,\u201d said Nino Guruli, one of the authors and a staff attorney at UIC John Marshall Law School\u2019s International Human Rights Clinic. \u201cAs if it is more important to complete an arrest or not retreat than to prevent unnecessary death and suffering.\u201dTo analyze use-of-force policies, the researchers used an evaluation scale based on four categories: whether a city\u2019s use of lethal force is considered legal under international law; whether lethal force can be used only for an immediate threat and only as last resort; whether it can be used only in response to an equally deadly threat; and whether police are accountable to an independent oversight body for the use of lethal force. \nIn 13 cities, the research found, officers are permitted to use lethal force even if they have not exhausted all the other options available to them, such as de-escalation tactics. \n \n Cities that have less stringent use of force policies. \n \nIn Denver, for instance, officers are allowed to use lethal force to arrest or prevent an escape of an individual based on past crime \u2013 without any requirement that the suspect pose a present and immediate threat: \n \n 105.2. A peace officer is justified in using deadly physical force \u2026 only when he reasonably believes that it is necessary: b. To effect an arrest or prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he reasonably believes: 1. Has committed or attempted to commit a felony involving the use or threatened use of deadly weapon \n \nSuch policies often come under increased scrutiny during highly public police brutality cases. The murder of Eric Garner \u2013 a New York man choked to death during his arrest \u2013 spurred a ban on chokeholds in the state after protests erupted across the country. Similarly, with the deaths of Floyd and Elijah McClain, who was also killed last year, civil rights lawyers have called into question whether police were acting under some kind of threat to their own lives. \nIn 25 cities, officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat, or when there is no immediate threat. \n \n Charts showing where officers are permitted to use deadly force in response to a lesser threat. \n \nThis can vary dramatically. Philadelphia has clear language prohibiting police officers from using deadly force if there is no longer an \u201cobjectively reasonable belief that the suspect is dangerous, even if the deadly force could have been justified at an earlier point in time\u201d. But in Indianapolis, the policy is far more opaque, only requiring a \u201cthreat of deadly force\u201d to act. \nAccountability for the use of lethal force is also often lacking. The researchers found that many police departments across the world don\u2019t require police to report when they use excessive force \u2013 even when it is deadly. This leads to both a lack of accountability for the use of lethal force among police forces and also a gap in the public\u2019s understanding of what happened, due in large part to the lack of adequate documentation. \nOnly eight cities require internal reporting of an officer who uses deadly force, and 16 cities require that reporting when it results in a death or injury. \n \n Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force. \n \nRichard Aborn, president of the Citizens Crime Commission of New York City, said the lack of reporting requirements can be dismal. \u201cIt\u2019s what message the police agency leadership sends. \n\u201cI think if we just did that \u2013 disciplined those cases \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t need to change these policies.\u201d \nBut if the cities are unlikely to report their use of force internally, reporting these incidents externally feels even harder to enforce. \n \n Cities that have less stringent reporting policies after officers use force. \n \n\u201cLaws and policies are critical to government accountability and transparency. This is especially true in the area of law enforcement where the state is granted the power to end human life,\u201d said Claudia Flores, report author and associate clinical professor of law and director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School.  \nCampaign groups are advocating a range of reforms. The demands include curbing the unchecked power of police unions, which often help create the use of force policies themselves, and requiring community oversight of negotiations within the contracts. \n\u201cWe have historical amnesia about how we really treat people in this country,\u201d said Williams. \u201cWe\u2019re acting like we don\u2019t really know [these policies] were designed to do what they\u2019re doing.\u201d \nThe research revealed \u2013 which may come as a surprise to those focusing on police brutality and systemic racism in the US \u2013 that New York City actually had the strongest policies and guidelines on excessive use of force, followed by Mexico City and Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, Riyadh, Mumbai and Paris occupied the lowest rankings on the list. \nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the top cities have better police departments, or fewer extrajudicial killings. A more comprehensive policy doesn\u2019t always denote accountability, or the power of law to enforce such a policy. \nIn the past year it has become increasingly clear that the power of police forces has gone unchecked for far too long. Since then, government and grassroots voices in the US have been demanding an end to centuries of racist and poor policing practices and policies. \nIn early March, the US House of Representatives voted on one of the most comprehensive police reform bills in the history of the country: the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. The legislation \u2013 which is unlikely to pass the Senate owing to Republican opposition \u2013 includes several sweeping changes to how police do their jobs, including a ban on chokeholds. \n \n  Related: These US cities defunded police: 'We're transferring money to the community'  \n \nThis year, the UN also convened a group of experts on the use of force. They called on the US to adopt wide-ranging reforms and end police brutality. They admonished police departments for using teargas and other harsh measures on protesters and recognized the increasing militarization of US police weapons. \n\u201cPolicing reforms must adopt genuine and substantive measures to dismantle systemic racism in policing, including against racial, ethnic and other minorities, by divestment from current policing budgets and reinvestment in alternative social and economic resources that are vital for the safety of these communities,\u201d they stated. \nBut those reforms in policies, and in laws, may come too late for the case that will determine whether the former police officer Derek Chauvin will be held accountable for kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck for more than eight minutes. \n\u201cLast summer was a summer of conversation,\u201d said Johnetta Elzie, a civil rights activist and co-founder of Campaign Zero, an advocacy and research group focused on ending police brutality. \u201cNow it depends on who and what entity cares enough to hold the police and police unions accountable.\u201d \nGlobal Impunity will be published in May and is authored by Claudia Flores, associate clinical professor of law and director of the Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School; Nino Guruli, staff attorney, UIC John Marshall Law School, International Human Rights Clinic; Brian Citro, human rights lawyer and independent researcher; Mariana Olaizola, fellow and faculty, Global Human Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School; and Chelsea Kehrer and Hannah Abrahams, students, University of Chicago Law School", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "China adopts new laws to ensure only 'patriots' can govern Hong Kong", "full_article": "China\u2019s rubber stamping parliamentary body has unanimously \u2013 bar one abstention and to sustained and loud applause \u2013 approved new laws ensuring that only people it deems \u201cpatriots\u201d can govern Hong Kong, in a move critics say signals the end of the city\u2019s remaining autonomy. The final meeting of the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) at the annual \u201ctwo sessions\u201d political gathering also approved new domestic amendments and budgets, and the 14th five-year-plan, intended to strengthen and expand China\u2019s domestic technology industry and market, and reach new GDP and population targets amid economic uncertainty and declining birth rates. In a formal vote the almost 3,000 NPC delegates approved a decision to amend Hong Kong\u2019s mini constitution, the basic law, and the electoral system to ensure that people opposed to the Chinese Communistparty and its rule over Hong Kong are ineligible to sit in the city\u2019s parliament. The UK\u2019s foreign minister, Dominic Raab, was quick to criticise the move. \u201cThis is the latest step by Beijing to hollow out the space for democratic debate in Hong Kong, contrary to the promises made by China itself,\u201d he said. \u201cThis can only further undermine confidence and trust in China living up to its international responsibilities and legal obligations as a leading member of the international community.\u201d According to Chinese state media, the decision will increase the number of seats in Hong Kong\u2019s legislature from 70 to 90, and the election committee charged with choosing a chief executive from 1,200 to 1,500. The published details did not say where the extra 20 seats would come from. Hong Kong\u2019s legislature currently includes 35 directly elected legislators, and 35 from mostly pro-Beijing representative constituencies. The changes will also establish a vetting panel responsible for \u201creviewing and confirming the qualifications\u201d of committee and political political candidates in line with the national security law and basic law. Early media reports cited unnamed sources as saying the panel would be made up of some of the most pro-Beijing members of Hong Kong\u2019s political elite, including delegates to the NPC and the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). \u201cThe meeting made the decision to approve the electoral system in Hong Kong, and won the approval from all deputies, including those from Hong Kong,\u201d said the chair of the NPC standing committee, Li Zhanshu. The decision will now go to the standing committee for further processing before it is promulgated. In the past year new laws and regulations in Hong Kong, including a draconian national security law and a concerted campaign of protest-related prosecutions, have resulted in almost every significant voice of opposition being in jail, on trial or in exile overseas. The changes have drawn international condemnation. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told Congress on Wednesday that the Biden administration would \u201cfollow through on sanctions \u2026 against those responsible for committing repressive acts in Hong Kong\u201d. The US and other countries have repeatedly objected to the crackdown with little effect. Hong Kong\u2019s government has welcomed the Beijing crackdown, including Thursday\u2019s changes, but has indicated it wasn\u2019t involved in the NPC\u2019s design of the details.

Two months after the UK left the EU on trade terms agreed by Boris Johnson\u2019s government, research from the manufacturing trade group Make UK has shown that 74% of firms in a survey of more than 200 leading industrial companies are facing delays with EU imports and exports. Faced with mounting Brexit red tape, customs checks and disruption to global trade caused by the pandemic, more than half of companies said they were suffering from increased costs. More than a third had lost out on sales, while fears over continued disruption was losing firms future business. The warning comes as pressure grows on the government to resolve difficulties at UK borders amid concern over the impact on the British economy and jobs at a time when businesses are grappling with the Covid recession. A government spokesperson insisted that freight volumes between the UK and the EU were now \u201cback to their normal levels\u201d and said there was \u201cno general disruption at UK ports\u201d. Ministers have made \u00a320m available to help small businesses adapt to the new trade relationships. \u201cWe will ensure businesses get the support they need to trade effectively with Europe and to seize new opportunities as we strike trade deals with the world\u2019s fastest-growing markets,\u201d the spokesperson added. However, business leaders said trading activity was under severe strain and only likely to worsen as further border checks came into force. Ray Singh, managing director of Russel Finex, a London-based manufacturer of high-performance sieves and filters, said his firm was still experiencing delays with exports to the EU and to a plant it operated in Belgium. \u201cEventually we manage to get the goods over, but it just takes a lot longer. It\u2019s not smooth like it was. There are additional checks and paperwork and it sounds like in a few months\u2019 time that\u2019s actually going to ramp up, which is more stuff not to look forward to. It\u2019s created a lot of extra bureaucracy that just wasn\u2019t there before,\u201d Singh said.  Catherine Bedford, founder of Dashel, which makes carbon fibre and recycled cycle helmets, said the disruption was killing her business. \u201cThanks to Brexit, we\u2019ve gone from profitable to barely scraping by,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t predict delivery times as items are being held up at French customs, our entry point into Europe. There is a massive backlog and items are being turned back despite up-to-date paperwork.\u201d Figures from Germany this week showed that imports from the UK had fallen by more than 56% to \u20ac1.6bn (\u00a31.4bn) in January from the same month a year ago amid Brexit disruption. Official UK trade figures are due to be published on Friday. The international trade secretary, Liz Truss, is pushing to expand trading opportunities outside the EU, and next week the government is expected to set out Britain\u2019s post-Brexit trade priorities as part of a delayed review of foreign policy. However, Make UK said that ministers urgently needed to \u201cget back around the table\u201d with EU leaders to solve problems closer to home. The EU accounts for almost half of UK imports and exports, while the government\u2019s own analysis suggests that trade deals outside the EU will not make up for the impact of Brexit on the UK economy.

Ivo van Aart\u2019s movie gives full rein to that desire and is snappily directed \u2013 but in the end there is something self-satisfied and sententious about his feminist revenge flick.

Wilson, his agent has been at pains to point out, has not officially demanded a trade from Seattle, but he has \u2013 in a delightfully passive-aggressive, Wilson-esque way \u2013 made it clear to the team\u2019s decision-makers that he is unhappy with the direction of the franchise and that he would prefer to leave.  According to a detailed report in The Athletic, Wilson is unhappy with the team\u2019s roster construction, the style of head coach/chief decision-maker Pete Carroll, and the Seahawks\u2019 offensive system.  At the center of the rift are two practical elements. First, Wilson\u2019s desire to play in a modern, pace-and-space system similar to that which the Kansas City Chiefs have built around Patrick Mahomes, with everything flowing through the quarterback. Second, Seattle\u2019s awful offensive line, one that has ranked dead stinking last in pressure rate in three out of the past five seasons.  Carroll is an old-school, pound-the-run, play-solid-defense, don\u2019t-turn-the-ball-over, coach. That served Wilson and the Seahawks well during the early years of the duo\u2019s partnership. Behind an all-time defense, a bulldozing run-game led by Marshawn Lynch, and the playmaking brilliance of Wilson, the team went to back-to-back Super Bowls, winning one and losing the other. But as Wilson matured into one of the most well-rounded quarterbacks in the game and the roster around him disintegrated, Carroll did not evolve. He freed up the scheme and catered the system to Wilson in part, but the foundations remained run-first and risk-averse.    Related: Dak Prescott agrees to four-year, $160m contract with Dallas Cowboys    Whereas Wilson looked in the mirror and saw Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning \u2013 quarterbacks with the freedom to change the play at the line of scrimmage and who had near-complete autonomy over the system \u2013 Carroll looked at his quarterback and saw a fantastic cog in his machine. The scheme still won out. All the while, Wilson was taking a beating \u2013 no quarterback has been hit more since he entered the league, and no quarterback has been hit at the same rate over a three-year span as Wilson has between 2018-2021. There was a change in philosophy last season though. After a three-year drum beat of #LetRussCook, an online movement that began to infiltrate the locker room \u2013 shorthand for Let Russell Wilson Pass More \u2013 Carroll handed Wilson the reins to the offense.  Still: the quarterback was seen as a player, not a collaborator. He was not offered the kind of quarterback-coach partnership that Rodgers, Manning and Brady had at the peak of their powers, the kind that Wilson believes he has earned over nine years. \u201cI know that I\u2019m a great football player,\u201d Wilson said last season. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been great, I know I will be great, and I know I\u2019ll continue to be great.\u201d And Wilson was great at the start of the 2020 season. Behind\u2019s Wilson\u2019s excellence, Seattle averaged four-and-a-half touchdowns per game over the first half of the season, the kind of total matched only by the Brady led Patriots of 2007, Manning\u2019s 2013 Broncos, and the 2000 Rams \u2013 widely regarded as the best offensive teams of this century.  It was a stunning rebuke of the Carroll doctrine. Wilson had finally been allowed to cook, and he proved to be the best chef in the game. Through eight weeks, he topped the MVP charts; even Mahomes could not keep pace. Wilson was able to maintain all of the efficiency that has defined his game with even more explosiveness.  And then he cratered. After his best start to a season, Wilson flatlined over the final eight weeks. For the first time in his career, he finished outside the top 10 in Football Outsiders\u2019 DVOA metric, a measure of a quarterback\u2019s down-to-down efficiency (Wilson has been a demigod of DVOA over the span of his career). In a blink, Carroll returned to the Seahawks\u2019 style of old. When Wilson tried to offer some input into the gameplan in the middle of last season\u2019s decline, he was rebuffed by the coaching staff. Wilson stormed out of the meeting.  Like any great drama, Wilson\u2019s real beef is not about how the team does things. It\u2019s about respect. He wants to be a partner, a part of a decision-making board, not an employee. \u201cThe most important people in the building,\u201d Seahawks general manager John Schneider told reporters back in 2018, \u201care the head coach and the quarterback.\u201d Wilson wants to hold him to that. And then there\u2019s his need for external respect. For all of his excellence, for all of the plaudits, Wilson has still never received a single MVP vote. By throwing more, by posting the kind of numbers he did over the first half of last season for 16 games, he thinks he can finally get his hands on the MVP \u2013 that stuff really, really matters to Wilson.  At the most important position in the sport, Wilson has been the game\u2019s most consistent performer for the better part of a decade, and this despite the sense that the Seahawks system has held him back. Seattle\u2019s rebuttal is an obvious one: Wilson has been good because of the system and its risk-averse nature, not in spite of it. When the handbrake came off, it proved to be unsustainable. The eye test \u2013 which often involves Wilson running here, there, and everywhere to avoid pressure \u2013 does not jibe with the team\u2019s assessment. Tired of getting hit. Tired of playing in a plodding system. Tired of not being the sole focus of the franchise, Wilson appears to want out. Like another unsettled quarterback, Deshaun Watson, Wilson has a no-trade clause in his contract, arming him with a ton of leverage over the Seahawks \u2013 he will have more say than the team on where he plays in 2021 and beyond if he does move. His agent told ESPN that while Wilson will not demand an official trade, he has made it known to the Seahawks hierarchy the teams he would be willing to waive his no-trade clause to move to the Cowboys, Saints, Raiders, or Bears. Dak Prescott\u2019s new bumper deal rules Dallas out, while it seems increasingly likely that Drew Brees will return for one final ride with the Saints. That leaves us with the Raiders and Bears.   Related: Wilson to the Raiders? Watson to the Jets? NFL quarterback trade possibilities    Chicago make the most sense. The only way for the Bears to improve this offseason is to trade for a game-changing quarterback, either Wilson or Watson. The Bears have two paths heading into 2021: they land a franchise-altering quarterback and are a playoff team with holes on the roster; or they improve marginally at quarterback \u2013 either with Mitchell Trubisky developing or by landing another option in free agency \u2013 and they fall short again. It\u2019s impractical for Chicago to think their defense can hold up at a high level for another season. Wilson knows how quickly elite defenses age. They\u2019re great, then they stink. A good defense is never as a reliable as a good offense: a defense requires 20 talented players, an excellent scheme and a savvy play-caller; an offense can thrive with a great quarterback and a couple of talented pieces. There are very few deals that the Bears should turn down. Hand over the roster sheet, ask the Seahawks what they want, and include whatever picks are needed to flesh out the deal. Put the pressure on Seattle to turn it down and on Wilson to say yes or no. Has this offseason noise been hot air? Are the Wilson comments and leaks about airing grievances, about politics, about public relations? Or is he really looking for a change of scenery and a better shot to win an MVP and a championship? The Bears are the ones who can force the issue. It\u2019s a small window, but it\u2019s one the Bears and Wilson should both try to take advantage of. Wilson has spent much of his career as a polished professional. On a team that was infamously loud and outspoken \u2013 a loudness encouraged by the coach \u2013 he was the quiet one, to the point where his teammates questioned his motives. Now, in the era of quarterback empowerment, when Watson is talking of early retirement to force Houston\u2019s hand and Matthew Stafford was able to force a move out of Detroit, Wilson has a chance to make his move. For a man who cares so much about his legacy, how he leaves a place appears to be essential. It\u2019s why he\u2019s playing footsie with other teams while Watson chose to hit the burn-it-all-down button. To force a move out of Seattle, Wilson may have to follow Watson\u2019s lead.

In the 1980s the school is run by French nuns to educate the daughters of Rwanda\u2019s elite, training them \u201cnot simply to be good wives and mothers, but also good citizens and good Christians \u2026 to spearhead women\u2019s advancement\u201d. National tensions are rarely explicitly addressed in the business of school life, but a sinister dynamic unnerves the reader from early on with the arrival of Gloriosa, who \u201cstepped out of a black Mercedes with tinted windows, preceded by her mother\u201d. The mother has to rush back to the city for dinner with the Belgian ambassador, but \u201cGloriosa announced that she would stand with Sister Gertrude at the gate, beneath the national flag, to greet the other seniors and let them know that the first meeting of the committee she chaired would take place the following day\u201d. Gloriosa\u2019s rival Goretti \u201calso made a grand entrance, perched on the back of a huge military vehicle whose six thick tyres took the spectators\u2019 breath away\u201d, alongside soldiers in camouflage fatigues. Against the background of landscape description and a playful postcolonial history of the school, these two cars are enough for us to understand that something darker lies beneath the comic accounts of adolescence that follow. The girls, given unfamiliar food by a French cook, bicker over treats brought from home for midnight feasts: \u201cBeans and cassava paste, with a special sauce \u2026 bananas slowly baked overnight \u2026 red gahungezi sweet potatoes; corncobs; peanuts; and even, for the city girls, doughnuts of every colour under the sun.\u201d They take walks in the long rainy season, compare their growing bodies, tease and boast about boyfriends, make fun of \u201cMr Hair\u201d, a young French maths teacher on voluntary service overseas. They are, perhaps, more realistic about their own future prospects than their teachers are: \u201cWe were already fine merchandise,\u201d says Immacul\u00e9e, \u201cand a diploma will inflate our worth even more.\u201d For a while, the spats between girls who take the convent ideology seriously and those who regard the routines of study and prayer as an inconvenience seem as serious as those between the daughters of Hutu \u201cmajority people\u201d and the two girls who constitute the required quota of Tutsis. These two, Veronica and Virginia, take to sneaking off into the forest to visit the Parisian Monsieur de Fontenaille, who in youth \u201cset off for Africa to seek his fortune\u201d and is now a kind of heart of whiteness, Conrad\u2019s Kurtz replayed as farce. Monsieur de Fontenaille has developed an obsession with painting the portraits of Tutsi girls, convinced that he alone can restore to the Tutsis the ancestral memory of their heritage in \u201cthe empire of black pharaohs\u201d. He wants to paint Veronica as the goddess Isis and Virginia as Queen Candace, apparently believing them to be descendants or even reincarnations of the ancient rulers of his fantasies. \u201cI don\u2019t think he even sees the same landscape as we do,\u201d says Veronica. \u201cIt\u2019s like a movie playing in his head, but now he wants flesh-and-blood actresses, and that\u2019s us.\u201d He drugs the girls, not primarily to assault them but to dress them in the costumes and masks of his pharaonic/Tutsi myth of origin. Veronica knows perfectly well what\u2019s going on, but the money she finds in her bra is useful. This post-colonial satire is the background to Virginia and Veronica\u2019s more acute danger, which comes from Gloriosa, the society waiting to believe her lies and the thugs at her father\u2019s command. The ending is violent, bleak and wholly believable.

Annette Kimmitt left MinterEllison on Wednesday, a week after she told staff in an email she was \u201ctriggered\u201d by news that senior partner Peter Bartlett was acting for a cabinet minister at the centre of a rape allegation. MinterEllison\u2019s chairman, David O\u2019Brien, told staff via an email sent about 10pm on Wednesday that Kimmitt had left, and would be replaced in an acting capacity by managing partner Virginia Briggs.

The night before, the Guardian reported that Bartlett was acting for the minister, who was expected to break his silence regarding the allegations the following day. Kimmitt wrote: \u201cYou have no doubt all read, heard and seen the press today that one of our partners is acting on a high profile matter. \u201cUnfortunately, like you, I only became aware last night that the firm is acting, through Twitter and media reports. \u201cThe acceptance of this matter did not go through the firm\u2019s due consultation or approval processes.

Kimmitt\u2019s email was leaked to the Australian Financial Review and published last Friday, as tensions started to boil over within the firm. Porter had been a client at the firm since October, when he contacted Bartlett about potentially defamatory material posted on YouTube. The material did not mention the rape allegation. At the time he was contacted by Porter, Bartlett was also acting for prime minister Scott Morrison in an unrelated matter. When it became clear Porter had a relationship with the firm predating the publication of the rape allegation by more than four months, Kimmitt\u2019s critics viewed her email as even more problematic. The firm\u2019s policy may not have required Bartlett to get approval for a matter as insignificant as advice about YouTube material, and Kimmitt had implied the decision to take the case had been made recently. Broader issues were also at play. Bartlett is the most senior lawyer at the firm, and is well respected. He has acted as a defamation lawyer for many of Australia\u2019s major media companies. Kimmitt does not have a law degree, and her email was viewed as undermining a fundamental principle of the profession \u2013 the right to fair representation. She had not spoken with Bartlett before sending the email, which, while it did not name him, clearly identified him and was critical of his conduct. Kimmitt has championed equality for women, including addressing the gender pay gap, and has been vocal about the need for MinterEllison to be a leader in the field, but some colleagues viewed the email as evidence her passion clouded her judgment. The firm also handles tens of millions of dollars in federal government contracts.

Senior department officials confirmed on Thursday that a contract had been awarded by limited select tender to HealthEngine to manage vaccination bookings. The revelation came during a hearing of the Senate committee monitoring the Morrison government\u2019s pandemic response. HealthEngine, an online booking service for 70,000 GPs and health practices around Australia, claims to have 1.5m monthly users. Its major investors include Telstra and Seven West Media.   Related: Government walks away from promise to 'fully vaccinate' all Australians by October    Caroline Edwards, associate secretary at the Department of Health, acknowledged that HealthEngine had been involved in legal proceedings initiated by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. \u201cMy advice on this issue is the issues associated with the ACCC proceedings are historical in nature, weren\u2019t intentional, and did not involve the sharing of medical or clinical information,\u201d Edwards told Thursday\u2019s hearing. Edwards said that following the ACCC\u2019s intervention, the company had strengthened its privacy and security processes to increase data security and protect personal information. She said the company had been \u201cthoroughly evaluated\u201d by the health department before the contract was awarded, and it would not have access to clinical information \u201cover what is required\u201d to book an appointment for a Covid vaccine. \u201cThere will be very limited information,\u201d Edwards said. \u201cIn summary, we think there has been enormous improvements made by HealthEngine \u2013 we tested these very carefully when we considered them for contract and they won\u2019t be privy to the sort of information we would be most concerned about in any event.\u201d The Labor senator Murray Watt asked whether the department was concerned about awarding the contract to the company, given the recent fine by Australia\u2019s consumer regulator. Edwards said the department had taken steps to satisfy itself that the previous issues would \u201cnot affect the current contract\u201d. Watt asked Edwards: \u201cWhy was a company, with this sort of record, preferred over other companies that had not been penalised for engaging in misleading conduct relating to sharing patient private information?\u201d Edwards said HealthEngine was judged by officials to be the preferred provider for the service on a range of criteria.

The chair of the Senate committee, shadow finance minister Katy Gallagher, asked whether the company had been invited to pitch for the work given the tender had been awarded through a limited select process. \u201cI believe so,\u201d Edwards said, adding this was a \u201cstandard and appropriate\u201d procedure. Edwards said she did not have the dollar value of the contract to hand. The ACCC says in the legal proceedings HealthEngine admitted that between 30 April 2014 and 30 June 2018 it gave non-clinical personal information, such as names, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, of more than 135,000 patients to third party private health insurance brokers without adequately disclosing this to consumers. The regulator said HealthEngine had earned more than $1.8m from its arrangements with private health insurance brokers during this period. The federal court last August ordered the company to pay $2.9m in penalties for engaging in misleading conduct \u201cin relation to the sharing of patient personal information to private health insurance brokers and publishing misleading patient reviews and ratings\u201d the regulator said. The ACCC said the company also admitted that between 31 March 2015 and 1 March 2018, \u201cit did not publish around 17,000 reviews and edited around 3,000 reviews to remove negative aspects, or to embellish them\u201d. \u201cHealthEngine also admitted that it misrepresented to consumers the reasons why it did not publish a rating for some health or medical practices,\u201d the consumer watchdog said. During the legal action, the company said in a statement that it recognised \u201cthat our rapid growth over the years has sometimes outpaced our systems and processes and we sincerely apologise if that has meant we have not always met the high expectations of us\u201d. The company said it was \u201cworking hard to rebuild the trust we\u2019ve lost with patients and practices\u201d.

The health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, said adults would be offered a vaccine by the end of October, but it was possible they may not have the required two injections by that time. Murphy said that didn\u2019t matter, because people would be \u201cfully protected by the first dose\u201d.

Being alone has been a relief | Naoise Dolan", "full_article": "I haven\u2019t socialised with anyone in six months and it is entirely my fault. I live in London and have friends within walking distance. There are many more elsewhere who I owe a Zoom. Dozens of people have messaged and I\u2019ve been too anxious to reply; I just hope they\u2019re thinking that I\u2019m doing my best. As a result of my own decisions, I have not said a word aloud to someone who is not my colleague, family member or flatmate since September. And I\u2019ve thrown up on the latter, so he\u2019s basically family, too. Is this some bogus monastic sacrifice? Am I resistance-training for all possible levels of a future lockdown? No, I\u2019m just autistic, and it does not take a lot to overwhelm me. There are some autistic people who rarely or never speak. That\u2019s not me. I can usually talk when I need to. But then the decisions start. The verbal ones: when a casual acquaintance asks how I am, there are several permissible answers and all of them are lies. Say their name around as often as they say mine. When they request advice, back up the thing they\u2019re already planning on doing, or dispense a platitude that would not withstand the mildest scrutiny. When they say \u201cHave a good day\u201d, say \u201cThe same to you\u201d if they\u2019re Irish, or \u201cYou too\u201d if they\u2019re not. (Possibly both replies are interchangeable, but I\u2019ve noticed a pattern and will stick to it pending further information.) I need to script and consciously deploy all of this because I have no filter and even less autopilot.    I don't dislike people. It\u2019s the opposite: I love everyone and I give every conversation my all, which is exhausting    Then there are non-verbal decisions. If there\u2019s a sudden noise, I have to hide that I\u2019m now thinking about the source and nature of said noise. When I\u2019m really, properly listening to people, my face is blank; this often makes them think I\u2019m bored, so I redistribute some of my concentration to intermittently changing my expression. How should I tilt my jaw? When should I tilt my jaw? Don\u2019t fidget, though it helps me puzzle things out, because they\u2019ll think I\u2019m nervous and try to \u201chelp\u201d me and then I\u2019ll lose my train of thought. Don\u2019t laugh, because my laughter can just as easily mean I\u2019m sad or shocked as that I\u2019m amused, but they mightn\u2019t see it that way if they\u2019re describing their grandma\u2019s funeral. None of this is because I dislike people. Actually, it\u2019s the opposite: I love everyone and I give every conversation my all, which is exhausting. And I don\u2019t have to do all this because autistic people are objectively worse at communicating. I have to do all this because most non-autistic people cannot competently adapt to my way of talking, and so the burden falls on me to adapt to theirs. We\u2019re just as good as anyone else, but we\u2019re a widely misunderstood minority and we have to conduct ourselves accordingly. To me, the need for eye contact is bizarre. It feels way too intense when I don\u2019t know someone well. I only look people in the eye to accommodate their needs. (You\u2019re welcome, guys.) There\u2019s always a tradeoff. One of my autistic friends who has known me since university was puzzled to watch as I went from doing less than her to blend in, to doing more. Neither of us had made an easy decision: \u201cmasking\u201d your autism is not good, but it is encouraged. Hiding our real selves leads to emotional repression, an inability to be genuine with anyone, and a cognitive tax that diminishes the million more interesting things we could be doing with our minds. But society punishes us if we don\u2019t do it. Not all autistics can mask in the first place \u2013 it certainly took me a lot of work to get any good at it \u2013 so if you do \u201csuccessfully\u201d mask, there\u2019s also an element of survivor\u2019s guilt, a feeling that you\u2019re distancing yourself from everyone else on the spectrum.    Different noises, tastes, textures and temperatures need to be planned for and worked around, or else they\u2019ll crowd my head and I might shut down    No one should want autistics to mask. It\u2019s like making us do everything with the wrong hand. It hurts us, and robs everyone of the potential of us being ourselves. But they hate us so much that they don\u2019t care what they\u2019re losing, and I can\u2019t think about that too long without getting sad. In some ways, the pandemic has lessened the pressure on me to socialise. What no one tells you about writing a book is that you\u2019ll have to talk about it a lot. Plus there are fewer logistical nightmares when everything\u2019s happening remotely. If I have to catch a train in the afternoon, I can\u2019t do anything that morning; I\u2019m too anxious and wary of becoming distracted. When I\u2019ll be in a new venue for the first time, I look it up on Google maps and scour the website to get a feel for where everything is \u2013 a form of pre-familiarisation I had no idea was a common autism adjustment until I saw that some libraries offer it. Different noises, tastes, textures and temperatures need to be planned for and worked around, or else they\u2019ll crowd my head and I might shut down. My organisation and sensory responses are often wildly out of sync with what\u2019s expected of me, and the task of planning around this can feel like a full-time job in itself. I have managed to give my publisher headaches around matters like collecting bookplates and mixing up Zoom times, but I think by publishing my book during a pandemic, I have had a gentler time. That said, 2020 was for me, as for everyone, an unambiguously terrible year. I wish I could see socialising as a source of comfort. But I can\u2019t. For me it\u2019s more stress, anxiety and fear that I\u2019m doing everything wrong. That\u2019s not my friends\u2019 fault. They can, and do, reassure me explicitly that they want me to be myself around them. The pain runs deeper than that: it\u2019s settled in my bones that I need to mask with other people, even other autistics. My childhood taught me that, my adolescence confirmed it, and my adulthood proves it every day.  That\u2019s why fiction is enormously important to me. Novels have always served as case studies of how most people think. The social observations of Jane Austen, Zadie Smith, Bernardine Evaristo, Edward St Aubyn, Alan Hollinghurst; they all make me stop and go: oh, that\u2019s why. And once I understand, I can do it. Like an aspiring footballer who pauses the game, I take my time reading conversations , to work out who said what, and why. Then, when I go out and do the real thing, I\u2019m more confident. And I do love it. That\u2019s why I put so much work in. I\u2019m endlessly grateful for fiction, because there\u2019s no telling how isolated I\u2019d feel without it. Books are why I have friends at all, even if I can\u2019t always keep up with them. So though I have not been talking much these past few months, I have been reading a lot. And believe it or not, after six months without socialising, what finally gave me the push to do better was writing this.

At that point there was already 30-odd years\u2019 worth of anecdotal evidence that heading the ball caused brain trauma. The Astle verdict meant there was now an official recognition of a link. The Guardian called it a \u201clandmark verdict\u201d. An official at the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association reassured the players, and public, that the PFA and the FA had \u201cbegun joint research\u201d into how heading a football affects the brain.  \u201cWe cannot do anything about what has gone on in the past,\u201d the spokesman said, \u201cbut maybe we can do something about the future.\u201d   Related: Women and girls face double the risk of concussion in sport, British MPs are told    Eighteen years into that future, on 15 October 2020, the North Wales coroner John Gittins reached the same verdict in the case of the former Wales midfielder Alan Jarvis. It was the first such case since Astle\u2019s. Jarvis\u2019s family said at the time that they felt the authorities had been trying to \u201csweep the issue under the carpet\u201d. The Daily Mail called the case a \u201clandmark verdict\u201d. And in the weeks afterwards, as the relatives of more and more retired footballers spoke about how their families were suffering, an official at the PFA came forward again. The language was more urgent now, and came with a clear acknowledgment that the game had a problem, but it still ended with the promise that the union and the FA \u201cwere committed to funding further research\u201d. Which sounded wearisomely familiar. \u201cAll scientific work is incomplete,\u201d wrote the epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill, who was instrumental in establishing the links between smoking and lung cancer. \u201cWhether it be observational or experimental. All scientific work is liable to be upset or modified by advancing knowledge. That does not confer upon us a freedom to ignore the knowledge that we already have, or to postpone the action that it appears to demand at a given time.\u201d    A lot changed in those last two decades, but the question of whether sport should have gone further, faster, remains    A lot changed in those last two decades. There has been progress in football, and across all contact and collision sports, but the question of whether more could have been done sooner, whether sport should have gone further, faster, remains. It seemed to hang over the opening day of the digital, culture, media and sport committee\u2019s inquiry into concussion in sport on Tuesday. You could hear hints of it in the MPs\u2019 questions about who was funding the current research, and how much they were paying, whether there was material out there that hadn\u2019t been published, about the workings of the Concussion in Sport group, and whether we need more transparency in research. It came up directly after the neuropathologist Willie Stewart described football\u2019s current concussion substitute protocols as \u201ca shambles\u201d. The Astle case was 19 years ago, said the committee chair, Julian Knight. \u201cYet we are talking about football protocols being \u2018a shambles\u2019. Why are we letting people down in this way? What is the problem in terms of our sporting bodies?\u201d Stewart said he shared Knight\u2019s \u201cfrustration\u201d, but preferred to look forward: \u201cThe challenge is not to make the same mistake again, where we all get together in 20 years\u2019 time and say: \u2018What has happened? Nothing!\u2019\u201d     Alan Jarvis in his Hull playing days in 1970. The verdict of death by industrial disease at his 2020 inquest was the first such verdict in the case of a footballer since Jeff Astle\u2019s. Photograph: Colorsport/Shutterstock    This is an argument that comes up a lot in conversations with, and between, the growing number of academics, campaigners and researchers working in this field. There\u2019s a theory that the reason the pace of change has been so slow is because the threat of litigation has put the governing authorities on the defensive, that the worry about whether they will be blamed for what they did wrong has made them reluctant to engage with suggestions about what they might do right. Advocates argue that everyone involved needs to take a more collaborative and constructive approach. It\u2019s an idea that underpins some of the new campaign groups that have been set up in recent months, such as Head For Change. Which figures. Back is not the best way to move forward. Only it does leave a lot of awkward questions unanswered. Questions such as, to pick one of many, what became of the work published in 1998, four years before the Astle verdict, by a team of researchers working in the Netherlands under Dr Erik Matser? The Guardian reported at the time that Matser\u2019s team had found clear evidence that \u201cheading a football can cause long-term brain damage\u201d. One of the co-authors explained: \u201cThe mental impairment of the players is subtle and would go unnoticed by many people, however this type of brain injury may last forever.\u201d In the long term, though, Matser\u2019s work didn\u2019t lead anywhere. He has his own ideas about what happened and why, which he has spoken about in a recent interview with the Dutch newspaper NRC.     Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.   The inquiry itself already feels too small, and underresourced, to dig into these issues in this kind of detail. Ninety minutes into the opening session the chair was already asking interviewees to \u201ckeep their answers concise\u201d because \u201cwe\u2019re relatively short of time\u201d. There\u2019s so much to cover, complicated questions of science, sociology and policy, across so many sports at youth, amateur and professional level. It has made for some awkward moments, with neurologists asked to provide expert testimony on issues of public health policy, and population psychology, and meant there have been some conspicuous gaps in the range of topics covered. It is valuable work. But, 19 years after the Astle verdict, it still feels like late in the day to be beginning all over. And we\u2019ll have to wait and see whether, this time, it leads to a real step forward in how sport handles these issues.", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "'I learned about storytelling from Final Fantasy': novelist Raven Leilani on Luster and video games", "full_article": "There is an extraordinary and telling moment in Raven Leilani\u2019s acclaimed novel Luster, about a young black woman who has an affair with a middle-aged white man and ends up living with his family. The woman, Edie, is heading back to her lover\u2019s house with his adopted black daughter, Akila, when the pair are stopped and questioned by two police officers. Although Edie is compliant, Akila \u2013 younger and much less worldly \u2013 challenges the cops and gets thrust to the ground and restrained. The confrontation is rife with fear and tension, and when it\u2019s over (diffused when Akila\u2019s white mother intervenes), the first thing Edie and Akila do is go inside, sit down and play a video game. Much of the fervid discussion around Luster has focused on Leilani\u2019s astute and witty analysis of sexual politics and racial power structures in the 21st-century US. But a key part of her acutely realised portrayal of a millennial protagonist coping with crappy jobs and crappier love affairs is Edie\u2019s natural relationship with digital culture and technology. At a time in which video game references are still mostly consigned to YA and sci-fi books, Leilani has made them a central component of a literary novel.     \u2018It has so much to do with memory\u2019 \u2026 Final Fantasy 7. Photograph: Square Enix    She has, it turns out, been a keen video game player since she was five years old. It was her much older brother who introduced her to the Nintendo Entertainment System, the two playing titles such as Duck Hunt and Super Mario together. \u201cHe\u2019d absolutely obliterate me,\u201d she relates, over a Zoom call. \u201cHe was living away from home by then, so, in between his visits, I\u2019d train so that I could beat him.\u201d From there, she moved on to the original PlayStation. \u201cJust booting it up, the sound it played \u2013 I still feel like I have that sound in my head,\u201d she says. \u201cI started playing Tekken and Street Fighter. Me and my cousins would gather round the console and get really involved in the stories. It was how I learned to relate to other people, emotionally.\u201d The games she really loved were Japanese role-playing adventures \u2013 especially the Final Fantasy series. In Luster, Edie is evicted from her New York apartment at the beginning of her affair with middle-aged archivist Eric \u2013 it\u2019s his wife, Rebecca, who insists on taking Edie into the home. It is through video games that Edie copes with this weird domestic dynamic, playing a fantasy adventure of Leilani\u2019s own invention, about an amnesiac army mail clerk trying to find his family. \u201cIt\u2019s totally a Final Fantasy rip-off!\u201d she admits. \u201cI was hoping for it to feel familiar to readers. I definitely lean heavily on Final Fantasy VII as the main reference point, especially as that game has so much to do with memory \u2013 it gave me a portal to talk about Edie and Akila\u2019s formative contexts.\u201d    When you\u2019re a part of a fandom, there is love but also a sense of ownership and discernment about the games you like    Leilani drew on her own experience as a preteen geek, into games and comics, to depict Akila\u2019s fandom. Living with white parents in a white suburb, the character feels alienated and marginalised, but role-playing games provide her with worlds in which she gets to be the central component. \u201cWhen I wrote Akila, I was writing toward that younger version of myself \u2013 when you\u2019re a part of a fandom and you love something so much, there is love but also a sense of ownership and discernment about the games you like and the games you feel other people shouldn\u2019t like. Akila and Edie have their own tastes, but they are able to bond and find communion through gaming.\u201d Many readers will recognise that communal experience. RPGs are almost always single-player games, but a lot of us play with friends, shouting instructions to the person holding the controller. \u201cI grew up playing them in a room full of my cousins and friends,\u201d says Leilani, \u201cand we identified with different characters in the party. So when I was writing those scenes that\u2019s what I was trying to replicate \u2013 that feeling of being on a fantasy journey with another person and the way that can parallel the development of an interpersonal relationship.\u201d      Luster \u2013 which has been longlisted for the Women\u2019s prize for fiction \u2013 is incredibly interesting in the way it explores the serrated boundaries between reality and fantasy. Edie\u2019s relationship with Eric is an unrealistic construct that began as an online dalliance, and the strange domestic arrangement they find themselves in \u2013 an awkward open marriage that becomes an interracial nuclear family \u2013 is a fantasy, too, as ad-hoc, experimental and fabricated as a household in The Sims. The climax of the book takes place at a Comic-Con event \u2013 another highly fabricated fantasy space. Amid all this unreality, Akila\u2019s gaming sessions with Edie are about the only emotionally real thing going on. There\u2019s a lovely scene where Akila wakes Edie in the middle of the night and tells her she thinks she\u2019s solved one of the game\u2019s big puzzles. She then carefully observers Edie playing the game, watching how she interacts with non-player characters, as a kind of test of her empathy. When she sees Edie being kind in the game, she removes the wig she\u2019s been wearing and shows that she has burned her scalp applying sodium hydroxide. It is a starkly personal revelation: she has no one to help her with her hair. \u201cVideo games allow a different kind of vulnerability,\u201d says Leilani. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing with another person, the engagement you have with the character, the story, the journey \u2013 it makes for a collaborative, communal experience that Edie and Akila are desperately searching for. It\u2019s also worth noting that these are two black women who move through the world with that layer of self-protection who are gravitating toward this safe space. The fantasy game provides a place for them to relate to each other where they don\u2019t have to be concerned with the curated self.\u201d So, that\u2019s why it is so important, in that terrifying scene with the police officers, that it is video games the two characters turn to. \u201cGames are not simply an escape from the real world, they\u2019re a place to process what has happened in the real world,\u201d says Leilani. \u201cThat\u2019s how it has worked for me. I\u2019m extremely introverted and I\u2019m naturally inclined to more solitary activities. I want to be sucked into an experience.\u201d   Related: Luster by Raven Leilani review \u2013 a millennial novel for the ages    When I ask Leilani if playing Final Fantasy has influenced her approach to storytelling, she nods enthusiastically. Luster is filled with beautiful, intricate observations \u2013 she places brand names, specific disco songs and other cultural artefacts with the exactness of an artist setting up a still life painting. This, she says, is something she learned from RPGs. \u201cYou follow a character on this journey of self-discovery, and I like the work that it entails. I like going into villagers\u2019 houses and finding what\u2019s there, I like talking to NPCs and exhausting my options. I love being rewarded for that attention and rigour \u2026 It\u2019s hard to articulate the magic of a world that responds to you in that way. \u201cRPGs represent something that is central to making art, which is data collection and attention. You have to be rigorous and curious \u2013 because curiosity, too, is central to art,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to seek out the gifts that are built into the world. Playing those games and seeing how they work and knowing how to advance not just the game but the character in their journey, helped give me patience for the accumulation of small epiphanies and small interactions. \u201cAll of it means something \u2013 that\u2019s the most succinct way I can put it.

I feel like it\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Frampton\u2019s brand of self-analysis is fascinating. By rights he can already consider his achievements on a global stage worthy of great satisfaction. It feels as if turning 34 recently somehow intensifies his drive. That and, perhaps, the lofty status Northern Ireland affords its sporting legends. \u201cPeople say you shouldn\u2019t care too much about how others see you but I do,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to be remembered very fondly as a good fighter, a good person.

Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images    Little more than two years ago, Frampton considered his boxing in the past tense. Defeat against Josh Warrington triggered what ultimately \u2013 and thankfully \u2013 wasn\u2019t defining dejection. \u201cIn my head for two weeks I was a retired fighter,\u201d Frampton recalls. \u201cThen I just sat down and had a think rationally about things. It wasn\u2019t a case of me being over the hill, it was a bad performance on the night and that happens at the top level in sport. I thought it would be a shame to end my career on a sour note like that. I felt like I could win another world title again. I wouldn\u2019t have come back if I didn\u2019t have that belief. I\u2019m within touching distance of it now.\u201d He admits that one day, in the not-so-distant future, the show will indeed have to stop. \u201cThirty was the age I wanted to retire at for a long time. A lot of that was down to not enjoying boxing. I don\u2019t want to go on too long, I won\u2019t be boxing at 40, I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ll be boxing at 36, so I\u2019m not too far from the end. Still a wee bit left to give but not too much more. \u201cI haven\u2019t been in too many brutal fights but the training camps take it out of you. They have a massive impact on your body. I want to have a long life after boxing with my wife and kids. Wear and tear and the brutality of training camps take their toll. I genuinely believe the real hard training camps could take years off your life. It\u2019s so intense.\u201d Concussion injuries, such a key theme across sport now, resonate with Frampton far more than they did in his youth. \u201cYou just mature and understand things a bit more.

I struggle to put my socks on in the morning. That\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t start stretching until you reach 30.\u201d If Covid and a hand injury have obscured the buildup to the Jackal\u2019s latest return, there was an added level of complexity. A lengthy court battle between Frampton and Barry McGuigan, another of Irish boxing\u2019s favourite sons, was concluded in November. McGuigan had been Frampton\u2019s long-time manager. In a recent podcast Frampton said of McGuigan and his sons that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t piss on them if they were on fire\u201d, and he insists now: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take that statement back. There was genuine trust there for a long time. I loved these people, they were groomsmen at my wedding, I was groomsman at Shane McGuigan\u2019s wedding. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute shame what happened but it is what it is. That\u2019s life, I suppose. I can laugh about it. I just don\u2019t want to have anything to do with these people anymore but it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m sitting here seething every day.

There were a lot of funny incidents. I had mates watching it via a link most days and they were really upset when the settlement happened, they had nothing else to do again.\u201d Still, Frampton in hindsight feels \u201ca weight was lifted\u201d by the case ending.

Related: Dillian Whyte: 'I was born in a storm. Adversity is the story of my life'    Frampton understandably backs away from traces of negativity. The scale of his cross-community support in Northern Ireland, for example, has had an impact beyond boxing. He smiles when recalling, aged 11, spending six weeks with a family in Texas as part of a project for working-class youngsters. \u201cPeople thought Northern Ireland was thatched roof cottages and men running about the streets with guns. That\u2019s the impression they had. \u201cThere is always a bit of tension bubbling under the surface and I don\u2019t think the politicians do us any favours. There is still a green or orange vote and we are a generation away from ruling that out. But it is a much better place than when I was a kid. And when I was growing up in Belfast, it was a much better place than when my dad was growing up in Belfast. We are getting there.\u201d Frampton has dedicated almost 30 years of his life to boxing. \u201cIf someone had told me I\u2019d win a world title then lost it in my first defence, I\u2019d have taken that.

They have a host of in-form players \u2013 such as Mislav Orsic, Bruno Petkovic and Arijan Ademi \u2013 and feel that they can go one step further than reaching the last 16 two years ago. Then they lost against Benfica but before that they had been unable to qualify for the knockout rounds for almost half a century. Not a bad turn of events for Mamic, who could have just as easily been spending this time behind bars rather than on the Dinamo bench. Or, perhaps, fleeing justice like his brother Zdravko, for many years the most powerful figure in Croatian football, who is at large in Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are not many stories about the domestic game in Croatia in foreign media that does not mention the name Mamic, especially in the past few years after a set of corruption and tax evasion charges were raised against the brothers. The subsequent trial attracted much public attention with the likes of Luka Modric and Dejan Lovren testifying in court. Modric\u2019s testimony, in particular, created headlines because it led to an indictment for perjury against the Real Madrid player and 2018 Ballon d\u2019Or winner, which was later dropped.

Photograph: Elvis Barukcic/AFP/Getty Images    In June 2018, the Osijek county court found the Mamics guilty on all charges, the cornerstone of which was making illegal personal profits on player transfers from Dinamo, where they held key executive positions \u2013 including the 2008 Modric transfer to Tottenham. The decision is only final upon appeal and after it is confirmed by the superior court but Croatian law specifies that jail terms are effective immediately for any sentence of five years or higher. Zdravko fled Croatia on the eve of the verdict which gave him six and a half years in jail and has been in Bosnia and Herzegovina since; he holds dual citizenship and the country is not obliged to extradite him. He later claimed on his Facebook page that he had been tipped off by a former football referee, who had \u201caccidentally overheard\u201d some judges discussing the verdict in his case that day. Zoran, at the time the head coach at the United Arab Emirates club Al Ain FC, was given four years and 11 months, just enough for him not to have to go to jail immediately. The courts in Croatia tend to move at a snail\u2019s pace. This year, more than 30 months after the verdict, the superior court finally held a hearing in the Mamic case. The prosecution asked for stricter punishments, while the defendants have continued to deny all charges and are asking for them to be dropped altogether. The final decision is still to be announced. Zoran has returned to Dinamo, the club insisting there was no financial damage done, suggesting Zdravko is still very much in control of the club. Besides, laying low or seeking the moral high ground was never the Mamic way. A year after being found guilty of siphoning off money from the club, Zoran was appointed Dinamo\u2019s director of football. By the end of last season, he took over as manager. Maintaining he was completely innocent, he stated his intention to concentrate on football.

Zoran has done a very good job in his second stint as Dinamo manager and that was enough to silence some of the critics. However, his bizarre position and his legal problems remain a concern. While he is waiting for the court\u2019s final decision, which could see him dismissed from the club before the end of the season \u2013 or, indeed, even before their European campaign is over \u2013 he has another set of charges to deal with.

The chancellor has promised tax rises and spending cuts. Without a radical response, increases in poverty, unemployment and inequality will be inevitable outcomes of the Covid crisis. What\u2019s needed now is a social guarantee that enshrines every person\u2019s right to life\u2019s essentials. Most people will agree what these essentials are: education, healthcare, a decent home, care, food, clean air and water, energy, transport and (these days) access to the internet. To ensure everyone has these essentials, people must have a fair living income and access to public services that meet their needs. We expect to pay for some necessities ourselves. Food is an obvious example, so everyone must have enough money to afford a nutritious diet. There are other essentials that most of us couldn\u2019t afford on our own. Think of education, healthcare, childcare and adult social care. Here, we ensure everyone has access by sharing responsibility, pooling resources and acting together. Without providing these services collectively through public institutions, we would need vast amounts of cash to meet all of our needs. Some people in policy circles have spent too long arguing whether \u201cuniversal basic income\u201d (UBI) or \u201cuniversal basic services\u201d (UBS) ought to be our preferred goal. But in fact we need both. Without public services, many people wouldn\u2019t be able to afford to pay for their healthcare or education, and without a guaranteed income floor below which nobody can fall, far too many people would be condemned to poverty.   Related: Californians on universal basic income paid off debt and got full-time jobs    It\u2019s best to think of these things as two sides of a coin. On one side, we want to make sure that everyone has a secure and sufficient income. This would minimise the humiliation of claiming benefits, and reflect the reality that peoples\u2019 income levels vary dramatically according to their different jobs, needs and conditions. This calls for generous cash payments available according to need, through a system that is open-hearted and empowering, not hostile or begrudging. On the other side of the coin are the services that are essential to live a good life, which people don\u2019t pay for directly. These are worth much more to people on low incomes, so they help to reduce inequalities. They\u2019ve been gravely undermined by a decade of austerity and will be in even greater danger if the vast costs of Covid-19 are used to justify more spending cuts. So they need defending, extending and transforming. It\u2019s not a matter of which option is preferable, but rather how each of them is realised in practice, and how they fit together and support each other. A guaranteed income floor (one version of UBI) can be combined with more and better public services to provide secure foundations for everyone to flourish. For that to work, the income floor must be set at a level that is sufficient, without absorbing public funds needed to maintain and improve services. There\u2019s no \u201cmagic bullet\u201d for solving problems such as deepening poverty, widening inequalities, rising unemployment and the threats of future pandemics and climate breakdown. But we can make a decent start if we enhance public services and integrate them with a basic income as part of a new social guarantee. This guarantee would give everyone the right to a secure and sufficient income and to the services that meet their needs, regardless of their ability to pay. It wouldn\u2019t be a top-down, uniform model. Services would be delivered through a wide range of organisations, from local councils and social enterprises to co-ops and charities. But all providers would be bound by the same set of principles and an obligation to serve the public interest. People who use services, and public service workers, would be fully involved in planning and delivering them. Meanwhile, the main role of the state would be to ensure everyone has equal access to these things, to set and enforce standards, collect and distribute funds and coordinate different services to get the best results for those who need them. This is a radical programme, but it\u2019s also a pragmatic one. It can be implemented in stages, and questions such as which services people need most and what level of income is sufficient can be worked out democratically. Most importantly, a system that integrates cash and in-kind benefits will have transformative impacts. For one thing, it\u2019s highly redistributive. It would build a sense of shared responsibility and solidarity, because everyone contributes and everyone benefits. It would generate relatively secure public-sector employment at all skill levels, and would encourage the efficient use of public resources. And because this social guarantee involves shared responsibility and collective action, rather than purely market-based transactions, it would be more able to support a concerted approach to climate action and ecological sustainability. So it\u2019s time for progressives to throw their weight behind a social guarantee that combines income and services. A post-Covid society demands this level of vision, ambition and collaborative endeavour.

The animals face a grim future as habitat loss is exacerbated by the pandemic\u2019s impact on tourism, which is pushing landowners to sell off areas for development, and a growing trend towards a sedentary lifestyle among the pastoralist Maasai people, says the new 10-year management plan. Increased and unregulated grazing in the Amboseli national park is destroying plant and animal diversity, aggravating conflicts between humans and wildlife and intensifying the negative effects of climate crisis with flooding and drought. If nothing is done urgently to secure the ecosystem, the report says, the park risks becoming an \u201cecological island\u201d, confining the 1,800 elephants that live there into a tight circle of five animals to each square kilometre as opposed to their basic survival threshold of one elephant to every square kilometre.

Photograph: Buena Vista Images/Getty Images    Amboseli includes the 39,200 hectare national park \u2013 one of the most photographed landscapes in Africa, where elephants and other wildlife are framed by the backdrop of Kilimanjaro \u2013 and seven group ranches belonging to the Maasai community that cover 506,329 hectares. It is the constant subdivision of this land into smaller parcels and their possible change of use into commercial ventures that conservationists fear will lead to loss of wildlife dispersal areas and close corridors used by animals to visit adjacent conservation areas, such as Tsavo and Kilimanjaro. \u201cIsolation of the park from the rest of the ecosystem would have adverse impacts on wildlife populations and tourism in the area. If the park is isolated, there would be less wildlife species diversity, which would necessitate a reduction of elephant numbers, while 15% biomass potential of wildlife in the ranches could be lost,\u201d says the management plan.

Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/Reuters    It is not just the elephants that face imminent danger. Four other inhabitants of Amboseli: the Maasai giraffe, lion, cheetah and hippo are on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of threatened species. Amboseli is also one of the 62 important bird areas (IBAs) in Kenya and a member of Unesco\u2019s global network of biosphere reserves. Of the 503 bird species recorded in the park, 17 are on IUCN\u2019s Red List. According to the management plan, elephants in Amboseli act to balance the larger ecosystem, boosting the survival of diverse species. For example, the elephants have traditionally used a southern corridor to connect with others on the northern slopes of Kilimanjaro. But it is closing fast as commercial farming increases, with the report warning of \u201cimminent extinction of species\u201d. \u201cConnecting Amboseli national park and Kilimanjaro forest on the Tanzanian side is a narrow strip of land, the Kitenden Corridor, which allows wildlife movement, and particularly elephant movement, between the two protected areas. The Amboseli populations may act as an important gene pool, particularly for the small population of eland in the moorland and alpine zones of Kilimanjaro, which might be prone to natural extinction if passage through the corridor is blocked,\u201d says the plan.

In February, Mwato brought together conservation officials and landowners to discuss the development of an action plan, a measure they hope will lead to the survival of the wildlife animals and improve Maasai livelihoods.   Related: Budget cuts and collapse in tourism revenue pose 'severe' threat to nature    \u201cThese people are central to the survival of the Amboseli ecosystem,\u201d Mwato told the Guardian. \u201cThey have grazed their cattle in the midst of wildlife in land that was collectively owned for decades. Now they are subdividing the land and getting individual land ownership documents. What happens next will make or break conservation.\u201d Mwato says that for local people to benefit economically from the land, a programme where specific blocks are earmarked for grazing, conservation and tourism, cultivation, human settlement and other forms of infrastructure needs to be in place. However, for some owners the money has been too tempting and they\u2019ve opted to lease their newly registered land to big commercial enterprises from outside the area.

A lone zebra stands motionless, oblivious to the whistling of a Maasai boy herding cattle into nearby lush pasture grounds. This illustrates the harmonies of life in Amboseli. On the opposite side of the road is a fenced farm \u2013 about 1,000 acres \u2013 where dozens of employees are hard at work sorting horticultural produce for the export market. Refrigerated trucks taking fresh produce from here to the airport in Nairobi, 240km away, are now more common than the tourist vehicles that used to throng the area before Covid. For local Maasai who feel they benefited little from the proceeds of tourism despite the wildlife on their land, leasing land to such businesses seems a viable option. \u201cSuch landowners feel that leasing their newly registered parcels of land to investors makes sense. For example, a person with 60 acres in a wildlife conservancy might earn 30,000 Kenyan shillings (\u00a3200) a year in lease fees. In the current situation where there is only a trickle of tourists due to coronavirus, even that amount may not be guaranteed. But in comparison, leasing out the land for commercial farming brings the same amount of money per acre. That is why some will opt to lease out their land for such activities,\u201d says Mwato.     A Maasai herder lets his cattle graze alongside a large herd of wildebeest. Photograph: AfriPics.com/Alamy    Still, conservationists feel that if land subdivision is handled well, it can breathe some life into the endangered ecosystem. Evan Mkala, the International Fund for Animal Welfare\u2019s (IFAW) programme manager for the region says: \u201cThe Maasai have always opened up their land to wildlife despite the amorphous group ranch arrangement. With direct ownership of the land, they have legal authority to set up wildlife conservancies, create proper governance structures and lay the groundwork for community infrastructure development.\u201d Since 2010, IFAW has been signing land lease agreements with pastoralists to safeguard a wildlife corridor between Amboseli and Kilimanjaro. Mwato and his team at Amboseli Ecosystem Trust hope that more landowners will embrace the conservancy model and save the fragile ecosystem. \u201cNo tourism investor will come when all the space for wildlife has been converted to agriculture,\u201d says Mwato. But what if more of Amboseli is turned over to agriculture? \u201cWe can say goodbye to conservation. We will have to describe how an elephant used to look to our future generations.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "The Code Breaker by Walter Isaacson review \u2013 a science page-turner ", "full_article": "One of the most striking passages in Walter Isaacson\u2019s new book comes towards the end. It is 2019 and a scientific meeting is under way at the famous Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in New York State, but James Watson, the co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, is banned from it because of the racist and scientifically unfounded views he has expressed on intelligence. Isaacson, who is to interview Watson, therefore has to make his way to the house on the nearby campus that the scientist has been allowed to keep. When the conversation sails dangerously close to the race issue, someone shouts from the kitchen: \u201cIf you are going to let him say these things, then I am going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d The 91-year-old Watson shrugs and changes tack. The voice from the kitchen belonged to Rufus, Watson\u2019s middle-aged son who suffers from schizophrenia. \u201cMy dad\u2019s statements might make him out to be a bigot and discriminatory,\u201d he once said. \u201cThey just represent his rather narrow interpretation of genetic destiny.\u201d In many ways, Isaacson observes, Rufus is wiser than his father. Genetic destiny is a central theme of The Code Breaker, Isaacson\u2019s portrait of the gene-editing pioneer Jennifer Doudna, who, with a small army of other scientists, handed humanity the first really effective tools to shape it. Rufus Watson\u2019s reflections encapsulate the ambivalence that many people feel about this. If we had the power to rid future generations of diseases such as schizophrenia, would we? The immoral choice would be not to, surely? What if we could enhance healthy human beings, by editing out imperfections? The nagging worry \u2013 which might one day seem laughably luddite, even cruel \u2013 is that we would lose something along with those diseases and imperfections, in terms of wisdom, compassion and, in some way that is harder to define, humanity.     Emmanuelle Charpentier, who shared the Nobel prize in chemistry with Doudna. Photograph: Peter Steffen/AP    Doudna contributed to the identification of Crispr, a system that evolved in bacteria over billions of years to fend off invading viruses. Crispr-Cas9, to give it its proper name, disarms viruses by slicing up their DNA. Bacteria invented it, but the insight that won Doudna \u2013 a biochemist at the University of California, Berkeley \u2013 the Nobel prize in chemistry last year, along with French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier, was that it could be adapted to edit genes in other organisms, including humans. The paper that sealed the duo\u2019s fame was published in 2012, when Charpentier was working at Ume\u00e5 University in Sweden. By the beginning of 2020, two dozen human trials were under way for medical applications of the technique \u2013 for conditions from cancers to atherosclerosis to a congenital form of blindness. The Crispr story is made for the movies. It features a nail-biting race, more than its fair share of renegades, the highest prize in chemistry, a gigantic battle over patents, designer babies and acres of ethical quicksand. It presents a challenge to a biographer, however, who has to pick one character from a cast of many to carry that story. Isaacson chose Doudna, and you can understand why. Having helped to elucidate the basic science of Crispr, she remains implicated in its clinical applications and in the ethical debate it stimulated \u2013 unlike Charpentier, who has said that she doesn\u2019t want to be defined by Crispr and is now pursuing other science questions. Doudna is the thread that holds the story together. Still, you can\u2019t help wondering how that story might have read if it had been told from the point of view of Francisco Mojica, the Spanish scientist who first spotted Crispr in bacteria inhabiting salt ponds in the 1990s. He intuited that it did something important, then doggedly pursued this line of research despite a lack of funding and the fact that everyone told him he was wasting his time. A different story again might have been told via the two French food scientists who realised in 2007 that Crispr could be harnessed to vaccinate bacteria against viruses, thus securing the future of the global yoghurt industry, or the Lithuanian biochemist Virginijus \u0160ik\u0161nys, who moved the story on again, but whose work was rejected by top journals. Each one made an essential contribution, and it\u2019s difficult to say whose, if any, was the most important. A similar dilemma preoccupied Carl Djerassi and Roald Hoffmann in their 2001 play Oxygen, which asked who should receive a \u201cRetro-Nobel\u201d for the discovery of the eponymous gas. Should it go to the scientist who discovered oxygen but didn\u2019t publish his discovery, the one who published but failed to understand the discovery\u2019s significance, or the one who grasped its significance but only thanks to the insights of the other two? Focusing on Doudna also paints the Crispr story as more American than it was. Doudna herself acknowledged its international dimension, in her own account, A Crack in Creation (2017). \u201cAll told, we would be quite the international group,\u201d she wrote of the team that produced the seminal 2012 paper, \u201ca French professor in Sweden, a Polish student in Austria, a German student, a Czech postdoc, and an American professor in Berkeley\u201d. The fact that her Czech postdoc and Charpentier\u2019s Polish student had grown up close to each other \u2013 either side of a border \u2013 and that both spoke Polish, reinforced the group\u2019s synergy and sped the writing of the paper.    Isaacson understands the tensions that drive discovery and how flawed brilliant people can be    It was precisely because so many people contributed, and because they disagree about the significance and primacy of their contributions, that they remain entangled in a row over ownership. The Crispr revolution owes a great deal to America and the premium it places on creativity and innovation, but as with so many scientific breakthroughs, there was an element of convergence \u2013 of people independently and more-or-less simultaneously arriving at the same insight. (Isaacson suggests radar and the atomic bomb were American inventions too, but radar was developed in many countries in the run-up to the second world war, while European refugees from that war helped build the bomb.) It\u2019s not only the discovery process that is collective. As soon as a discovery is made public an even wider circle of people will apply it, and they may not have the same priorities. It\u2019s easy and right to condemn Chinese maverick He Jiankui for editing the genes of twins Lulu and Nana, supposedly to protect them from HIV infection, but in his impassioned reply to Doudna\u2019s criticism of his act there seems buried a grain of truth. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand China,\u201d he told her. \u201cThere\u2019s an incredible stigma about being HIV positive, and I wanted to give these people a chance at a normal life ...\u201d Genetic destiny means different things to different people, as Rufus Watson understands. Isaacson, who is best known for his lives of Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci, remains a consummate portraitist. He captures the frontier spirit of Harvard geneticist George Church in an anecdote about how, when Church was a child, his physician stepfather let him administer hormone injections to his female patients (Church has been testing experimental Covid-19 vaccines on himself lately). Isaacson also has a privileged vantage point, knowing the Crispr backstory and the personalities that shaped it. In 2000, as editor of Time, he put the two men leading competing efforts to sequence the human genome \u2013 Francis Collins and Craig Venter \u2013 on the cover. He understands the tensions that drive discovery and how flawed brilliant people can be. This story was always guaranteed to be a page-turner in his hands. It\u2019s just that science has outgrown biography as a medium. His subject should have been Crispr, not Doudna. \u2022 The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna, Gene Editing, and the Future of the Human Race is published by Simon &amp; Schuster (\u00a330).

This is how things stand:  The Australian government does not have an exact date for when all Australians will be vaccinated against Covid-19 and has conceded it will not meet its initial target vaccinating 4m people by the start of April. Health department secretary Prof Brendan Murphy said the main target, of vaccinating all adult Australians by the end of October, remained on track, but said that only meant ensuring everyone had their first dose by the end of October. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese earlier criticised the Australian government for its slow start to the vaccine rollout. The plan was to vaccinate 4 million by the end of March; we\u2019re currently on 100,000. A nursing home resident in Victoria has returned a weak positive test for Covid-19. The person had previously contracted the virus and health authorities said the result was likely due to viral shedding not a re-infection. The federal government announced a $1.2bn tourism industry support package, which includes half-price flights to 12 destinations. But the plan has been criticised by Labor, who say it appears to target marginal seats; the tourism industry, who say it \u201cwon\u2019t save many jobs at all\u201d and leaves Melbourne and Sydney for dead; unions, who say it won\u2019t replace jobkeeper as a mechanism to save jobs; and the Queensland government, which, despite featuring heavily on the half-price destination list, hasn\u2019t dropped its demand for jobkeeper to be extended, and says it won\u2019t guarantee it will keep its border open. The Victorian government will announce an inquiry into the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the tourism and event sector. State tourism minister Martin Pakula said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d to see just one Victorian destination on the federal government\u2019s tourism list.  South Australia continues to find Covid-19 fragments in the wastewater from Adelaide CBD. Anyone with symptoms, however mild, who has been to the area is advised to get tested.

The National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (Natsils) met today with representatives of 15 families who have had a loved one die in custody, and who are demanding a meeting with prime minister Scott Morrison. It said:  We are horrified and deeply upset that there have been three Black deaths in custody in the past week. Our thoughts are with their families and loved ones at this incredibly difficult time.  On April 15, it will have been 30 years since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We are extremely concerned that while our people continue to die in custody at alarming rates, Federal, state and territory governments have had the answers to end this injustice for 30 years but have chosen not to act. Governments have chosen not to prioritise saving Black lives.  30 years on from the Royal Commission, we call on governments to go beyond the empty gestures of the past, and to make sure that the legacy of every single person who has died in custody is honoured by ending this injustice for good. Our people have marched, we have raised our voices, we have participated in inquiry after inquiry, we have shared our stories and developed solutions. And yet governments are standing by while Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are dying under their watch, in their prisons, police cells and during police pursuits.   They added:   Our thoughts are with the family of Nathan Reynolds, whose coronial findings handed down today found that his death was contributed to by deficiencies in management and inadequate emergency responses from Corrective Services.

Surely 1996 was only 15 years ago?? What is time??    Updated at 6.29am GMT     6.09am GMT       Some more details have emerged about the Australian government\u2019s opposition to a World Trade Organisation push to allow developing countries to manufacture and import cheap copies of licensed Covid-19 vaccines.  Ahead of a key WTO meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, the Guardian revealed that international aid groups, health organisations and unions have been pleading with the government to support the waiver proposal, which would suspend Covid vaccine patents for successful jab formulas invented by pharmaceutical giants for the duration of the pandemic. More than 85 poor countries are not predicted to achieve widespread vaccination rollout before 2023, if at all, because of licensing rules and distribution limits that the World Health Organisation director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has labelled a \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d. Tedros, writing in the Guardian, has also warned that the longer Covid-19 circulates and mutates in developing nations, the greater the chance more deadly and vaccine-resistant variants emerge that could stifle immunity in wealthy, well-vaccinated countries. The proposal to waive the required 20-year patent right for medicines under the WTO\u2019s agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights had the backing of 100 mostly low- and middle-income countries but pharmaceutical companies and governments in the US, UK and Europe are understood to be strongly opposed to the waiver.  Australia was part of a last-minute attempt, along with New Zealand and Canada, which urged the WTO to help individual countries negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. Australia\u2019s position still supported forcing the poorer countries and those manufacturing the generic vaccines to pay for rights to formulas.  However, Reuters has reported that the waiver proposal was ultimately opposed by Britain, Switzerland, EU nations and the US \u2013 in part the result of the WTO\u2019s consensus-based system, as opposed to a majority voting system. Dr Patricia Ranald, convener of the Australian Fair Trade and Investment Network, which urged the government to support the waiver earlier this week, told the Guardian:  It is remarkable in a forum like this when we\u2019re talking about medicines and vaccine that will save peoples\u2019 lives that six or eight countries can block it for them.   On Wednesday, the trade minister, Dan Tehan, when asked about Australia\u2019s position, said:  We\u2019ve got to make sure that there are some protections in place for the millions of dollars that has gone into the research to create these vaccines.

AAP reports that the fire, which was lit by forestry authorities on Saturday following logging operations, has been burning out of control since Wednesday in gusty winds. Emergency services have issued a smoke and ash warning for people in the area around New Norfolk, Bushy Park, Westerway and Gretna. The fire has burnt 130ha of forest and is within 4km of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area. Firefighting crews, bulldozers and helicopters are trying to contain the blaze before Friday, when winds are predicted to increase and the temperature is tipped to reach 27C. Former Greens senator Dr Bob Brown has described the planned burns as \u201cinstitutionalised vandalism\u201d. He said:  They drop napalm-like material from helicopters to create a firestorm.  Brown has called for a police investigation into the blaze.  If a tourist operator was responsible for this fire they would lose their licence.  Sustainable Timber Tasmania manager Dean Sheehan said new containment lines had been cut and crews were working to bring the fire under control.

On Wednesday the ACT government sent lawyers to the bail hearing of a 37-year-old Indigenous woman, who alleges she was forcibly strip-searched by guards in full riot gear in the territory\u2019s jail, the Alexander Maconochie centre, this year. The government\u2019s lawyers successfully argued to have footage of the strip-searching kept from public view, saying it may cause reprisal attacks on the guards. The woman, meanwhile, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly as a result of the ordeal. She has a serious heart condition, of which prison authorities were forewarned, and was stripped in front of male detainees, despite being a sexual assault survivor.

Sydney sailed this morning with a full crew.  In accordance with Department of Health guidelines, members of the ship\u2019s company were encouraged to report to medical personnel if they were feeling unwell after their vaccination.

More from AAP: The committee is charged with developing options and giving independent advice in what the government says is a vital role on its path to a treaty. The state has also committed to a \u201ctruth telling and healing\u201d process, the importance of which was underscored by the minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander partnerships, Craig Crawford. He said:  We shouldn\u2019t underestimate how important the truth-telling part of this journey will be to healing the wounds that have accrued over 250 years of recent history. Children who were stolen were stripped of their connection to family, land, culture and language. Taken to homes and institutions, many suffered abuse and neglect. There can be no greater suffering for a parent than the loss of a child.  The Treaty Advancement Committee is co-chaired by Bidjara/Birri Gubba Juru woman Jackie Huggins and Ghungalu man Mick Gooda. The other members are Michael Lavarch, Josephine Bourne and Sallyanne Atkinson. Crawford said:   I particularly want to acknowledge Dr Huggins and Mr Gooda, both of whom are well known for their commitment and advocacy for the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people over many years. The committee held its first meeting this week and will play a vital role in continuing the momentum of our Path to Treaty process.     Updated at 5.06am GMT     4.54am GMT    Labor attacks Bronnie Taylor over grant    The grasslands saga just refuses to die for the Taylor family. A $107,000 grant to Monaro Farming Systems \u2013 a company which is linked to Federal MP Angus Taylor\u2019s brother, Richard \u2013 has prompted a sharp exchange in NSW estimates as another Taylor \u2013 upper house MP Bronnie Taylor \u2013 faced questions about whether she had any involvement in securing the money.  Guardian Australia reported a fortnight ago that NSW Local Land Services\u2019 head office had awarded the grant to Monaro Farming Systems without the farming co-operative actually having applied for it. The work done using the grant was then used to lobby for a change in federal and state laws protecting native grasslands. At the time a company, Jam Land, in which Richard, Angus and Bronnie have links, was facing prosecution for illegal clearing of the critically endangered ecological community. An outraged Bronnie Taylor accused Labor\u2019s environment spokeswoman, Penny Sharpe, of seeking to \u201cslur and sully my family\u201d. Labor had been attacking her since the day she arrived in parliament, she said, including using nicknames such as Hyacinth Bouquet, a reference to the main character in the BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances. But answers about her involvement, if any, in the grant weren\u2019t forthcoming.  Taylor revealed that because her brother-in-law Richard was a member of Monaro Farming Systems, all family members were entitled to take part as members.  This potentially gives her a pecuniary interest in MFS, though she insisted she had properly declared all her interests on the register. Taylor said:  They are an eminent farming body covering 70% of landowners on the Monaro.  But as for Sharpe\u2019s central question of whether Taylor had lobbied any current and former ministers for the grant, we are none the wiser. A visibly angry Taylor told Sharpe several times that the question was \u201cdisrespectful of her family\u201d and invited her to instead ask her questions about her portfolio .     Bronnie Taylor.

Not only are they planning to use untested assessment tools and strangers to assess extremely complex people in a very short period of time, they\u2019re also planning to fundamentally alter the way that the NDIS was intended to work. The NDIS was always intended to consider our lives and needs rather than just our impairments \u2013 the changes they want to bring in are designed to reduce supports and remove funding from a group of people who are already living in crisis.  People with Disabilities Australia is one of 20 disability sector organizations which wrote to government in opposition to the plan.  Connor said it often took people a long time to get a medical team which understands their needs. One PWDA member said in response to a survey in October:  I have multiple disabilities and chronic health conditions,\u201d said one member in a survey response. It has taken a long time to curate a medical team who understand me and who work with me in the way I need\u2026my conditions fluctuate and this cannot be judged appropriately with one observation session. I am fearful of strangers making decisions about my livelihood without understanding my history and personal challenges.  Minister Stuart Robert earlier defended the change because it had been recommended by the Productivity Commission, saying the government had previously been criticised for not doing exactly what the Productivity Commission said in relation to the NDIS.

Senator Mehreen Faruqi said:  This is a matter of global justice, and putting people before the profits of enormous pharmaceutical companies. The Covid-19 vaccine is a public good, not a commodity, and access to healthcare is a human right. It would be unconscionable \u2013 and highly self-defeating \u2013 for Australia to allow the Covid-19 pandemic to roll on in the Global South all to the benefit of big pharma. All the Global South countries are asking for is to be given access to intellectual property allowing for research, manufacture and supply of vaccines without risking a trade dispute. Refusing this will allow pharmaceutical giants to shake down nations that are already struggling under huge debt burdens and the legacy of colonialism. If they can\u2019t pay or take on more debt, then Australia has condemned them to years of lockdowns, social injustice, sickness and death.     Updated at 4.16am GMT     3.59am GMT       The former Liberal leader John Hewson has added his voice to calls for the government to abandon a controversial plan to introduce independent assessments to the NDIS.  This morning we reported on the concerns of a coalition of 20 disability organisations that fear the change is aimed at cutting costs.  The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, responded today that the government has no intention to halt the roll out of the mandatory assessments, which are slated to begin in the middle of the year.  But Hewson says the government should \u201crethink\u201d the reform.     Govt should rethink plan to have independent assessments of disabled.

Kirkup, you\u2019ll recall, addressed the media a short time ago about the Liberal party costings and it was ... not the clearest press conference. One thing that was clear was that some of the Liberal party\u2019s stated priorities, like providing immediate support to small business, weren\u2019t costed. Wyatt said:  I think what that performance shows is that the inexperience and risk of the Liberal party was on full display. There have been very few press conferences that would confirm that so much. And I say to any West Australian, I invite you to watch that press conference with the shadow treasurer and the leader of the opposition and David Honey, the shadow minister \u2013 see for yourself.  This party is not worth the risk and this is the party that is saying to West Australians: give us the power veto over any future government. I think anyone watching that would be very unlikely to want these guys in charge of any part of the parliament.  The WA election is on Saturday.

Updated at 3.51am GMT     3.39am GMT    October deadline for vaccinating all Australians refers to first dose only, Brendan Murphy says    Labor senators are probing health department officials about Scott Morrison, Greg Hunt and the government\u2019s commitment that Australian adults would be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d by October. In fact, health department secretary Brendan Murphy\u2019s evidence today is that every adult will have received the first dose of AstraZeneca, but maybe not everyone will have had the second dose. Is that a contradiction? Murphy:  I said vaccinated by the end of October because every Australian adult will be offered a vaccine by the end of October. If a small number haven\u2019t had their second AstraZeneca, that doesn\u2019t really matter, they are fully protected by the first dose. It is entirely consistent with what the prime minister and minister have said in the media.  Asked if \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d meant two doses, Murphy replied:  ... to complete the program [yes], but in terms of protection the first dose is fully protective. There is full population coverage in terms of offering a vaccine. It\u2019s a semantic debate.  The original October deadline was set when the best advice was that AstraZeneca doses should be given four weeks apart, but the advice changed that a 12-week gap makes it most effective. Caroline Edwards, from the health department, said the government was still aiming to vaccinate everyone by the end of October. She said:  We are still planning and hoping to have both shots by the end of October. In the event that we didn\u2019t get all shots by the end of October, the second shot would be finished six weeks after the end of October.  Which would put us in December.

At a hearing into national security risks in the education sector, Mike Burgess said Asio had had about 60 interactions with universities last year. That included universities reaching out to Asio to seek advice. Burgess told the intelligence committee the prime minister\u2019s department and home affairs were currently working on ways to explain the types of research that required additional risk management.  The starting point for that would be us being clear about what is sensitive and what is not, and I would acknowledge there is some ambiguity there at this stage which is unhelpful to researchers, students and research organisations.  A committee member asked how many countries Asio was concerned about, in regard to the targeting of tertiary and research organisations and attempts to secure intellectual property. The spy chief replied:  I generally don\u2019t like giving numbers but it\u2019s way more than one but it\u2019s less than 10, in terms of countries we currently worry about, but that can change.        3.26am GMT       Victorian tourism minister Martin Pakula  says he\u2019s disappointed by the federal government\u2019s half-price flight initiative, which does not cover most of the state.

For example, Avalon airport, near Geelong, is in Corangamite, held by Labor\u2019s Libby Coker on a margin of just over 1%.    Updated at 3.36am GMT     3.13am GMT       Western Australian opposition leader Zak Kirkup  is talking to reporters in Perth about the costings for the Liberal party policies. In case you missed it earlier, Kirkup, who already said he does not think his party will win, last night said he would likely quit politics if he loses his seat of Dawesville.  Given there are just 300 votes between him and defeat, and there\u2019s a swing on toward Labor, it\u2019s not an empty threat. This costing presentation ... is not going well. For example, Kirkup said small business needed immediate assistance, but there\u2019s nothing in the Liberal party policy book on that beyond providing payroll tax relief. Kirkup said:  We\u2019ve asked the government time and time again to provide for assistance for our small and family businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown. At this point in time, the government has shown no appetite for that. We continue to call on them to do that.  So, the Liberal party is offering zero immediate support for small businesses?  At this point in time we\u2019ve called on the government to provide that assistance. We haven\u2019t called on them to provide anything other than important payroll tax and the like. Calling on the government is an important part to make sure they respond to help those small businesses who\u2019ve been affected by the lockdown.  A reporter asks what was the point of the costing exercise, given Kirkup has already conceded the election.  He replies:  I think it is important to provide the people of Western Australia an understanding that Liberal party plans are costed and considered for the long-term future. This is exactly what we\u2019d like the Labor party to take onboard. Let\u2019s use our plan for recruiting 1,200 new places in Western Australia.  If the Labor party took that on, we would happily support that and do whatever we can. If the Labor party doesn\u2019t want to take that on, what we\u2019re saying to the people of Australia is we\u2019ll support and fight to get 1,200 new places recruited in Western Australia to help keep people safe.     Updated at 3.38am GMT     3.05am GMT       Addressing national security risks at universities \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to come at the expense of academic freedom\u201d, the head of Australian spy agency Asio has told an inquiry. Mike Burgess, the director general of security, is addressing the intelligence committee this afternoon. He said Australia was currently facing a heightened threat of foreign interference and espionage. Burgess said China\u2019s Thousand Talents plan - an academic recruitment program - was not, in and of itself, concerning. He said Asio\u2019s focus was where a foreign government used clandestine means to obtain Australian research.  It is the intent and character of the activity that matters.  Burgess said most people had a good understanding of was espionage involved, but foreign interference was \u201cless well understood\u201d. Foreign interference was different from foreign influence. On the latter point, he said all states sought to influence \u2013 and that was acceptable when it was done openly and transparently. Burgess said foreign interference involved clandestine or deceptive actions conducted on behalf of foreign power to affect political process or that was otherwise detrimental to Australia\u2019s interests. He said Asio was aware of foreign intelligence services and their proxies seeking to develop relationships with academics. In some cases, he said, foreign interference could extend to the threat of physical harm. He said Asio would be concerned \u201cif a foreign government is active behind the scenes trying to covertly shut down\u201d free speech in Australia, in reference to protests. Burgess was asked whether the threat was overwhelmingly from one country. He said:   I would characterise it as more than one country. One country in particular is highly active but they are not alone in that endeavour.     Updated at 3.16am GMT     2.59am GMT       Labor has called on the federal government to extend Medicare provisions for telehealth, which were introduced at the start of the pandemic last year. Health minister Greg Hunt said in November that telehealth would become \u201ca permanent part of the Medicare system,\u201d but Labor\u2019s health spokesman, Mark Butler, said those arrangements will end on 31 March, with no formal announcement, at this stage, about their extension.  Telehealth has played a critically important role in managing Australians\u2019 physical and mental health during the pandemic \u2013 especially for those in regional and remote communities. Scott Morrison as acting health minister must urgently extend the telehealth measures.  The Australian Medical Association is also calling for the extension, with president Dr Omar Khorshid saying:  The current uncertainty over the future of temporary Covid-19 Medicare telehealth items means that patients and practices can\u2019t plan consultations beyond the end of this month, even though we are still in the middle of the pandemic.  Khorshid said ending the temporary arrangements in three weeks would be \u201cpremature\u201d.     Updated at 3.03am GMT     2.46am GMT    Class action launched over Cudlee Creek bushfire    A class action seeking an estimated $150 million in damages has been launched on behalf of hundreds of victims of the bushfire that raged through the Adelaide Hills in December 2019. AAP reports that the class action was filed in the South Australian supreme court on Monday by Maddens lawyers.  It will argue that power company SA Power Networks should have done more to ensure its protection devices responded immediately to any faults on its network. Senior counsel Brendan Pendergast said the claim argues the company should have ensured those devices, which could de-energize a powerline brought down by a falling tree, to their most sensitive settings. \u201cThey had the ability and the capacity to do that and one wonders if you don\u2019t make that adjustment on the fourth successive catastrophic bushfire day in the Adelaide Hills, when do you instigate that capacity,\u201d he said. The 23,000-hectare blaze, which destroyed almost 100 homes and damaged hundreds of other buildings and vehicles, also claimed one life with the body of a man found in his burnt-out home in the small town of Charleston. Known as the Cudlee Creek fire, it was sparked when a large pine tree fell on high-voltage conductors. One of the live conductors then came into contact with a wire fence and the ground, igniting the blaze. A state government investigation found the tree was beyond the prescribed clearance zone and that its failure could not have been identified before the event. Pendergast said his firm had made contact with about 50 victims, but with the claim operating on an \u201copt out\u201d basis it could involve up to 1000 people. He said there was broad-based community support for the class action and he believed the case was a strong one. Lead plaintiff Kris Thrower, who lost his house and most of his possessions, said the fire changed his life and the life of his family forever. \u201cI worked so hard to establish myself and now I\u2019ve stepped back all the way to zero with absolutely nothing,\u201d he said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cIt still gives me nightmares. I\u2019d like to think that someone is held accountable for the devastation to my life, my family\u2019s life, the environment around us and all the animals that perished. \u201cMentally, I\u2019m anxious. I used to be one of the calmest people I know, now every day I\u2019m looking on the horizon for a fire. \u201cIt changes you. My life has been flipped upside down and I personally don\u2019t have any closure on it.\u201d In a statement to AAP, SA Power Networks said while it had not yet seen the detail of the claim, it would defend its actions. \u201cAn independent government report concluded the fire start was due to a tree falling from outside the clearance zone and that SA Power Networks had acted in accord with its bushfire and vegetation management procedures and equipment settings,\u201d the company said.        2.32am GMT    Health department does not have an 'exact date' for all Australians being vaccinated    The chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has revealed he is notified of \u201cserious\u201d adverse events related to the vaccine, but it\u2019s so far so good. He said:  There have been a few cases of anaphylaxis. There have been some deaths following immunisation but not related to immunisation. [But] nothing unusual. The majority have been those consistent with clinical trial and real world data ... We\u2019ve seen three cases of severe allergic reactions, but they were handled expertly and quickly, with no ongoing adverse effects.  Other adverse events are relatively minor and include pain at the injection site, some fever, body pain, headache, Kelly said, but \u201cnothing untoward\u201d. Brendan Murphy said the first major \u201cclinical milestone\u201d will be when phases 1A and 1B are complete, when all \u201cvulnerable Australians\u201d are vaccinated. But health department officials can\u2019t say when 4m Australians will be vaccinated, after Murphy signalled it will miss the original end-of-March timeline Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher asks whether the October timeline means everyone will have had one or both of the AstraZeneca doses \u2013 which are ideally spaced 12 weeks apart \u2013 by that date. Murphy said the October timeline is to have delivered the first dose, which is already \u201cvery effective\u201d by itself. As Gallagher notes, this contradicts the department of prime minister and cabinet secretary Phil Gaetjens\u2019 evidence that the target relates to people having both doses. Murphy said this will be difficult. Murphy said:  We haven\u2019t got an exact date. We\u2019re remodelling.        2.28am GMT       Australia would have to be \u201cmore than certain\u201d before naming any particular country as responsible for a cyber attack, officials have told a parliamentary inquiry into higher education security risks. Earlier today there was a discussion about hack on the Australian National University in 2018, and officials had said the government had not made a determination about who was responsible for that sophisticated attack. The chair of the intelligence committee, James Paterson, returned to the topic before the lunch break, pointing officials to a 2019 media report that cited unnamed sources as saying China was the key suspect. Marc Ablong, a deputy secretary at the Department of Home Affairs with responsibility for national resilience and cyber security, cautioned that just because it was reported in the newspaper, it did not mean it reflected an official judgment. He said the government \u201chaven\u2019t made a judgment about that yet, and nor will we\u201d. Regarding attribution, Ablong said that \u201cto the degree that we can legally prove in an evidentiary sense that it is a particular organisation is a very big challenge\u201d. Paterson asked to what degree a legal level of proof was required in such cases, adding:  I\u2019m not too concerned about the human rights of the state actors accused of these kinds of cyber attacks.  Ablong replied:   You have to be more than reasonably sure. It\u2019s not a balance of probability effort \u2013 you need to be more than certain that you know who the actor is before you name them.  Ablong noted there were \u201cconsequences\u201d for naming, not just for the country that was publicly named but also for the country that made such an attribution publicly. He said there were \u201cso many tools to obfuscate where you are and what you are doing\u201d that efforts to attribute cyber intrusions \u201ccan only get so far\u201d.       2.28am GMT       Western Australia has recorded one new case of Covid-19 in hotel quarantine, and none in the community. The new case is a woman in her 40s. Authorities in WA also vaccinated 2,071 people yesterday, bringing the total number of people in the state to get their first dose to 13,498.       2.22am GMT    Prof Brendan Murphy: Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are 'equally efficacious'    The health department secretary, Brendan Murphy, has begun his evidence to the Covid committee with a full-throated defence of Australia\u2019s vaccine policy. Murphy said:  A point I would like to make: the real world data from the UK, which has widespread experience with both vaccines [Pfizer and AstraZeneca] is that both are equally efficacious. There is no difference between their efficacy. Both are incredibly effective at prevent severe Covid, hospitalisation and death. I would like to publicly say the unfortunate narrative that one vaccine is a little bit better is now dead: we have two good vaccines. They are interchangeable, both work in elderly and other age groups. Both have a greater efficacy than the annual flu vaccine.  Murphy notes that from late March Australia will have its own domestically produced supply of 1m doses per week of AstraZeneca.

Updated at 2.29am GMT     2.20am GMT       A New Zealand minister has backtracked on comments he made this morning about Australia deporting New Zealand citizens convicted of criminal offences, saying Australia was \u201cexporting its garbage\u201d to New Zealand. NZ\u2019s Covid-19 response minister, Chris Hipkins, made the comments on his way into parliament this morning, saying:  This is Australia exporting its garbage to New Zealand. Their criminal offending has been in Australia ... many of them have lived the vast bulk of their lives in Australia. This is a deplorable move by the Australian government which we completely disagree with. However, having said that, they are entitled to do it.  Hipkins did not start the metaphor of referring to deported New Zealand citizens as trash \u2014 that was Australia\u2019s own Peter Dutton. Are you surprised? No, me neither. Dutton described a planeload of deportees sent to New Zealand as \u201ctrash\u201d.  Hipkins said his comments were intended as a criticism of Dutton\u2019s language, not the New Zealand citizens themselves. But he quickly apologised, saying he realised it sounded like he agreed with Dutton. He told NewsHub:  I am just reflecting that question that I was asked. If that is Peter Dutton\u2019s view of it, then he is exporting his rubbish to New Zealand ... I didn\u2019t mean to suggest that that is what I am calling them. Those are Peter Dutton\u2019s words, not my words. Those are not my words; those are Peter Dutton\u2019s words. If he is describing them that way, then he is saying Australia is deporting its rubbish to New Zealand.     Updated at 2.29am GMT     2.11am GMT    Flight Centre boss: tourism package won't 'save many jobs at all'    Some more details are beginning to emerge about how Australians can buy the half-price flights announced by the government. Graham Turner, the Flight Centre founder and chief executive, has told Guardian Australia that airlines have indicated to him that they intend to distribute the flights among travel agents, and won\u2019t require bookings to be made directly on their websites. However, speaking more broadly about the package, Turner said that the regional focus of the initiative meant it would only have \u201ca fairly small positive impact on tourism\u201d.  He said he doesn\u2019t believe the package will \u201csave many jobs at all\u201d after the jobkeeper cut-off at the end of the month, noting that Flight Centre has already lost 70% of its Australian staff since the beginning of the pandemic. Turner said the key to the industry\u2019s strength would be state borders remaining open, but he also called on the government to reopen international borders by July when older and vulnerable Australians are vaccinated.

Jobkeeper was a result of discussions with unions and has been keeping aviation workers afloat, the ACTU said. The new tourism package is the result of the Morrison government talking directly to the heads of Qantas. ACTU secretary Sally McManus said:  The Morrison government has returned to trickle-down economics, where there are no protections or guarantees for jobs \u2013 just hope employers will do the right thing. Almost 90 per cent of aviation workers\u2019 jobs are still affected by the pandemic. We should keep the jobkeeper scheme that has worked very well for the past year and has proven fit-for-purpose. It is the most successful job-saving scheme in our country\u2019s history. This package will not help workers, it contains no obligation on employers to keep workers employed, it won\u2019t even be seen by them. This package will just line the pockets of employers, who\u2019ve proven that they can\u2019t be trusted to use taxpayers\u2019 money to support their employees. Domestic travel is poised to make a comeback. It would give certainty and security to workers, if the Morrison government implemented a full-scale continuation of jobkeeper for industries and sectors where it is still needed, rather than throwing money at some of the best-paid executives in the world.     Updated at 2.10am GMT     1.59am GMT       As 20 disability groups hold a briefing for MPs on a controversial plan to introduce \u201cindependent assessments\u201d to the NDIS, the minister, Stuart Robert, has been spruiking the changes in Tasmania.  Robert released data on Thursday showing there were significant discrepancies between the average plan packages by electorate. The government argues the assessments will create more consistent outcomes.  Currently, people submit reports gathered from their specialists, but under the new policy, applicants will undergo a three-hour assessment from an allied health professional they don\u2019t know, contracted by the government. Critics fear the assessments will not accurately capture a person\u2019s disability, and are aimed at cutting costs. The disability groups on Thursday called for the rollout of the assessments \u2013 due to start mid-year \u2013 to be halted. Robert said there was no plan to do that on Thursday:  Not at all, because it\u2019s recommended by the Productivity Commission. Everyone welcomed the scheme when it was rolled out in 2013 [but] saying no, we need to build what the Productivity Commission recommended. That included the independent assessments. And as we have now got to the full scheme, now is the time to do the last piece of the build. We\u2019re now on the second trial of independent assessments, the first one starting in 2018. We\u2019ll continue to engage strongly with the sector, as we have all the time.

In findings handed down today, coroner Elizabeth Ryan said:  The delay deprived Nathan of at least some chance of surviving his acute asthma attack. These failures were due both to numerous system deficiencies and to individual errors of judgement.

The Australia Institute has slammed the federal government\u2019s announcement of support for the tourism sector, accusing the government of being \u201ceconomically reckless\u201d with the recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Matt Grundoff, a senior economist at the Australia Institute, said:  The government\u2019s announced support for the tourism sector will not come close to filling the gap caused by the end of jobkeeper. While jobkeeper is currently being paid at about $5 billion per month, the tourism package is a mere $1.2 billion over 6 months, or $200 million per month. This reduction in government stimulus means less demand and fewer jobs than would otherwise be the case if the government had not withdrawn jobkeeper.  The end of jobkeeper will see more people lose their jobs at a time when the economic recovery is just beginning. Worse, these newly unemployed people will be forced on to unemployment payments at the same time that the government has cut jobseeker by $100 per fortnight.  The government is being economically reckless with the recovery. Economic recoveries are fragile and withdrawing stimulus too early can see a vicious cycle occur where less demand in the economy leads to growing unemployment, in turn fuelling further reductions in demand and employment. The government needs to be certain about the continuation of the recovery before considering the withdrawal of jobkeeper stimulus.     Updated at 1.55am GMT     1.30am GMT       You know what?

The far north Queensland facility declared its first code yellow in more than 18 months on Wednesday after a small influx of infected people arrived from Papua New Guinea but D\u2019Ath dismissed concerns, saying this simply allows authorities to move resources around to meet high demand. She spoke today about the hospital in parliament:  The declaration of a code yellow is not something the community needs to be alarmed about. In the last week, a number of metro north hospitals experienced brief periods on code yellow. Cairns hospital was placed on code yellow yesterday amid unprecedented demand.  D\u2019Ath said 263 people presented at Cairns hospital\u2019s emergency department on Thursday - just short of the record of 280 - but many of the patients did not actually require emergency treatment.  Many of these cases can be more effectively managed in non-emergency settings ... Too often we are finding that people are turning to the local emergency department for medical care that could be provided by our excellent local general practitioners.  The number of active Covid-19 cases in the state rose to 41 on Thursday, up from 37 on Wednesday, all in hospital or hotel quarantine. D\u2019Ath said 1,993 people received their first vaccine dose from one of the state\u2019s 17 hubs in the 24 hours to 9am on Thursday, taking the total number of people jabbed in the state to 13,989.    Updated at 1.34am GMT     1.15am GMT       Australian officials have stopped short of attributing blame for the cyber attack on the Australian National University in 2018 but have told an inquiry at least five countries have the capability to have done so. Marc Ablong, a deputy secretary at the Department of Home Affairs with responsibility for national resilience and cyber security, said officials were also aware of a much more recent cyber attack on Melbourne\u2019s RMIT university \u201cand there are investigations under way\u201d. Ablong was among officials giving evidence to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security, which is investigating national security risks to the higher education and research sector. While there has been speculation that China may have been behind the ANU hack, Ablong made clear that the government had not attributed blame it to any particular country. He said the ANU cyber attack was conducted by \u201can advanced threat actor\u201d, nothing that there were a number of \u201cstate actors\u201d and highly sophisticated criminal groups that had the ability and intent to carry out such attacks. \u201cThere are at least five different state actors that have got that level of capability, and criminal enterprises are becoming more sophisticated in their capabilities,\u201d Ablong said, without naming those countries.  It can often take a great many months if not years to go through at a very forensic level to be able to identify and lawfully prove who the actor is.  Speaking more generally, Ablong said the cyber security risks to higher education and other organisations was increasing.  The threat is very real, it is getting a lot realer and a lot harder, even for very sophisticated organisations ... The sophistication and ability of either states or criminal organisations to undertake cyber hacks is very real and it is only going to get worse.

Originally Morrison said the aim was to vaccinate 4 million people by March, but this seems pretty out of the question at this point.   The fact that they\u2019re on 100,000, it is now March 11, they have just a few weeks to deliver 3.9 million vaccinations.  Now this isn\u2019t a target that was set by anyone other than this government but this government is defined by the fact that for them it\u2019s the announcement that matters, not the delivery.  Now in fairness to the government, I think that 100,000 number was from Tuesday. I\u2019ll see if I can get an updated one for you.     Updated at 1.06am GMT     12.57am GMT       Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese says the government\u2019s new tourism support package is being used as an attempt to win over marginal seats.   What this government did, what they do with sports rorts, what they do with community safety grants, what they do with today\u2019s announcements is they always look at one thing and it\u2019s not who needs support the most.  It\u2019s not regional economic development ... it is the electoral map ... In Tasmania, northern Tasmania gets support, southern Tasmania not. I wonder what the distinction is between the two. It is called the two marginal seats are in northern Tasmania. In the Northern Territory, Darwin nothing, but of course Alice Springs and Uluru where in the seat of Lingiari, gets support.   Albanese also criticised the package\u2019s focus on airlines.   This isn\u2019t a tourism package. It is a selective aviation package. There is nothing in this package for hotel operators.  There is nothing in this package for those people, for example, who are tourism operators who will take people out on day trips, who will examine the benefit that is here in this region, whether it be the surf coast, the Great Ocean Road, the Otways, there is nothing in this package for tourism operators.

An influx of Covid-19 patients from Papua New Guinea has sparked a \u201ccode yellow\u201d emergency at the Cairns hospital, the ABC reports. The internal emergency declaration triggers strategies to help the hospital cope when it nears capacity. The six Covid-19 patients are all being treated in isolation, and came from hotel quarantine. But the specialised care they need, combined with a record 263 emergency department presentations last weekend, means the hospital is under significant pressure. Cairns and Hinterland hospital and Health Service executive director Don Mackie spoke to the ABC:  Six or seven beds doesn\u2019t sound like a lot but they are in specific areas, they are in highly specialised negative pressure rooms that reduce the risk of cross-infection...

Photograph: Saeed Khan/AFP/Getty Images    Long noted that while 80% of hotel guests in Sydney and Melbourne have traditionally been international tourists, as a result of the government\u2019s ongoing international border closure, \u201cour hotels in these two major international gateways currently have a forward booking rate of less than 10% for the next 90 days and desperately need immediate support.\u201d Long said:   Our workforce is highly skilled and the government has not provided the support for our skilled chefs, waiters, revenue managers and duty managers in the same way as they have for airlines. This means it will have a dramatic negative impact once international borders open and we don\u2019t have the team members to provide the high service levels they demand.  Loans are only helpful when you have a level of certainty of revenue to service debts and a clear strategy to keep the economy open. Without this, Australia\u2019s accommodation businesses can\u2019t take on new debit even if banks are prepared to lend to them.

Readers may recall this inquiry was launched last year after a push by Coalition backbenchers who raised concerns China\u2019s Thousand Talents Plan \u2013 a research collaboration program \u2013 may be \u201cdesigned to harvest research and talent and intellectual property from other countries for the benefit of the Chinese government\u201d, as Liberal MP Andrew Hastie said at the time. The first witness at today\u2019s hearings, Alex Joske, a former researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said talent recruitment programs raised serious national security concerns and the important thing was to ensure researchers were disclosing conflicts of interest. He called for \u201cgood management of conflicts of interest and risk\u201d. Among Joske\u2019s recommendations is for the government to specifically prohibit participation by government employees in overseas talent recruitment programs, to send a \u201cvery important signal\u201d. He told the committee he was aware of at least one case of a CSIRO employee who joined a talent recruitment program, even though it seemed existing guidelines should have restricted that kind of activity  We shouldn\u2019t be entirely banning talent recruitment programs ... the focus should be on ensuring transparency.  Joske said while the guidelines in the university foreign interference taskforce should be \u201ccountry agnostic\u201d, the government\u2019s allocation of resources to study and respond to threats needed to be informed by information about \u201cwhere the threat is emanating from\u201d. \u201cThat seems to be primarily from China,\u201d he said, while saying the concerns may also include Russia, Iran and now Myanmar.  But I think if you take the country out of talent recruitment programs you\u2019re missing what really makes them concerning because there are very unique features of how China carries out some of these activities, how it approaches engagement with our universities that I think the government needs to understand and our universities need to understand in order to manage those risks appropriately.  He said he had estimated up to $280m of Australian Research Council funding was going to individuals who were concurrently in talent recruitment programs in China.

The Legislative Council\u2019s Economy and Infrastructure Committee will head the inquiry after tourism significantly declined during the last year of lockdowns and travel restriction.  A parliament spokesperson pointed to Victoria\u2019s high country who relies on tourism for a third of the region\u2019s employment. They said visitor numbers halved in 2020 for domestic and international visitors.  They also highlight tourism along the Murray, \u201cwhich provides the largest number of jobs outside of Melbourne\u201d, had an 80% drop in international tourism spending.  Committee chair Enver Erdogan released a statement this morning.   Domestic and international travel restrictions due to the global pandemic have hit our local economy hard. The impact has been particularly significant in tourism dependent regions.  The inquiry will also cover the hard-hit events industry.   The events sector, including the arts, sports and business events, has suffered dramatic losses. Modelling has shown that in the City of Melbourne alone many jobs were lost in arts and recreation services with a large economic cost.

Currently, the half-price tickets will only be available for those crossing state lines, so for example a Brisbane resident would still have to pay full price to get to the Whitsundays.

Photograph: Sarah Lai/AFP/Getty Images    Treasurer Cameron Dick spoke to ABC radio this morning:  There are some dead set head-scratchers in this that seem bizarre \u2013 like why can\u2019t Queenslanders be supported to travel to Queensland, why can\u2019t they go to Cairns. Queenslanders want to back Queensland, that\u2019s why our economy is coming back and leading the pack nationally. People want to go, in Brisbane and in the southeast, they want to go to Cairns but this scheme says no. Instead, we have to go to places like Launceston, or Merimbula.  He said the federal government had not consulted the state about the plan at all and he had \u201ca theory\u201d about why it chose some regional areas but not others. The treasurer highlighted that NSW coastal town of Merimbula was in the Labor held federal seat of Eden-Monaro while Launceston was in the Liberal held Bass \u2013 both marginal electorates. The support package is also reliant on states keeping borders open \u2013 something the federal government has been campaigning for months, but Dick wouldn\u2019t commit to this.   No, we will act on the health advice ... that\u2019s been consistent the position we\u2019ve taken all along and of course, that was endorsed by the people of Queensland in the election last October.

From the manna gums of the Monaro high plains to the snow gums of the Australian alps, the scale of eucalypt dieback is confronting and it has accelerated dramatically over the past decade. Scientists know that in the case of the snow gums, the native wood borer is essentially eating trees from the top down... But what they\u2019re yet to fully grasp is why those insects have been able to take hold in such numbers and do so much damage, and what underlying stressors have left eucalyptus trees vulnerable to attack.

The letter, which was also signed by the co-chair fo the Minderoo Foundation, Nicola Forrest; Fortescue Metals Group CEO Elizabeth Gaines; Noongar medical Prof Sandra Eades, Prof Marcia Langton, chef Stephanie Alexander, ABC chair Ita Buttrose, Grattan Institute CEO Danielle Wood, and Australian Council of Social Services CEO Dr Cassandra Goldie, was sent to Morrison this week.  It says:  While we have made some strides on gender equality over recent decades, we are still falling short for women in almost every workplace, including the Federal Parliament. Australia\u2019s post-pandemic economic recovery depends on finding ways to support and unlock economic growth and jobs. One way to do this is to unlock the productivity gains that come from increasing women\u2019s workforce participation.  Lack of access to affordable childcare is a \u201cmajor barrier\u201d stopping women returning to work, they said.  It is time to recognise that investing in an accessible childcare and early learning system, with valued and well-supported educators, will return a triple dividend: it will improve early learning outcomes for Australian children, increase workforce participation for women, and have long-term productivity gains by contributing to a more skilled workforce. We, the undersigned, are calling on you, Prime Minister, to ensure the upcoming Federal Budget makes the lives of Australian women easier, not harder.     Updated at 9.35pm GMT     9.28pm GMT    PM says travel package is 'a shot in the arm' to tourism industry    Prime minister Scott Morrison is heralding this move as a \u201cnew phase\u201d in Australia\u2019s Covid-19 recovery:      Prime minister Scott Morrison during the aviation and tourism package announcement at Sydney airport in Sydney, Thursday, 11 March 2021. Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP     As jobkeeper ends at the end of this month, together with the Covid supplement, we go into a new phase where we\u2019ll see the economy continue to grow and continue to support jobs all around the country.  But in the aviation, in the travel, in the tourism sectors, we know it will continue to be tough, particularly in those parts of the country most reliant on international tourism. And that\u2019s why today we have brought together ... this package which gives a shot in the arm to the travel, tourism and the aviation sector.  800,000 tickets to ride for Australians to go out and ensure that they can experience this amazing country. That\u2019s what this is about. To keep people in their jobs, we\u2019ve gotta put planes in the air, and we\u2019ve gotta put tourists on the ground.     Updated at 11.12pm GMT     9.22pm GMT       And the press conference is starting now.  First up, the dulcet Irish lilt of Qantas CEO Alan Joyce:   This is great news for Australian aviation. This is great news for Australian tourism. This is great news for Qantas, but particularly for Qantas employees, who have suffered pretty badly over the last year.  Joyce seems particularly pleased about the assistance plan for the still grounded international crews and workers.   The two components that I think makes a big difference to us, first of all, is the 800,000 discounted tickets. That will stimulate demand, that will get people to go to the 13 destinations, the 13 regions, and it will cover 57 different routes on our network, to get them to travel at non-peak times... I\u2019m actually probably most pleased about is the assistance plan for the employees linked to international operation. That\u2019s 7,500 of our employees.  We know international is some time off. It\u2019s probably not gonna happen until the end of October when we have the full adult population vaccinated. But this program allows those people to stay connected with Qantas so we don\u2019t lose them.   Joyce said he hopes to start 22 of the 25 regular international Qantas destinations and all 13 of the Jetstar\u2019s by the end of October.     Updated at 10.15pm GMT     9.16pm GMT       Ooooh, do I smell the faint sense of an ulterior motive this morning? Deputy prime minister Michael McCormack has confirmed that the new travel plan is reliant on state premiers keeping borders open.   Well, the onus is then on premiers not to make those knee-jerk, hasty decisions at a moment\u2019s notice to have snap border closures.  And as the vaccine rolls out, and as jobkeeper comes off, and, of course, so many people are going to be getting back to work, we need to make sure that those premiers keep those borders open. We can\u2019t have them just close the borders at a small community transmission outbreak.  You know, we need to get on with it. We\u2019ll take the best possible medical advice, but as Brendan Murphy has said too, we need to be able to learn to live with this, we need to be able to get that vaccine rolling out, as that extends right throughout the nation, we need to get back to some sort of pre-Covid normality.     Updated at 10.30pm GMT     9.10pm GMT       Speaking of the deputy prime minister, (and minister for transport, regional development and infrastructure) Michael McCormack has just spoken with ABC news breakfast.  McCormack was asked if travel agents and other travel industry workers would miss out:  They benefit too, because there\u2019s a $132m package in addition to the $128m that we\u2019d already had on the table for those travel agents.  And I know the Federation of Travel Agents are delighted with this package, because that is going to support them.  There\u2019s 40,000 people who work as travel agents, 80% of whom, Lisa, are women. And so we\u2019ve backed them too and we\u2019ll continue to do so.     Updated at 11.40pm GMT     9.06pm GMT       We are expecting to hear from the prime minister and the deputy prime minister shortly. They are at Syndey airport to launch this new travel package.        9.05pm GMT    No 'immediate' surgery plans for Daniel Andrews    Last night Victorian premier Daniel Andrews released this statement from the Alfred hospital where he is currently being treated for a fractured spine.  Andrews slipped and fell on wet steps outside the Mornington Peninsula home he was a holiday at with his family over the long weekend.  While there are no \u201cimmediate\u201d plans for surgery he could still undergo a procedure in the coming days and will be off work for more than a month regardless.  Associate Professor Steve McGloughlin, the head of the intensive care unit at The Alfred hospital where Andrews is currently a patient, said the premier was \u201ccomfortable and his pain is well-controlled\u201d.  A multidisciplinary team including intensive care, trauma and orthopaedic specialists has developed a treatment plan, together with the Andrews family. Mr Andrews has sustained some serious injuries, and his condition is being monitored closely.

Morrison has so far resisted calls for an independent inquiry into historical rape allegations levelled against the attorney general, saying NSW police have declared the case closed and Porter is an \u201cinnocent man under our law\u201d. But independent senator Rex Patrick currently holds a crucial vote on the government\u2019s industrial laws says it is \u201cimpossible\u201d to make progress until Porter returns from stress leave. He told ABC:  Asking Michaelia Cash to step in and do the negotiations where Christian Porter has had significant involvement in this negotiation from the get go is unreasonable.  Patrick seems unconvinced with the prime minister\u2019s line that there is nothing left to investigate and the \u201crule of law\u201d has run its course.   That may suit him politically, but he is a little bit naive in that this will become an albatross around his government\u2019s neck if he does not act... [Porter] has to have his name cleared so that he enjoys the trust of government and indeed the trust of the Australian public.     Updated at 10.39pm GMT     8.46pm GMT       So I know you are all desperate to hear which Aussie tourism destinations will be included in this half-price flight package, and who am I to deny you.  Currently, the locations include: Queensland: the Gold Coast, Cairns, the Whitsundays and Mackay region including Proserpine and Hamilton Island, and the Sunshine Coast.  NT: Lasseter and Alice Springs.  Tasmania: Launceston, Devonport and Burnie. WA: Broome. Victoria: Avalon. NSW: Merimbula. SA: Kangaroo Island. It\u2019s worth noting that some in the hotel and tourism industry have already come out to criticise the scheme for targeting areas that are already expected to have a healthy tourism season over the Easter and winter holidays while operators in large cities miss out.     Updated at 10.41pm GMT     8.36pm GMT       Good morning, Matilda Boseley here to bring you all the important updates this Thursday.  I\u2019m not going to lie to you though, today I\u2019m going to have the blog open in one tab and a bunch of airline websites open in the others because according to the government, it\u2019s holiday time! That\u2019s right, we finally have some clarity on what the ongoing federal government support packages for the tourism industry will look like, and the name of the game seems to be half price flights.  Today the Morrison government will unveil their $1.2 billion tourism and aviation rescue package where an estimated 800,000 government-subsidised airline tickets will be offered.  There will be a 50 per cent discount to 12 initial popular holiday locations between April 1 and July 31.  Now I\u2019ll bring you more on this as the morning goes but here are some other things to look out for:   Doctors are yet to decide whether Victorian premier Daniel Andrews will need surgery on his fractured spine. Late last night a spokeswoman from the premier\u2019s office confirmed there was no \u201cimmediate\u201d need for spinal surgery, despite a fracture of the T7 vertebrae in the middle of his spine and cracked ribs. Surgery or not Andrews is expected to be out of action for more than a month.  The Queensland parliament has passed legislation to ban single-use plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates along with polystyrene foam food containers and cups from September 1. A Melbourne truck driver allegedly involved in the fatal Eastern Freeway crash that killed four Victoria Police officers last year is set to face court today. Yesterday Porsche driver Richard Pusey, who\u2019s car was being impounded when the crash occurred pleaded guilty to outraging public decency after filming one of the police officers as they died.

Officials told the Senate\u2019s Covid-19 inquiry that supply constraints and the longer 12-week window between AstraZeneca doses meant some may have to wait until December to get their second shot. The Labor chair of the committee, Katy Gallagher, said the evidence on Thursday contradicted the \u201cclear language\u201d from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, of full vaccination by October. But the health department secretary, Prof Brendan Murphy, claimed it was a \u201csemantic debate\u201d that \u201cdoesn\u2019t really matter\u201d because people would receive protection against Covid-19 from the first dose.   Related: Australia's Covid vaccine rollout has begun, so how is it going and when can you get the jab?    In December, Hunt promised Australians would be \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d by October. But the government began to shift its language because clinical studies found AstraZeneca, the backbone of Australia\u2019s vaccination program, was more effective when given 12 weeks apart, not the four weeks the original timetable was based on. When AstraZeneca was given full approval in February, Hunt said that \u201cevery Australian who seeks to have the vaccine will be in a position to have had at least the first dose\u201d but the government would consider \u201cwhat it means in regards to the second dose\u201d. On Tuesday, the secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, told the committee he understood the commitment to mean both doses would be given by the deadline. On Thursday, Morrison said the \u201cfull adult population\u201d would be vaccinated by October. But Murphy and Caroline Edwards, the health department associate secretary, confirmed this meant only the first dose. \u201cWe are still planning and hoping to have both shots by the end of October,\u201d Edwards told the committee on Thursday. \u201cIn the event that we didn\u2019t get all shots by the end of October, the second shot would be finished six weeks after the end of October.\u201d Edwards said there was \u201cno end\u201d to the program, so those turning 18 or who previously did not consent may be added to the program after October, which Labor\u2019s Murray Watt suggested could push vaccinations into 2022. The officials blamed supply delays, such as Italy blocking 250,000 doses, the new 12-week gap between doses, and possible interruptions such as the need to redirect the vaccination rollout towards places with an outbreak. Murphy said the federal government believed it would have 3.8m AstraZeneca doses by now but \u201cwe\u2019ve only had 700,000\u201d due to \u201csovereign vaccine issues in Europe\u201d. \u201cSo that vaccine supply has been a significant issue.\u201d By late March, CSL is expected to produce 1m doses of AstraZeneca a week locally, and the government is pressing it to increase production further, Murphy said. Murphy conceded that \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d does refer to completing a program of both doses, but argued \u201cin terms of protection the first dose is fully protective\u201d. \u201cEvery Australian adult will be offered a vaccine by the end of October. \u201cIf a small number haven\u2019t had their second AstraZeneca that doesn\u2019t really matter, they are fully protected by the first dose. It is entirely consistent with what the prime minister and minister have said in the media.\u201d Australia\u2019s vaccination rollout is ambitious, requiring at least 180,000 vaccinations a day, a rate higher than most countries are achieving. The Australian Medical Association has said the government is unlikely to achieve its target of October and a more realistic target would be December due to a shortage of vaccine supply. With just 125,000 doses given so far, the federal government has already abandoned its interim target of 4m by the end of March. Also on Thursday, health authorities in Victoria revealed that a resident of an aged-care home had returned a weak positive result for Covid-19. The resident of Epping Gardens Aged Care caught the virus during Melbourne\u2019s second wave outbreak last year when 240 staff and residents at the facility tested positive and 38 people died. A spokeswoman from the department of health said the result was likely to be due to viral shedding rather than reinfection \u2013 but precautionary measures have been put in place. The Department of Defence separately confirmed members of HMAS Sydney experienced \u201cmild side-effects\u201d after receiving the Covid-19 vaccine. The ABC reported that crew members were admitted to St Vincent\u2019s hospital in Sydney as a precaution after experiencing side-effects from the vaccine. In a statement, the department said no members of the ship were currently in hospital, but would not comment on whether any crew had previously been admitted.   Related: End of December more realistic target for all Australians to get Covid vaccine, AMA says    A Defence spokesperson said the ship\u2019s crew had voluntarily received the vaccine ahead of a deployment to North America. The ship sailed with its full crew on Thursday. \u201cIn accordance with Department of Health guidelines, members of the ship\u2019s company were encouraged to report to medical personnel if they were feeling unwell after their vaccination. Some members experienced mild side-effects, which were resolved shortly after reporting,\u201d a Defence spokesperson said. \u201cIt is not unusual to experience mild side-effects after any vaccination. Serious allergic reactions are rare.\u201d Earlier, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told the Senate inquiry he had been notified of adverse events, but aside from \u201ca few cases of anaphylaxis\u201d there was \u201cnothing untoward\u201d in side-effects from the vaccine. \u201cThere have been some deaths following immunisation but not related to the immunisation,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen three cases of severe allergic reactions, but they were handled expertly and quickly, with no ongoing adverse effects.\u201d Other adverse events are relatively minor and include pain at the injection site, some fever, body pain, headache, Kelly said, but \u201cnothing untoward\u201d. Murphy said the \u201cunfortunate narrative\u201d that the Pfizer vaccine was more effective than AstraZeneca \u201cis now dead\u201d because they are \u201cequally efficacious\u201d. \u201cThere is no difference between their efficacy.

Reynolds, who died on the floor of prison having an asthma attack in 2018, was deprived of \u201cat least some chance\u201d of surviving by the \u201cconfused, uncoordinated and unreasonably delayed\u201d response to his emergency by prison guards and health staff, the NSW coroner said. \u201cThese failures were due both to numerous system deficiencies and to individual errors of judgement,\u201d Elizabeth Ryan said. She said it took more than 11 minutes for correctional officers to reach his side, 13 minutes for a nurse to be summoned, 22 minutes before a nurse arrived at his side and 47 minutes before ambulance paramedics attended him. Outside the court, Reynolds\u2019 family expressed their solidarity with the families of the three people who had died in custody in the past week. \u201cPeople should not die in prisons away from their loved ones,\u201d Makayla Reynolds said. \u201cLast week another two people died in NSW prisons. This morning we were advised of another death in Victoria. Our thoughts and support go to their families. No family should ever have to go through this.\u201d The two prison deaths in NSW only came to light when a bureaucrat was questioned in a parliamentary hearing by Greens MP David Shoebridge.

But the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service disagreed. \u201cThe NSW government has an obligation to let people know things that are in the public interest, and this includes when there has been a death in their care,\u201d its chief executive, Karly Warner, said.

Other beneficiaries of EU exports included Hong Kong (1.3m), Singapore (967,030), the US (953,723), Chile (942,825) and Malaysia (751,140). \nThe majority of vaccines exported from the EU to the UK were made by Pfizer, which distributes globally from its European production sites, it is understood. The EU has blocked only one export request under its controversial authorisation mechanism for vaccines, a shipment of 250,000 Oxford/AstraZeneca doses from Italy to Australia. \nOn Tuesday Michel, who chairs the summits of EU leaders and helps direct policy, provoked an angry reaction in London after stating in a newsletter that the UK had \u201cimposed an outright ban on the export of vaccines or vaccine components produced on their territory\u201d. \nIn a sign of the testy state of relations, Michel\u2019s claim about a British export ban was swiftly denounced as \u201ccompletely false\u201d by the UK foreign secretary, Dominic Raab. \nThe EU\u2019s ambassador Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida was summoned to the Foreign Office but he was in Brussels. Instead, the EU\u2019s charge d\u2019affaires in London, Nicole Mannion, the Irish deputy head of the Brussels delegation to the UK, was received on Wednesday morning by Sir Philip Barton, the permanent undersecretary of the Foreign Office. Barton is understood to have conveyed the government\u2019s irritation about the claims. \nA UK government spokesperson said the meeting had been necessary \u201cto discuss the issue of incorrect assertions in recent EU communications\u201d. \nSpeaking to MPs on Wednesday, Boris Johnson waded into the row to emphasise that Michel, a former prime minister of Belgium, had been wrong to allege the UK had imposed a prohibition on vaccine exports. \nJohnson said: \u201cWe can also be proud of the support the UK has given to the international Covid response, including the \u00a3548m we\u2019ve donated to Covax. I therefore wish to correct the suggestion from the European council president that the UK has blocked vaccine exports. Let me be clear, we have not blocked the export of a single Covid-19 vaccine or vaccine components. \n\u201cThis pandemic has put us all on the same side in the battle for global health. We oppose vaccine nationalism in all its forms. I trust all sides of the house will join me in rejecting this suggestion and call on our partners to work together to tackle this pandemic.\u201d \nIn his contentious newsletter, Michel sought to compare the EU\u2019s exporting record to that of the UK and other countries including the US, in response to suggestions that the bloc was verging on protectionism in barring a recent export of vaccines from Italy to Australia. \nTwo weeks ago Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, suggested that Britain and the US had blocked the export of Covid-19 vaccines. Von der Leyen has asked Joe Biden to lift the US ban on exports. \nThe UK has regulations to stop profiteering on medicines and medical items such as masks but the government does not impose a ban on vaccine components or completed doses. \nThe UK did ensure that vaccine doses produced by Oxford/AstraZeneca at the sites in Staffordshire and Oxford were directed in the first instance to residents in Britain. \nThe EU has since been angered by the refusal of the Anglo-Swedish firm to redirect doses in light of production shortfalls from European facilities. The company has in response pointed to its policy of having dedicated and largely separate supply chains for the UK and the EU. \nAn UK official said the high number of EU exports was a reflection of the business model of Pfizer and other major pharmaceutical suppliers who produce largely from European sites to distribute globally. \nMichel tweeted on Tuesday night: \u201cGlad if the UK reaction leads to more transparency and increased exports to EU and [other] countries.

Drawn along on dark somnambulic rhythms, it incorporates elements of fantasy, horror and 80s synthwave aesthetics without giving itself over completely to any of them. A wordless first 10 minutes introduces us to Sarah (Julia Sarah Stone), a runaway student apparently unwelcome or unwilling to return home, waking in spectrally lit parks and falling asleep in coffee shops. Dropping suddenly into surrealistic CGI dreams that track inexorably towards a demonic figure who, if approached too closely, wakes her with a start. Sarah decides to try to climb out of this insomniac bath by enrolling in a university sleep study. It is overseen by Dr Meyer, a Cronenbergian academic in big glasses, but run by a trio of researchers who, like the memory technicians in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, have a loose relationship with scientific protocol. Becoming close to Jeremy (Landon Liboiron), she learns that they are using pioneering technology to observe the subjects\u2019 dreams \u2013 and that the same shadowy presence manifests in all of them.              But Burns doesn\u2019t pursue this supernatural lead where you would expect, committing instead to a dream-logic that mostly abrogates him of plot duties. Acting as his own cinematographer and editor, he puts together a blow-out of imagery with great technical skill that fleshes out this waking dream of a film. Sarah watches her dream self in Jeremy\u2019s mind\u2019s eye on the monochrome monitors, which later melds into a stylised aquamarine-flooded sex scene that is like a Michael Mann wet dream (a debt acknowledged by the use of Shriekback\u2019s Coelacanth, the spine-chilling tune from Manhunter). Talking is beside the point \u2013 and, with Stone adept at mute trepidation, it often feels that way even when there is some dialogue.

The short answer: truth | Clive Myrie", "full_article": "Who, what, where, when and why? Five questions that are at the heart of our trade. Answer those questions in relation to any news story, and we\u2019re doing our jobs as journalists. They underpin everything we do, what we write in a newspaper or online, what we say on TV or on the radio. It feels to me, however, that we sometimes need to ask one of those questions of ourselves: why? It doesn\u2019t have to be every day or all the time, but given the power we have, it\u2019s important. What is the point of the media in a democracy? What are we here for? We can influence massive societal changes. Indirectly we even wield political power, able to influence policy, perhaps even able to help change governments. And with power as we\u2019re all well aware, comes great responsibility. Former Sunday Times editor Harold Evans understood this down to the marrow in his bones, and he chose throughout his storied career to leverage that power for the greater good of society. But who should police this? Is it enough to let the industry itself be the gatekeeper of how far a broadcaster or newspaper should go in trying to make a profit or build an audience? Or are independent regulators the only way to ensure media companies use the power they have wisely? Contrast the situation here in the UK, where there is a robust and for some choking regulatory framework with the US, where oversight in one crucial respect is nonexistent: the requirement to fairly represent the views of opposing sides in news and current affairs broadcasts. Could that lack of a check on how America does news actually imperil democracy itself? In 2009, James Murdoch, son of Fox News\u2019s founder, Rupert, gave a speech at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. His MacTaggart lecture made it clear what he believed the role of the media was in a democracy. Making money was the starting point from which everything else flowed: all the good, benign stuff \u2013 creativity, public trust and news coverage that was truly independent and challenged the consensus. His exact words were: \u201cThe only reliable, durable, and perpetual guarantor of independence is profit.\u201d It follows, then, and James Murdoch agreed that the only regulator should be the market. If the public doesn\u2019t like your product, it will go someplace else. It\u2019s the public that will keep you on the straight and narrow. There is no need for a regulator invested with powers by statute. Harry Evans didn\u2019t agree with statutory regulation, in his case for newspapers. As he told a BBC interview: \u201cWhen you start writing the law \u2026 between the sentences, between the commas, a whole scandal may escape because of a well-meaning intent to protect somebody, or someone\u2019s interest.\u201d But Evans did firmly believe in powerful independent regulation with teeth, even though it wasn\u2019t backed by statute, because maintaining public trust in the press was vital. He called for press regulation that was tough and that went beyond what many in Fleet Street wanted. After the Leveson inquiry into press standards, he supported proposals for a regulator which would be wholly independent of commercial interests and the publishers of newspapers. \u201cIt must be committed only to enhancing the standards of the British press,\u201d he said, \u201cand restoring public confidence. It is a necessary condition of the freedom of the press to act in the public interest.\u201d   Related: The British press isn't racist, say the editors. That just shows how long the problem will endure | Joseph Harker    Broadcasters in the UK are forced to be fair and impartial in their news coverage, in order to hold a licence. The rules come under section 5 of the regulator Ofcom\u2019s codes covering due impartiality, accuracy and opinions. Similar rules did exist in America, but they were thrown out more than 30 years ago, when Ronald Reagan was president, and attempts since to revive the legislation have always stalled on the altar of the first amendment, the right to free speech. So in the US you can say what you like within the law \u2013 your opinion is protected and you can use all your power and might to beam that opinion right across the land, without giving any counter-arguments, without reporting the opposing point of view. Opinion can be dressed up as news. The storming of the US Capitol on 6 January this year shamed America, but was partly the logical conclusion of a toxic media environment with no rules, promoting public distrust. It was one consequence of a media free-for-all and was years in the making. And where there is a void of fact and truth and public trust, conspiracy theories can live and breed. I travelled round this country during the 2019 election campaign \u2013 from County Durham to Southampton, Enniskillen to Pembrokeshire, and I came across people on the right who\u2019d be very happy to get their news from a UK equivalent of Fox News, and some on the left who\u2019d be very happy to watch a British equivalent of MSNBC. It\u2019s in this atmosphere that two new TV channels are coming onstream. GB News, under the leadership of the brilliant Andrew Neil, and a new venture backed by Rupert Murdoch. The New York Times quotes Neil as saying British news broadcasting is pretty much a one-party state. \u201cThey all come at stories from various shades of left,\u201d he says. \u201cGB News would come from the centre, perhaps the centre right, not the hard-right approach of Fox. GB News will offer diverse voices and stick to the facts,\u201d he says. He is too good a journalist, with a reputation to protect, to want to be associated with a news channel that peddles conspiracy theories and propaganda. And in any case, Ofcom, the regulator, is watching. Impartiality rules and strong regulation are the bulwark against the disaster of the American media jungle being replicated here, with its attendant detrimental effects on democracy. But with the perception of impartiality often being in the eyes and ears of the beholder, one Conservative MP, Steve Baker, influential in the Brexit vote and frequently interviewed about his views on the subject, believes Ofcom itself needs reform. When James Murdoch posed the \u201cwhy\u201d question in 2009, as chairman of BSkyB, he stressed the importance of a media company making money, untrammelled by regulation \u2013 that a better-informed society would flow from the market. But more than a decade later, when asked the same question, he\u2019s come to a very different conclusion. He\u2019s now attacking the US media for the current \u201ctoxic politics\u201d threatening American democracy, and said in an interview with the Financial Times that proprietors are as culpable as politicians, who \u201cknow the truth but choose instead to propagate lies\u201d. Harold Evans would probably never have thought there would be a day when a senior member of the Murdoch family would sound as if he agreed with him, not just about the purpose of the media but how it should be achieved. That there might actually be a point to independent regulators, because a clear and transparent set of rules and guidelines that everyone can follow and everyone can see increases public trust. I\u2019ll leave you with the words contained within the fairness doctrine, now consigned to history in America, but alive and well for many years to come, we all hope, in the regulations of Ofcom. Evans would no doubt agree.Licensees must not use their stations \u201cfor the private interest, whims or caprices of licensees, but in a manner which will serve the community generally as a whole. Broadcasters must provide adequate coverage of public issues, and ensure that coverage fairly represents opposing views.\u201dThe maintenance of democracy and a just and fair society.

On Thursday, Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) published its plans for the future of policing protests, two days after the government announced proposed new laws granting more powers to officers and the home secretary. Among other things, the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill will give Priti Patel powers to create laws to define \u201cserious disruption\u201d to communities and organisations, which police can then rely on to impose conditions on protests. The HMICFRS report, ordered by Patel following Extinction Rebellion (XR) and Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, outlines a \u201cneed to develop\u201d covert intelligence gathering methods and an expectation of increased use of facial recognition technology, despite a court of appeal ruling last year that its use in south Wales breached privacy rights and broke equalities law. The report also supports expanding stop and search \u201cto prevent serious disruption caused by protests\u201d, amid concerns over discriminatory use of the power. Emmanuelle Andrews, policy and campaigns officer at Liberty, said: \u201cThese plans are a staggering assault on our right to protest as well as an attack on other fundamental rights. \u201cPolice already have extensive powers to restrict protests, and frequently go beyond them even though it is their duty to facilitate the exercise of this right. \u201cWe are still in the grip of a pandemic that has changed all our lives, handed enormous powers to the government and dramatically restricted our protest rights. The proposals in the policing bill are an opportunistic bid from the government to permanently erode our rights. \u201cWe must reject the politics of division that the government is exploiting through this bill, and protect each other and our ability to stand up to power.\u201d The bill also allows for police to impose conditions such as start and finish times and maximum noise levels on static protests \u2013 powers officers already have in relation to marches. But the HMICFRS wants the rules to be even more closely aligned with those for marches, by forcing organisers of static protests to provide advance notice of their plans and enabling police to ban assemblies, with the consent of the home secretary, if the imposition of conditions would not be sufficient to prevent serious public disorder. Kevin Blowe, campaigns coordinator of the police monitoring group Netpol, criticised the report as \u201calarming and illiberal\u201d and \u201cessentially a series of recommendations on how you can massively expand surveillance on protest movements at a time when the government has decided that it\u2019s going to crack down on those protests\u201d. The report is the first to feature the term \u201caggravated activists\u201d instead of \u201cdomestic extremists\u201d, the use of which Netpol campaigned against for almost a decade. It defines aggravated activists as \u201cthose who commit protest-related crime or unlawful behaviour. The most frequent level of aggravated activism associated with protests is low.\u201d Alanna Byrne, of XR, said similar labels were applied in the past to other groups \u201con the right side of history\u201d, adding: \u201cPriti Patel can try and make the UK a protest-free zone but it\u2019s clear that the government is not going to do the right thing without protesters holding them to account so we don\u2019t plan on stopping anytime soon.\u201d Announcing the bill, the Home Office said the new laws would \u201cenable police to better tackle unauthorised encampments, and safely manage protests where they threaten public order or stop people from getting on with their daily lives\u201d. Matt Parr, from HMICFRS, said: \u201cThe right to gather and express our views is fundamental to our democracy. But this is not an absolute right. The police need to strike the correct balance between the rights of protesters and the rights of others, such as local residents and businesses. \u201cWe found that the police too often do not find the balance between protecting the rights of the protesters and preventing excessive disruption to daily life, which even peaceful protest can sometimes cause.\u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "A Nobel winner turns to picture books: 'It is a powerful way of telling a story'", "full_article": "Ever since Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 Nobel prize, her growing legions of English language fans have been eagerly awaiting the translation of her 1,100 page historical epic The Books of Jacob. So it\u2019s both surprising and amusing to find it gazumped by a slender picture book, meditating on the value of patience. The Lost Soul is the Polish author\u2019s first venture into picture books, and it pours a childlike sense of wonder into a once-upon-a-time tale that is already resonating with adults around the world. \u201cI adore the picture book,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique form of communication that sets off a sort of proto-cinema in our minds. The language has to be limited to what\u2019s absolutely essential. It\u2019s the picture that carries the story. For me it\u2019s a powerful, primeval way of telling a story that\u2019s able to get through to anyone, regardless of age, cultural differences or level of education.\u201d     \u2018Proto-cinema in our minds\u2019 \u2026 Olga Tokarczuk. Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images    Aptly, for a book published in a time of unprecedented stress, it\u2019s a fable of a man\u2019s decision to chill out and reconnect with himself, alone in a country cottage \u2013 though at first, he doesn\u2019t even realise that he needs to do so. \u201cHis life was all right without his soul \u2013 he slept, ate , worked, drove a car and even played tennis,\u201d it opens. \u201cBut sometimes he felt as if the world around him were flat, as if he were moving across a smooth page in a math exercise book, entirely covered in evenly spaced squares.\u201d After suffering a panic attack in a hotel bedroom, he takes off to see a wise doctor who advises him to take some time out, because only by sitting still and patiently waiting will he be able to reconnect with his soul. The story, which unfolds on pages latticed like a maths exercise book, is a collaboration with illustrator Joanna Concejo, who has fed and watered the short text so that it blossoms across 48 pages.     Illustrations from The Lost Soul, by Joanna Concejo. Photograph: Seven Stories Press    The pair, who are already working on a second book, first met while sneaking out for a cigarette at the Paris book fair. \u201cI said I loved her books, and it turned out she knew who I was, and was familiar with my illustrations,\u201d says Concejo, who has lived in France since graduating from art school in Poland. \u201cI was fascinated by Joanna\u2019s work,\u201d says Tokarczuk. \u201cSomehow, to me her pictures were soothing and calming. I found them irresistible.\u201d Their collaboration began when Tokarczuk was approached to write a picture book by one of Poland\u2019s leading children\u2019s publishers. She dug out the story, which had been languishing unfinished and untitled in her computer, and immediately suggested Concejo to illustrate it. \u201cI can\u2019t actually remember how I came to write it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt started life as a sort of tribute to someone who\u2019s always in a hurry and never has any time, because he\u2019s a man of action, working hard non-stop. Then I developed it, and this little story emerged. The theme of a soul in search of its owner appears in various cultures; it\u2019s one of those basic narratives that turns up now and then, in any place and at any time.\u201d She is clear that the finished work is as much Concejo\u2019s as her own: it was the illustrator\u2019s idea to personify the soul as a young girl, and to represent the growth of the man\u2019s soul in pots full of plants, notably tumbling geraniums. \u201cYes, there are lots of geraniums,\u201d says the illustrator. \u201cI love houseplants and I also have them on my balcony. I used not to like them \u2013 I thought they were rather dull and uninteresting. But in time I\u2019ve learned to appreciate them. Maybe because they\u2019re very hardy, and if you take care of them, they show their gratitude with lots of blossoms.\u201d     \u2018I never try to adapt my style to fit a particular audience\u2019 \u2026 an illustration from The Lost Soul by Joanna Concejo. Photograph: Seven Stories Press    Since being published in Poland in 2017, The Lost Soul has sold more than 100,000 copies in 21 languages, and is finally coming out in English in a translation by her longtime collaborator Antonia Lloyd-Jones. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting the book to be such a huge success, but it soon became clear that many people were buying it as a gift for a close friend to show that they care, to express their best wishes. The book was like a message. And there were others who just wanted to put it on the coffee table, as something to look at while relaxing. I like both these reasons for buying it,\u201d says Tokarczuk. Does the restrained palette and retro-imagery of people playing in a wintry Polish landscape make it a picture book for adults rather than children? \u201cI think picture books are increasingly important, and a lot of adults are interested in this sort of book, where a large part of the message is conveyed by the images. But I never try to adapt my style to fit a particular audience. I\u2019m not sure I know what that means, or how to do it,\u201d says Concejo. \u201cThe world in Joanna\u2019s drawings looks as it was a few decades ago, which is clearly a reference to the childhood of people who are now adults,\u201d adds Tokarczuk. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how calming and cathartic it can be to immerse yourself in the world of your childhood.\u201d  The Lost Soul by Olga Tokarczuk, translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and illustrated by Joanna Concejo, is published by Seven Stories Press on 18 March.

Photograph: AP    A survey of park rangers in more than 60 countries found that about one in five had lost their jobs because of pandemic-related budget cuts, with those in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia worst affected. More than half of protected areas in Africa reported that they had had to stop or reduce field patrols and anti-poaching operations. While many protected areas have maintained core operations, communities living near nature reserves and national parks have been particularly hard hit by the economic consequences of the pandemic and drops in visitors.

A review of Covid-19 economic recovery plans implemented or advanced between January and October 2020 found that while some governments included conservation areas and extra funding for nature, many have diminished environmental protections. Rachel Golden Kroner of Conservation International, the lead author of the study on impacts of government stimulus packages, warned that the current crisis could not be allowed to further damage natural environments. \u201cIf we are to build a sustainable future, rollbacks of environmental protections must be avoided, and recovery measures need to be planned in a way that not only avoids negative impacts on biodiversity, but charts a more sustainable and equitable way forward,\u201d she said. Reacting to the research, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, head of the Global Environment Facility, an independent financial organisation that helps fund countries to meet environmental targets, said: \u201cInvesting in nature conservation and restoration to prevent the future emergence of zoonotic pathogens such as coronaviruses costs a small fraction of the trillions of dollars governments have been forced to spend to combat Covid-19 and stimulate an economic recovery.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "From Ghana to London: James Barnor given major retrospective", "full_article": "A Ghanaian-British photographer who captured the African diaspora in 60s London and created black fashion images that inspired a new generation of artists is to have his work displayed on Piccadilly Circus\u2019s big screens as part of a major retrospective. In 1967, James Barnor took an iconic image of the BBC Africa Service reporter Mike Eghan on the steps of the Eros fountain in Piccadilly, and now more than 50 years later his own work will be beamed out overlooking the same spot during April. The retrospective at the Serpentine, originally supposed to open in June 2020, marks a spectacular rise for Barnor, 91, who until an expansive show at Autograph in 2010 was largely unknown in the British photography world. Barnor, who lives in London, started his career in his home town of Accra, Ghana, as a photojournalist before setting up his Ever Young studio, where he took portraits and staged images. \u201cI always treated my sitters and my customers with the utmost respect,\u201d he said. \u201cI was conscious of what people were wearing and tried to bring the best out of them.\u201d     James Barnor in Accra, circa 1952. Photograph: Autograph    When he moved to the UK he trained in photography and began shooting images for South Africa\u2019s Drum magazine, which included cover shots of black fashion models. The artist Liz Johnson Artur says Barnor\u2019s work presented a different take on the black communities that had settled in London in the 50s and 60s, which previously had had been mostly represented in images taken by white, European photographers. \u201cHis pictures were clearly taken by someone who was from the community but also there was a style that I really liked that wasn\u2019t about exposing but rather showing,\u201d she said. The Serpentine curators Lizzie Carey-Thomas and Awa Konat\u00e9 say Barnor\u2019s archive \u2013 which includes 40,000 images \u2013 amounts to a substantial survey of not just the diaspora in London, but also pre-independence Ghana, as Accra bubbled with Pan-Africanism and hopes for a new future.

While some observers warn that the regulator is no longer fit for purpose and must adapt to better deal with new digital media, Myrie used the Sir Harold Evans Memorial lecture to defend the fundamental purpose of the model.

Evidence of a different view in the US came earlier this week when CNN host Jake Tapper tweeted of the Ofcom investigation triggered by the complaints: \u201cThis is what happens when you live in a country where there is no first amendment.

It\u2019s a twisted, abstract sculpture, in steel, that looks at first glance like the cooling fins from a motorbike engine. It is, in fact, an unfurled bandone\u00f3n (button accordion), the fiendishly difficult instrument of German origin that produces the unmistakeable sound of tango: a pained and plangent breath from a broken heart.     A sculpture of the bandone\u00f3n (an accordion), used by Astor Piazzolla to produce the sound of tango , in Puerto Madero. Photograph: Cavan Images/Alamy    The composer, bandleader and musician who made the bandone\u00f3n globally famous was Astor Piazzolla, whose centennial in 2021 will be celebrated \u2013 or, at least, remembered \u2013 by players, dancers, singers and songwriters the world over. \u201cHis fingers move about that instrument as though they were snakes,\u201d said jazz legend Gerry Mulligan. For his part, Piazzolla said the button accordion had \u201ca velvet sound, a religious sound\u201d. He was the high priest of that religion.  On 5 March, Buenos Aires\u2019 venerable Col\u00f3n opera house reopened after a year-long closure with a two-week Piazzolla programme. Here in the UK, scheduled tributes, such as a \u201c\u00a1Viva Piazzolla!\u201d night at the Liverpool Philharmonic, have been either deferred or cancelled. There are, though, virtual events honouring the centennial, including monthly gigs beamed from Boedo in Buenos Aires, lectures and dance classes in Philadelphia and a free Piazzolla \u201ccyber jazz\u201d show from Nottingham . I\u2019ll be toasting Piazzolla\u2019s memory with a glass of Argentine vino and spinning a few scratchy shellacs on my ancient gramophone. All right, I exaggerate: tango brings out my inner melancholic. But I will take out some vinyls and CDs, not just Piazzolla but his precursors and heirs, and play the songs that changed my perception of Buenos Aires. Unable to be in the city right now \u2013 I lived there from 1991 to 2001 and visited at least once a year until 2019 \u2013 I rely on tango to transport me there. Piazzolla\u2019s one-time collaborator, the poet Horacio Ferrer, called Buenos Aires a \u201ctangopolis\u201d. He meant that, from the radio soundtrack during a taxi ride to the psychodramas of everyday life to the way people walk and talk, tango left an indelible mark on the city and its people. Does this mean that the tango city can be seen by the virtual visitor? Well, yes, but you have to squint somewhat to penetrate beyond the facades of the modern metropolis and \u2013 I\u2019d suggest \u2013 plug in a song or two on your earbuds to help you visualise the ghosts of the tango era.     Cafe Tortoni, a live tango venue in Buenos Aires, founded in 1858. Photograph: Emiliano Rodriguez/Alamy    It\u2019s often remarked, somewhat sensationally, that tango was born in the bordello. Certainly there are songs \u2013 such as Celedonio Flores\u2019s Margot \u2013 that namecheck this milieu, and orchestras were used in brothel waiting rooms to keep clients entertained. But tango experts agree that the primal origins were in the arrabales \u2013 the run-down outskirts along the river and the working-class districts of the fast-growing city of the 1890s. The place to get a sense of this is La Boca, which, away from the pastel-hued tourist honeypot of Caminito (named after a 1926 tango by Juan de Di\u00f3s Filiberto), has retained a shabby, edgy quality. Many tangos are set in the district, which as a port was a melting pot for immigrants from Europe as well as black Argentinians. \u00c1ngel Villoldo, an Argentinian of African heritage who has been dubbed the \u201cfather of tango\u201d, performed bright, sometimes bawdy songs in La Boca bar rooms in the first decade of the 20th century. Tango skipped across the ocean around this time, enjoyed a boom in Paris, and then arrived back in BA. The Argentinian middle classes promptly fell in love with it. Venues such as Cafe Hansen and the Armenonville cabaret sprang up around Buenos Aires\u2019 well-to-do barrios and, in 1912, wealthy bon vivant Baron Antonio de Marchi organised a showcase for a patrician audience at the Palais de Glace. This ushered in an era of great orchestras led by the likes of Osvaldo Fresedo, Juan Carlos Cobi\u00e1n and Julio de Caro. It\u2019s also the era of grand cafes: surviving landmarks like the Cafe Tortoni have kept up their links with tango through intimate concerts and milongas (dance nights); and many of the so-called caf\u00e9s notables (listed establishments) have photographs of tango greats on their walls; others are named after songs or artists.     The late Astor Piazzolla, with his bandone\u00f3n. Photograph: Eugene Maynard/Redferns    Tango canci\u00f3n (tango songs with words) dates from this period. Its foremost practitioner, Carlos Gardel, wrote music to words by poet-lyricists such as Alfredo Le Pera and Pascual Contursi. Hit songs \u2013 Volver, Mi Buenos Aires Querido, Por Una Cabeza \u2013 are alternative national anthems for many porte\u00f1os. There\u2019s a statue and street art celebrating Gardel in Abasto, where he spent most of his days when not on tour. The best monument to him is above his tomb at the Chacarita cemetery, while Recoleta\u2019s necropolis has the posh marble mausoleums, Chacarita\u2019s houses tango legends. Gardel fans sometimes drop by to leave flowers and to slot a lit cigarette between his statue\u2019s stone fingers. Gardel\u2019s songs about local bars, friendship, barrio life, betting and drinking played a major role in tango-ifying the city, showing any theme could be set to music \u2013 sad, sprightly or otherwise. A little later, tango went through an evolutionary period. Charismatic frontmen like An\u00edbal Troilo \u2013 another bandone\u00f3n superstar \u2013 and pianist Osvaldo Pugliese added layers of musical complexity, while women singers such as cross-dressing Azucena Maizani, glamorous Ada Falc\u00f3n, dirt-poor Rosita Quiroga and outspoken Peronist Nelly Omar \u2013 later blacklisted by the military government \u2013 challenged male hegemonies. In Buenos Aires, even the street names are sexist \u2013 but in the 1990s when Puerto Madero was made the city\u2019s 47th barrio, it was decided to honour women in street names; Maizani and Quiroga have their own calles now. By the second world war, the golden age of tango was pretty much over. In 1944, Enrique Cad\u00edcamo penned a song about the Palais de Glace that ripples with nostalgic longing. But Piazzolla, who had played in Troilo\u2019s band, had other ideas. He set out creating a \u201cnuevo tango\u201d that enlivened the rhythms of tango with jazz and neo-classical touches. He was not short on sentiment \u2013 his Adi\u00f3s Nonino (Goodbye Grandaddy) \u2013 is unashamedly slushy. But he introduced experimentation, chromatic harmonies, atonality, dissonance and a contemporary pace and punch. Inspired by Vivaldi he wrote a four-seasons cycle for Buenos Aires. He composed a \u201clittle opera\u201d called Mar\u00eda de Buenos Aires. He wrote symphonic works, used electric guitar and collaborated with vibraphone players and famous authors like Borges. Initially, the squares who preferred their tango in stockings and dandruffed suits rejected his ideas as pretentious and even traitorous; but in the end they were won over and, in June 1983, he had his own gala night at the Col\u00f3n \u2013 described by local daily La Naci\u00f3n as \u201cPiazzolla\u2019s apotheosis.\u201d     The tomb of the French-Argentine singer Carlos Gardel, at Chacarita cemetery. Photograph: Mariana Eliano/Cover/Getty Images    If Gardel\u2019s songs evoke Buenos Aires in a literal manner, Piazzolla\u2019s compositions conjure a more fantasy-laden city. Sublime works like Milonga del Angel, Escualo and Vuelvo al Sur contain hints of ideas about the city \u2013 the angel statues in the cemeteries, the dancers in the plazas, the cobbled streets of the southside \u2013 but never crudely or clumsily. Once, in San Telmo, I saw a young trio hammering out Libertango \u2013 the most famous of all Piazzolla\u2019s songs, thanks to Grace Jones\u2019s 1981 cover version \u2013 and the music made for an absolutely perfect soundtrack of the barrio as we see it today \u2013 past and present colliding, tangueros mixing with rock kids and metal fans, and tango a cultural artefact rather than a real, lived experience for most people.When I get over to Buenos Aires, I\u2019ll see a tango band at Centro Cultural Torquato Tasso, do some tango-themed walks and go shopping for records in the markets and disquer\u00edas. I\u2019ll pay my belated respects to Piazzolla. There\u2019s a bust of him in Recoleta and a statue in the Atlantic seaside resort of Mar del Plata, his birthplace; but the steel bandone\u00f3n remains the most fitting homage. He was a passionate and argumentative artist who enjoyed upsetting the establishment and took tango kicking and screaming out of the ballroom and in to the concert hall. He was a sublime writer and arranger of songs, suites, concerti and film music. But he was most fully himself when he was live on stage, at the front of a quintet or octet, pulling out the ends of his bandone\u00f3n as his brow unwrinkled and he let the angels, and devils, sing. He demonstrated, through his virtuosity, that the humble accordion possesses the emotional expressiveness of a violin or piano. He also proved you don\u2019t need to be a good dancer \u2013 or a dancer at all \u2013 to love, and live, tango. As someone who prefers his Latin rhythms sitting down, I\u2019m eternally indebted to Astor Piazzolla. Chris Moss is a travel and music writer.

He was arrested on Tuesday at his home in Deal, Kent. The Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, said: \u201cThe news today that it was a Metropolitan police officer who was arrested on suspicion of Sarah\u2019s murder has sent shockwaves and anger through the public and through the Met.

Our job is to patrol the streets and to protect people.\u201d \n \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \nOn Wednesday officers searched locations in London where Everard, 33, disappeared on the night of 3 March, as well as Deal, and woodland near Ashford including an abandoned paintball centre. Couzens had been arrested on Tuesday night on suspicion of kidnapping, alongside a woman in her 30s suspected of aiding an offender. Both remain in custody. In a statement, the Met said: \u201cToday, Wednesday 10 March, [Couzens] has been further arrested on suspicion of murder and a separate allegation of indecent exposure. The man is a serving Metropolitan police officer in the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command.\u201d \nLondon\u2019s mayor, Sadiq Khan, said: \u201cI know how shocked and worried Londoners are by Sarah\u2019s disappearance and the developments in the case. Londoners will continue to see more police officers on our streets continuing their investigation and carrying out reassurance patrols in the area where Sarah went missing a week ago.\u201d The Women\u2019s Equality party said an outside police force should be brought in, given the case involves a Met officer. The force has referred the case to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which said: \u201cFollowing assessment we determined that both conduct referrals relating to the kidnap/murder and indecent exposure should remain under local investigation by the force. We have also received a mandatory referral in relation to the actions of police after Sarah was reported missing.

It is my life. When I see a potter communicating their creativity via something they\u2019ve made, I can\u2019t help but cry. You\u2019re watching imagination come to life. It\u2019s so special.\u201d Crying over pots has become something of a USP for Jones, ever since he took to our screens in 2015 as one of the two judges of The Great Pottery Throw Down, a craft-based competition in the vein of Bake Off and Sewing Bee, placing hopefuls behind the rotating wheel for their chance at artistic success. Jones has cried at everything from delicate arrangements of bowls, to vases, sculptural forms and a dainty tea set. Where Paul Hollywood has his handshake of yeast-based approval, so Jones has his tears of kiln-fired delight. Yet this is no gimmick. Speaking to an overall-clad Jones by video link from his art studio in Whitstable, Kent, it is clear that pottery is his lifeblood and translating that passion to screen is what has made the show such a gently endearing success over its four series. Jones had an \u201cepiphany\u201d when he first discovered clay in art class as an 11-year-old. \u201cThe moment I touched the clay,\u201d he says, \u201cI realised this material was absolutely for me. It\u2019s this living, moving thing you\u2019re creating from and I couldn\u2019t get enough of it. When I reached the sixth form, I used to bunk off school and go to the V&amp;A museum, where I\u2019d spend all day looking at pots and reading up on them. Almost 40 years later, I\u2019m still learning.\u201d     Kiln-fired delight \u2026 Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney, Keith Brymer Jones and Rich Miller. Photograph: Mark Bourdillon/Love Productions    It wasn\u2019t his pottery prowess that initially earned Jones a spot on TV but a video he made parodying Adele and her hit Rolling in the Deep. Stuffed into a dress and heels, he sings: \u201cThere\u2019s a fire / Starting in my kiln / Hotter than that pottery scene / In that Patrick Swayze film.\u201d The YouTube clip, titled Rolling Clay with Keith, found its way to Bake Off producer Richard McKerrow. \u201cI was in a punk band as a teenager,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThat punk ethos has stayed with me. I don\u2019t take myself too seriously. Anyone can laugh at me or with me. It\u2019s absolutely fine. But the one thing I do with a passion is take my craft very seriously.\u201d Jones was sceptical about the appeal of a pottery show when he was first approached, though. \u201cI said pottery on telly would be like watching paint dry. I also didn\u2019t want to make a programme that sets people up to fail. I didn\u2019t want to do an X Factor. I have too much respect for the craft. And, to the show\u2019s credit, it turned out nothing like that at all. It has always extolled the virtues of the potters. It has revealed a wonderful process.\u201d Indeed, the format of the Channel 4 show is designed to highlight each competing potter\u2019s artistic development. We start with 12 keen home practitioners and one is eliminated each week, having been set a major making task and another speed-throwing against-the-clock challenge. This year, they have graduated from humble chamber pots to art deco punch bowls with matching decanters, which is the challenge in the final this Sunday. In the American-themed quarter final, they had to make pottery fired in cow dung and throw an Alabama ring bottle, which looked impossible. Then there was the hilarious second season episode where they were asked to make entire toilets, which kept collapsing. Meanwhile, the handle-pulling challenge was one of the most phallic episodes ever seen on TV.     Who wants a shot? \u2026 Ryan Barrett and his turtle toilet. Photograph: BBC/Love Productions    Siobh\u00e1n McSweeney, the Derry Girls actor who presents this latest season, thinks dedication has been key to the programme\u2019s appeal. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of agenda. It\u2019s not about sob stories or manipulation \u2013 it\u2019s a load of people genuinely trying to do their best and showing authentic creativity. You can\u2019t diminish the fact that these contestants are real nerds about pottery. Of course they want to win, but they would also usually not be able to afford all this clay or get feedback on these new techniques. It adds an extra dimension of genuine curiosity, which mirrors the audience\u2019s.\u201d It is a curiosity that McSweeney was allowed to explore herself during filming. \u201cIt turns out using the wheel is really hard,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s really physically demanding and, like everything in my life, if at first I don\u2019t succeed, I tend to drop it. So now I\u2019m on to embroidery.\u201d Still, it heightened her appreciation of the potters, all of whom isolated with the crew in a bubble at Gladstone Pottery Museum in Stoke-on-Trent for 11 weeks of filming in 2020. \u201cGetting the call to present the show was a godsend,\u201d she says. \u201cI had a very tough first lockdown because I was shielding and I was coming off the back of a rough couple of years having experienced a number of bereavements. Being able to do something so wholesome like this show in the countryside, and to be assured of my safety, was incredible. It meant that for the first time in a long time, I wasn\u2019t worried about my life. I didn\u2019t need to get up at 4am and dress in a giant condom to walk around the block. I could be in the fields instead. I came back rejuvenated.\u201d     \u2018Genuine curiosity\u2019 \u2026 Jodie Neale. Photograph: Love Productions    Rich Miller, who is the other judge in the show, echoes these sentiments. \u201cThe show has been a massive highlight in such a tough year,\u201d says Miller, over the sound of clay being slapped down on a nearby workbench in his studio. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but be inspired by people really pushing themselves. And the clay responds to the minds of the makers, so the creativity is infectious. I felt a real responsibility to encourage people to keep improving.\u201d As the show\u2019s former studio assistant, Miller used to have the nerve-shredding job of carrying the contestants\u2019 completed works to the drying racks and then into the kilns, hoping not to smash them on the way. Does Miller, like Jones, ever feel teary when the creations are placed before him? \u201cYou\u2019re observing the whole process they go through and you just want them to succeed. That\u2019s why Keith gets so emotional \u2013 you get invested. I was close to crying a few times but I thought I\u2019d better not tread on Keith\u2019s toes. Maybe it\u2019ll happen next time.\u201d Crying or not, Miller has a similarly personal connection to clay as Jones. \u201cI struggled through school,\u201d he says, \u201cbeing the only black kid out of around 1,500 other students. But ceramics was a real salvation because it\u2019s all about the material. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are, where you are, or what you\u2019re making, since we\u2019re all just trying to do the same thing: turn this material into something permanent. Even today, when I\u2019m making something, I lose myself in it. I love the possibilities with clay. It feels like there are no boundaries.\u201d   Related: Love and obsession: how leading UK ceramics collection ended up in London council flat    Jones thinks that, as well as the unashamed self-expression the show unlocks, there is a lesson to be learned: \u201cWe need to get back to an honest relationship with the natural materials we use in the world, an understanding of the craft that goes into making something, rather than expecting everything to be mass produced and cheap.\u201d He holds up a delicately glazed espresso mug and saucer. \u201cThis piece was given to me by one of the potters on the first series, a guy called Nigel. He was a builder and he had a real issue with his other builder mates giving him jibes about being on the show. But he produced this incredibly delicate piece. It was such a surprise to have this work from him. I love that, in life, you don\u2019t know when someone is going to surprise you like that, to totally defy your expectations. Isn\u2019t that beautiful? I have to stop now otherwise I\u2019ll start crying again.\u201d  The series finale of The Great Pottery Throw Down is on Channel 4 on 14 March at 8pm.

But researchers in California say they are now facing a different, unexpected hurdle: the state\u2019s outgoing Democratic attorney general. Under Xavier Becerra, who has been nominated to serve as Joe Biden\u2019s health secretary, California\u2019s department of justice started to deny researchers access to firearms data used to evaluate a wide range of gun laws and policies. The new data restrictions have put key projects at California\u2019s state-funded gun violence research center in limbo, and locked Becerra into a bitter, bizarre public standoff with one of America\u2019s most respected gun violence researchers.   series linker   California, which has much stricter gun laws than most American states, also has more detailed government data available, including records of individual handgun purchasers going back decades and statewide records about the restraining orders filed to temporarily bar at-risk people from owning or buying guns. This more detailed personal information has allowed California researchers to conduct rigorous analyses of the state\u2019s gun laws and policies, looking at early evidence of whether the state\u2019s new gun violence restraining orders have helped to prevent mass shootings, studying whether buying a handgun puts a person at higher risk of dying from gun suicide, and examining whether expanding the category of people with violent records who are barred from buying guns might reduce gun violence. But it\u2019s precisely this more detailed personal information, including about gun purchasers, and subjects of gun violence restraining orders, that Becerra\u2019s justice department is telling some researchers that it will not provide. The department is also attempting to formalize some of these policies, including in a proposed rulemaking under discussion this week that would limit researcher\u2019s access to personal information about the subjects of gun violence restraining orders across the state. The justice department has cited privacy concerns as a justification for the data restrictions, and has said it believes current California law does not permit the agency to release certain kinds of data to researchers. \u201cThe California department of justice values data-driven research and its role in pushing forward informed public policy to help combat problems like gun violence,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe also take seriously our duty to protect Californians\u2019 sensitive personally identifying information, and must follow the letter of the law regarding disclosures of the personal information in the data we collect and maintain.\u201d But Garen Wintemute, a professor at the University of California, Davis, and the director of California\u2019s firearms violence research center, said some of the data the justice department is now denying researchers had been previously shared with them for decades, and other data is specifically mandated to be shared with the gun violence research center under California law.  \u201cPeople have started to wonder what other reasons there might be for which privacy is a fig leaf,\u201d Wintemute said.     Xavier Becerra became California\u2019s attorney general in 2017, the same year, Garen Wintemute said, that problems began with firearms data access. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP    When California in 2016 created the firearms violence research center, America\u2019s first state-funded institution researching the topic, Wintemute was named its director, and the California legislature specified that the justice department and other state agencies would provide the center with the data it needed to study risk factors for firearms violence and the effectiveness of different prevention strategies. Wintemute said the center\u2019s problems with accessing firearms data access started in 2017, when Becerra became California\u2019s attorney general, and escalated in early 2020. \u201cThey\u2019re refusing to provide any detailed explanation. They\u2019re simply saying: you can\u2019t have the data,\u201d Wintemute said of the department\u2019s decisions. \u201cOne of the mysteries is why this is happening: the law has not changed.\u201d During a meeting with the justice department\u2019s research head and two staff attorneys last March, Wintemute said, he was told that \u201cthese decisions were being made by \u2018exec\u2019\u201d, which he interpreted as meaning Becerra and his deputy, Sean McCluskie, who was recently appointed the chief of staff for the federal Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cI think there is real grounds for concern that this sort of unethical approach to science is about to move to the head of health and human services, which is home to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some of the leading research institutes in the world,\u201d said Wintemute. In statements justifying the department\u2019s current policy, Becerra\u2019s office repeatedly cited a piece of new legislation drafted by Wintemute himself, which would mandate the Department of Justice provide data to researchers as evidence that the current law was ambiguous and needed to be clarified. Thedepartment of justice also pointed at Becerra\u2019s broader record on gun violence as attorney general, including his legal defense of California\u2019s attempt to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines, which is still being litigated, and his involvement in multiple lawsuits pushing for tougher regulation of \u201cghost guns\u201d. McCluskie and the health and human services department did not respond to requests for comment. Sarah Lovenheim, a former Becerra adviser, said in an emailed statement that \u201cAG Becerra has a strong track record on gun violence prevention and merely acted in keeping with state law.\u201d The standoff in California is worrying for public health experts nationwide, since previous data access in California has made kinds of studies possible that have not been conducted in other states. \u201cI consider it a pretty serious challenge to gun violence research,\u201d Daniel Webster, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, said. While some Republicans and gun rights activists have pushed back against public health research on guns for decades, \u201cI can\u2019t think of an example\u201d of another Democratic politician serving as a barrier to this kind of work, Webster said. In an editorial Tuesday, the Sacramento Bee, which first reported the news of the data dispute, blasted Becerra for \u201chiding gun violence data\u201d and accused him of \u201cobstructing\u201d, rather than upholding, state law. And three national organizations \u2013 Brady United Against Gun ViolenceGiffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence \u2013 have prepared comment opposing the new rules, with two of the groups arguing that they would \u201cobstruct the mission of policymakers in both California and other states hoping to save lives by passing the most effective laws.\u201d Some California pro-gun activists, on the other hand, have wondered whether Becerra\u2019s policy was motivated by a desire to \u201chide data\u201d that might show the policies he supported were ineffective.  \u201cBecerra\u2019s repeated unwillingness to share various types of information suggests he\u2019s more concerned about politics than truth. Is this latest cover-up an effort to hide data that reflects poorly on the effectiveness of his policies?\u201d Chuck Michel, the president of the California Rifle and Pistol Association, said in a statement. Even California lawyers are confused. John Hemmerling, an assistant city attorney in San Diego, said that the state department of justice\u2019s claims that the existing laws for dating sharing needed to be clarified did not make sense to him. \u201cI just can\u2019t figure out why they want to limit some of the data that\u2019s being released to a researcher like the University of California,\u201d he said. Wintemute, who was one of the public health experts whose federal research funding to study firearms issues was cut off after pressure from the National Rifle Association in the early 1990s, said the standoff felt strangely familiar. The behavior of California\u2019s justice department is \u201csimilar to what happened in the 1990s\u201d, Wintemute said, when Republicans responded to a taxpayer-funded study finding that gun ownership was linked to an increased risk of homicide in the home by making symbolic cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention budget and warning that federal public health funding could not be used to \u201cadvocate or promote gun control\u201d. \u201cWhatever the intent might be,\u201d he said, \u201cthe effect is to choke off research on an important problem.\u201d", "author": "Graham Readfearn and Daniel Hurst"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "\u2018For women, it\u2019s behind enemy lines!\u2019 Rob Beckett and Josh Widdicombe on their parenting podcast", "full_article": "Like many comedians, Josh Widdicombe and Rob Beckett found themselves without an outlet when the pandemic struck. And so, like many comedians, they decided to make a podcast. Theirs \u2013 Lockdown Parenting Hell \u2013 has become one of the most popular in the country, mining the stresses of everything from twins, tantrums and building a trampoline to the tune of more than 15m downloads. Beckett has two young children with his wife, Louise Watts, while Widdicome and his wife, Rose Hanson, have one, with another on the way. Each week, the pair interview a celebrity (past guests have included Michael Sheen, Philippa Perry and Paddy McGuinness) while sharing stories about their upended domestic lives. It is fast, fun and, at times, genuinely touching. Here, they share their thoughts on their pandemic pastime. Stuart Heritage: Shouldn\u2019t you be looking after your kids instead of doing a podcast?Rob Beckett: I think the podcast gives us a good excuse to not look after them. That was the main reason we did it, really, wasn\u2019t it? So that we can have a justifiable break from parenting. Josh Widdicombe: It\u2019s a way for us to go upstairs without feeling guilty about it. That was the whole elevator pitch for the podcast. RB: The podcast started because we\u2019d been texting each other, moaning about how hard lockdown was. It\u2019s a WhatsApp group that\u2019s got out of hand, essentially. It\u2019s also self-therapy for us. I was having a wobble and I think Josh quite enjoyed the fact that I had it worse, with one more kid than him. JW: Totally. It was the main thing getting me through. And I thought that other people would get some joy out of his pain. RB: But now Josh is expecting a second child, so the tables will turn.      Previous guests have included (from left) Philippa Perry, Jamelia and Michael Sheen. Composite: P\u00e5l Hansen/The Observer; Darren Staples/Getty Images    SH: Has Rob prepared you for the arrival of your second, Josh?JW: I\u2019m genuinely excited about it. Particularly because I think I\u2019ll be a lot more confident with the child. All that stuff about: \u2018How do you hold them?\u2019 \u2018How do you swaddle?\u2019 I\u2019m all right with that now, so I can actually enjoy having the child. But, conversely, I\u2019m heartbroken about how it\u2019ll coincide with the pubs reopening and the European championship [Euro 2020]. It\u2019s brutal. RB: I\u2019ll be constantly in the pub. The grandparents are desperate to see the kids and they\u2019re so easy to look after now, so I can just leave them with them. It\u2019s a completely guilt-free opportunity. SH: What have you learned about parenting in the past year?JW: I think I\u2019ve learned to chill out about it; that\u2019s the main thing. Learning that the \u201cbig moments\u201d \u2013 Christmas morning, the building of the snowman \u2013 are almost always not the big moment. But that\u2019s OK. Sometimes, it\u2019s enough to have a terrible time building a snowman. RB: You think: \u201cOh, when we go on this holiday, that will be the magical family moment,\u201d but instead you\u2019re blindsided by something that happens at one o\u2019clock on a Tuesday afternoon. I was away so much more before lockdown. I was working day and night. Classic poverty mindset: get all the money in before it goes away, work work work. My family life was dominated by grand gestures and big things. I\u2019d be like: \u201cI\u2019ve got three days off, so let\u2019s book somewhere.\u201d But I think I\u2019ve realised that the kids enjoy it just as much if you\u2019re hanging around with them and placing more emphasis on being there, rather than working hard to save money for a big Disney thing. They don\u2019t care, and just being with them is way more enjoyable for everyone. I\u2019m going to try to work less and have fewer things. JW: That\u2019s good, because it means there\u2019ll be more corporate gigs for other comics.     \u2018I\u2019m bored of Netflix, I want to do a gig, I don\u2019t want my kids in my house\u2019 ... Rob Beckett. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian    SH: Has lockdown changed your relationships with your partners?JW: I think it\u2019s made it much better, in that there\u2019s less pressure on our time together. I used to be working five nights a week, so it felt like a waste if, on that sixth night, we just watched The Repair Shop and looked at our phones. But you need that time together, that total write-off time. It\u2019s much more difficult to continue a relationship positively if, whenever you see each other, it\u2019s like: \u201cThis is date night.\u201d Maybe I didn\u2019t realise that until lockdown. RB: I didn\u2019t realise, and I don\u2019t think Lou [Beckett\u2019s wife since 2015] even realised, how much she was doing on her own. Before lockdown, I was working all day on TV shows and doing tour shows in the evening and I\u2019d been to LA, South Africa and Paris before January. I was never home and Lou had to do everything, which wasn\u2019t good for her or me. In my head, I\u2019m providing for my kids, but I\u2019m not providing as a husband or a dad. It can\u2019t just be a monetary support thing. SH: You\u2019ve said that the podcast has a predominantly female listenership \u2013 why do you think that is?RB: I feel like a lot of the female audience enjoy listening to men chat about parenting, because not a lot of men do. It\u2019s that whole thing of getting men to speak more, about mental health and stuff like that. Sometimes, the female audience quite likes trying to know what a bloke\u2019s thinking about. It\u2019s like spying behind enemy lines. JW: In terms of mental health and speaking about stuff, this has unknowingly really helped me deal with the last year. It is so useful to talk about these things. It\u2019s provided an outlet and, I think, for listeners it\u2019s the same. RB: And the listeners aren\u2019t even all mums. We\u2019ve got so many people that don\u2019t have kids, but everyone is either a parent or had parents. I do think people listen to try to piece together how their parents parented them, or how they would parent. A lot of grandparents listen, too, to remind them of what it was like when they had younger kids. It shocked us that the audience wasn\u2019t just parents of young kids. SH: Have you struggled with any aspects of lockdown?JW: I think I initially struggled with the idea that it was an opportunity. On the podcast, [the comedian] Ellie Taylor told us that her friend said \u201clockdown isn\u2019t a writer\u2019s retreat\u201d. I spent 10 years going: \u201cI would do that, but I\u2019ve got a gig,\u201d and then thought lockdown could have been my chance to write the great American novel. There was all that early pressure for lockdown to be a moment for everyone to find themselves, but actually it\u2019s just about getting through it. RB: I\u2019ve found lockdown three tough. We\u2019ve been locked down since November, then Lou had to shield for two or three months and that was really hard. It was cold and miserable and the kids got mad. I\u2019m bored of Netflix, I want to do a gig, I don\u2019t want my kids in my house. I want to get out and live my life.     \u2018My dad was basically an old hippy\u2019 ... Josh Widdicombe. Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Guardian    SH: Do you think dads have more trouble making new friends than mums?JW: I have struggled. We didn\u2019t make friends through NCT [a charity that provides support for expectant parents], because we did an extreme two-day course. The friends I\u2019ve got at the nursery gates are all mums, actually. I haven\u2019t made any new dad friends, beyond acquaintances. RB: It\u2019s a lucky dip. I think women are nicer and more empathic, so they will suffer a dickhead for longer, whereas I\u2019d just sack him off and do something on my own. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s me, or all men. What I\u2019ve learned is to just let Lou make friends and I\u2019ll pick the one with the bloke I get on best with, and that\u2019s our new double date. JW: So she does a shortlist and then you pick a winner? SH: Do you listen to other parenting podcasts?JW: I\u2019ve listened to Chris and Rosie Ramsey\u2019s podcast [Sh**ged Married Annoye\u202ad] occasionally. RB: I mainly listen to boxing and football ones. JW: I listen to podcasts about unsolved murders and paranormal activity. I\u2019ve just listened to two documentary series about Robert Maxwell. In many ways, they act as interesting parenting podcasts. SH: Does your approach to parenting differ from how your dads parented you?JW: My dad was basically an old hippy. He grew up in the 60s, so I had a very laid-back childhood. There was no pressure to do well at school or do a certain job \u2013 I\u2019d hope that would be the thing I take from that. But then I\u2019m a more uptight person than my dad, so that probably comes through. RB: I\u2019m more hands-on than my dad was. He was a long-distance lorry driver and a cab driver, so he worked mad hours and we wouldn\u2019t see him much. I don\u2019t remember him picking me up from school that much, because that\u2019s when he worked. But that was more due to money than, you know, him just really loving driving. He loves us to pieces, but he had to earn the money, so he wasn\u2019t there. I have that same mentality, which nearly led me to burnout before Covid. But now I\u2019ve realised that it\u2019s more productive to work less and be there more. It\u2019s a learning curve. You only act in the way you\u2019ve seen, so it\u2019s hard. SH: How were your homes growing up?JW: I didn\u2019t really get told off when I was a kid, but that\u2019s a combination of my dad being laid-back and me being a dweeb. It was kind of a perfect storm, in that sense. There was also a lot of taking the piss; that was a big deal in our house. I would want my children to grow up in a house that was a laugh; I would hate for it to be a sterile atmosphere. RB: Our house was brutal, to the point where it was too much. My brother had acne on his back, so his nickname was Dartboard Back. My brother Joe had smelly breath for about half an hour and got called Dogshit Breath for ever. I was called Jaffa Cake Nips because I had fat nipples through puberty. My mum used to call it The House of No Compassion. It shocked me when I went on Mock the Week and everyone said: \u201cThey\u2019re all really intimidating.\u201d What? My house is much worse than this. SH: Where does Lockdown Parenting Hell go when lockdown ends?RB: I\u2019ll shake off Josh and take all the earnings. JW: But he says I can come on as an interview guest. RB: We genuinely started it because we thought it would be fun to do, but last week it was the top podcast in the country. I feel like now we\u2019ve built a little community, so I would love to carry it on. It\u2019s a journey that we need to carry on as our kids grow up. JW: I remember at one point panicking, wondering if my daughter would hate me for it, but then I realised that the whole thing is really positive. I love the idea of a document that she can go back and discover when she\u2019s older, combined with interviews with people that she won\u2019t have heard of. RB: I feel like it\u2019s made me a better parent, because we\u2019re talking to Philippa Perry and all these people who have older children. JW: I think it\u2019s made me a way better comedian, too, because I\u2019ve never given much of myself to comedy in terms of revealing my personal life. But the success of this has taught me that the more honest you are, the funnier you are. On Sunday, I was in my car, stuck at this red light for five minutes, and people were honking at me to jump the light. And, yeah, I was stressed, but I was also thinking: \u201cThis is going to be great for the podcast.\u201d Josh Widdicombe hosts Hypothetical at 10pm on Wednesdays on Dave", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "GMB staff complained about Piers Morgan's Meghan comments ", "full_article": " Multiple staff on Good Morning Britain made complaints to senior managers about Piers Morgan\u2019s comments on the Duchess of Sussex before he quit the show, the Guardian understands. Morgan\u2019s departure from the programme followed the announcement of 41,000 complaints to the regulator Ofcom over remarks on Monday which cast doubt on Meghan\u2019s statement that she had been denied help with mental health issues. Meghan\u2019s representatives also complained on her behalf to ITV, with the substance of the complaint understood to have focused on how Morgan\u2019s comments would affect others dealing with mental health problems. Now, sources within the show\u2019s editorial and production staff have described how dozens of people inside Good Morning Britain were also uncomfortable about his intervention, with some making complaints. \u201cEveryone is used to Piers saying things like this, but Meghan had literally said that the media wasn\u2019t treating her fairly because of who she is, and he was just doing it again,\u201d said one. Another said that management\u2019s attitude changed after Morgan walked off set when he was confronted by weather presenter Alex Beresford on Tuesday morning, and with an Ofcom investigation pending. \u201cThey felt that they had to be seen on the \u2018morally right side of the argument,\u2019\u201d they said. \u201cPiers wouldn\u2019t back down and had to go.\u201d Others within the programme characterised the opposition to Morgan as \u201cvery much generational\u201d. One said: \u201cThere has been a bit of a culture clash but it\u2019s about that, not about his treatment of people.\u201d Beresford had not been scheduled to appear on the show on Tuesday but was drafted in from his other role on ITV West Country to add a \u201cbalance of views\u201d after he tweeted critically about Morgan\u2019s statements on Monday, it is understood. ITV declined to comment. On Tuesday it said Morgan had \u201cdecided now is the time to leave Good Morning Britain\u201d and \u201cITV has accepted this decision\u201d. Morgan is understood to have quit after a clash with ITV executives because he refused to apologise for casting doubt on Meghan\u2019s interview with Oprah Winfrey. He had reasoned that his clarification on Tuesday that \u201cit\u2019s not for me to question if she felt suicidal, I am not in her mind and that is for her to say\u201d was sufficient to emphasise that he was not referring to the state of her mental health. On Wednesday he told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t believe almost anything that comes out of her mouth \u2026 If I have to fall on my sword for expressing an honestly held opinion about Meghan Markle and that diatribe of bilge that she came out with in that interview, so be it.\u201d Later, former BBC presenter Andrew Neil said he wanted to talk to Morgan about a role on the soon-to-launch right-leaning news channel GB News. \u201cI think Piers Morgan would be a great asset to GB News and we\u2019ll certainly talk to him about it. I think he needs a little period of quiet reflection before anything happens. And I wouldn\u2019t simply transfer what he did at GMB straight to GB News, I think we\u2019d probably want to do something a bit different,\u201d Neil told BBC Radio 4. Neil said he would not want \u201cany shouting, or ranting, or raving\u201d on the new channel but that Morgan\u2019s controversies helped ITV\u2019s ratings challenge those of BBC Breakfast. Morgan\u2019s longtime co-presenter Susanna Reid addressed his absence on Wednesday morning, telling viewers that they \u201cdisagreed on many things\u201d including his remarks on Meghan, and describing him as an \u201coutspoken, challenging, opinionated, disruptive broadcaster\u201d. \u201cIt is certainly going to be very different but shows go on and so on we go,\u201d she said. If Reid\u2019s remarks were carefully phrased, some behind the scenes took a more negative view of Morgan\u2019s time on the programme, painting a picture of a figure with disproportionate control over the on-air agenda. One said the last six years had been an \u201cexhilarating and exhausting experience\u201d, adding: \u201cManagement lost complete control of Piers years ago \u2013 once the on-air sign flashed up above the studio door he was making all decisions. Editorial and gallery team had no clue what was coming next, or any real ability to shape the output once the programme had gone live.\u201d They said that when concerns were raised with senior management about that pattern, \u201cyou\u2019d be told there was nothing that could be done. Not to worry they would say, he won\u2019t be there forever\u201d. A senior source acknowledged he had \u201cstrong opinions\u201d but denied he had editorial control and said: \u201cMany of the team do have a lot of respect for how he helped raise the game of the show with exclusives and leading on big issues like the pandemic, he was a brilliant force.\u201d One staffer said that they complained to a manager over Monday\u2019s broadcast. \u201cI haven\u2019t ever done that before [because] I think a lot of what\u2019s said about him is exaggerated by people who view him as a useful bogeyman,\u201d they said. \u201cAlso he\u2019s been a brilliant interviewer on coronavirus. But I had friends asking me what he was thinking and I felt embarrassed to work here for the first time.\u201d Another source close to the show said that they were aware of complaints from \u201cmany, many staff\u201d over Morgan\u2019s remarks. There had been \u201cunease\u201d over some of Morgan\u2019s positions for months, the source said. Viewing figures revealed that GMB had beaten its BBC rival for the first time on Morgan\u2019s final day, with 1.29m viewers against 1.25m for BBC Breakfast. Morgan tweeted: \u201cBREAKING NEWS: Good Morning Britain beat BBC Breakfast in the ratings yesterday for the first time. My work is done.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 March 2021 because an earlier version said that \u201cMeghan\u2019s representatives also complained on her behalf to Ofcom\u201d over Morgan\u2019s remarks.

But in reality Marilyn Monroe was in turmoil: a marriage falling apart, chronic insecurity and a debilitating dependency on alcohol and pills. The picture is one of a series of unpublished photographs of Monroe from the set of her final completed film, seen here for the first time. Taken by Eve Arnold, Monroe\u2019s friend and one of the most admired and distinctive photographers of the 20th century, they show someone who is extraordinarily beautiful and instantly recognisable, but also normal and vulnerable. \u201cThere is something about the one where she\u2019s in the car,\u201d said Michael Arnold, Eve\u2019s grandson who manages the family archive. \u201cIt\u2019s not the typical glamour shot you often see with Monroe, there\u2019s an ordinariness about it \u2026 she is going about her craft, she\u2019s learning her lines. There\u2019s something about the composition which makes it special.\u201d The 15 images are being released by the estate to help fulfil the wishes of Arnold for her work to be a kind of affordable, accessible folk art. Buying an Arnold print would normally cost more than \u00a31,000. The new images are being offered for \u00a330 as posters. In another one Monroe is more whimsical, according to Michael Arnold. There is a similar pensiveness but she is aware she\u2019s being photographed and is playing up to it.     Marilyn Monroe learning her lines during the filming of The Misfits, 1960. Photograph: Eve Arnold/Magnum Photos    It is from the set of the 1961 film The Misfits, which was, to say the least, a troubled production. The film was written by Arthur Miller, a titanic playwright but an inexperienced film writer, as a valentine for Monroe, his wife. A dream team was assembled including John Huston as director and the actors Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift. At the time it was the most expensive black and white film ever made. Huston was often drunk, falling asleep on set in the searing heat of the Nevada desert. Monroe, whose marriage to Miller was falling apart, woke up groggy most days and was late all the time. The Misfits was the last completed film for Gable and Monroe, and a commercial failure, probably better regarded today than it was at the time. \u201c[Monroe] confided in Eve that she was struggling, she was finding it difficult to come to terms with the image that everybody had created of her, she was exhausted at having to live up to that,\u201d said Michael Arnold. When Eve Arnold died in London in 2012, aged 99, it was front-page news. Born in Philadelphia, she became a photographer in her 40s and was the first woman to join the Magnum photographic agency. She photographed the rich and famous and the down-at-heel. Robert Capa, a co-founder of Magnum, once described her work as falling \u201cbetween Marlene Dietrich\u2019s legs and the bitter lives of migratory potato pickers\u201d. Michael Arnold had a touchingly close relationship with Eve. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t really a granny type of granny, she was just a really cool woman that was like a friend and mentor to me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe always had so many stories to tell and she would very rarely tell the same story twice.\u201d When he took over managing her archive he came across a quote in which his grandmother said: \u201cI would prefer photography to be a folk art \u2013 cheap and available to everybody, rather than elevated to mandarin proportions created through an artificial scarcity.\u201d That triggered memories of a story about her first London show when Arnold wanted students to be able to afford her work and so she sold prints at hugely reduced prices. Later on she would discover that art dealers had bought them to sell for a profit.     Fisherman and family, 1954. Photograph: Eve Arnold/Magnum Photos    From there came the poster plan, which he hopes will help preserve her legacy and introduce his grandmother\u2019s work to new generations. \u201cThe themes she photographed are ever-present, if not more so \u2013 racism, sexism, inequality \u2026 not to mention the humanity she brought to her work.\u201d Michael said Eve was groundbreaking. One of the first subjects she chose to cover was black fashion shows in Harlem, a vibrant world almost totally ignored by the media. Her images were picked up by Picture Post and went around the world. Other images being released as posters reflect the diversity of Arnold\u2019s career: a Mongolian girl at one with her horse; a training session for civil rights activists on how not to react to provocation during sit-ins; and a Cuban fisher joyously spending time with his family. Michael Arnold said his grandmother grew up as one of nine children in a poor Russian Jewish immigrant family. \u201cShe didn\u2019t talk about this much but it definitely had a bearing on her desire to make photography accessible to all.\u201d Arnold\u2019s output is still largely an untapped mine, given she took around 250,000 photographs in her career. Only around 2,000-3,000 have been digitised.

The judge, Gillian Ellis, ruled that the children from Sussex be taken into long-term foster care. She described the case as \u201cvery sad and unusual\u201d. Social services staff at West Sussex county council had told a family court judge about their concerns. The local authority had provided Fitbits (fitness trackers) and paid for gym membership for the family, who had also signed up to Weight Watchers. But Ellis said months after family court proceedings began there had been no reduction in the children\u2019s weight, and they had not provided recordings from their Fitbits or attended the Weight Watchers appointments consistently. The judge said the children\u2019s parents not seemed to understand the seriousness of concerns raised by social services staff and had failed to set boundaries and promote healthy eating and exercise. She said the children needed the chance to \u201clearn ways of living more healthily\u201d and to improve their health by losing weight. The judge said there were also concerns about poor home conditions and a lack of guidance on personal care. \u201cEveryone agrees that this is a very sad and unusual case, of a loving family, where the parents meet many of the basic needs of the children, but the local authority has been concerned that the parents are not meeting the children\u2019s health needs, in that both children are severely overweight, and the parents have shown an inability to help the children manage this condition,\u201d said the judge in her ruling. She added: \u201cThe case was such an unusual one because the children had clearly had some very good parenting, as they were polite, bright, and engaging.\u201d  Detail of the case emerged in a ruling by Ellis published online on Wednesday. She had considered evidence at a private family court hearing in Sussex last year. The family could not be identified in media reports of the case. Ellis added: \u201cThe children had failed to engage consistently in exercise despite the local authority providing Fitbits and paying for gym membership. The children were supposed to provide recordings from their Fitbits, but this had not been done. The mother blamed lockdown for the inability to exercise, but exercise could still be taken in the home or by walking outside. The attendance of the family at Weight Watchers had been inconsistent.\u201d In 2012, a five-year-old girl was taken into care after her weight reached 66kg (10st 5lbs), more than three times the weight of a healthy child her age.

While the document raises concerns about pollution caused by wood-fired heaters in regional areas, its most ambitious proposal is for a plan to \u201charmonise\u201d the state\u2019s vehicle emissions regulations with European standards and encourage the uptake of electric vehicles. The New South Wales minister for environment, Matt Kean, declined to comment about any specifics as the strategy was still subject to cabinet processes.   Related: 'Do-nothing document': Australian electric vehicle strategy lets emissions keep rising    \u201cAny changes NSW proposes to the national vehicle emission standards would only apply to new cars that are already available overseas. More importantly, cleaner vehicles are more fuel efficient, saving motorists money at the bowser,\u201d Kean said. \u201cI will always advocate for policies to stop NSW being used as a dumping ground for the world\u2019s dirtiest vehicles.\u201d While the plans have yet to be officially released in their final form, any New South Wales push to pass CO2 emissions standards may force the hand of the federal government. The move signals an evolving states-based approach on the issue of fuel efficiency and emissions regulations after decades of inaction by federal Labor and Liberal governments. After four years of consultation, the Morrison government released its \u201cfuture fuels\u201d strategy paper in February that was immediately slammed as a \u201cdo nothing\u201c document for rejecting stricter fuel efficiency standards. Should Victoria follow suit and introduce a plan to harmonise its fuel efficiency and emissions regulations with Europe, the country\u2019s two largest regional economies would be covered by a stricter regulatory standard than that at a federal level.

Australia\u2019s loose attitude on noxious and CO2 emissions has made the country an outlier within the global vehicle market. Thanks to the regulatory black hole the country has become a dumping ground for thirsty petrol and diesel vehicles that are becoming increasingly difficult to sell elsewhere. The idea of state governments acting independently met a mixed response from industry bodies such as the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries. Its chief, Tony Weber, said that his organisation supported stricter emissions and fuel quality standards for Australian vehicles, but leaving it up to the states risked creating a patchwork of regulations across the country that would be bad for business. \u201cIn an ideal world we would have a CO2 target,\u201d Weber said. \u201cWe believe there should be a CO2 target and that it should be at a national level. \u201cWe can\u2019t have every state and territory going off on a whim. This needs to be handled at a federal level. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put in a voluntary standard for our members which represents the manufacturers of 99% of vehicles sold in this country.\u201d His comments were echoed by the Australian Automotive Dealer Association chief executive, James Voortman, who said it was up to the federal government to ensure a consistent standard. \u201cI can\u2019t blame the NSW government for doing this if they think this is the right way to go,\u201d Voortman said. \u201cThe question of fuel efficiency standards has been looked at by Labor governments, Liberal governments and for a number of reasons they\u2019ve decided not to act. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the manufacturers themselves have signed up to a voluntary vehicle emissions standard. \u201cSo it\u2019s something our manufacturers support and it\u2019s something dealers support, and we\u2019re increasingly noticing that it\u2019s something customers want.

The woman had been distressed by what sounded like the thrashing of wings, in a field behind a tall hedge up at the top of the lane. I had an idea. The day was murky and damp but celandines and primroses in the hedgebank cancelled out the chill. From the lane, an instinctively animal sound \u2013 a panicky banging against something hard \u2013 could be heard. It might have been a trapped bird and it felt urgent enough to do something about, so there was a compulsion to trespass. There was a way into the field through a little copse around a spring head, over a wire fence and then over a stile. The tattered pennants of maize plants were still in rows; they were last year\u2019s cover crop for pheasants, who were attracted there by feeding stations. During a shoot, birds seeking refuge in the maize would be beaten, scared into the air, to fly towards the guns. It was one of those places that felt wrong.     One of the pheasants observed in Wenlock Edge. Photograph: Maria Nunzia @Varvera    Two or three hen pheasants rocketed away from the plastic drum feeders and a couple of cocks ran for cover. Beneath the feeders the ground was smoothed, flat as a dancefloor. Checking there was not a bird in distress or trapped inside the feed drum, I came to the realisation of what was going on. The pheasants were aware that, even though feeding had stopped months ago, there was still some seed inside the drum. They could get underneath and flap hard to put their heads through the hole \u2013 and the beating of their wings would also loosen some of the seeds inside, which then would fall through the hole for them to eat. I like pheasants. It\u2019s not their fault that millions of them are reared in captivity and released into the countryside every year to be shot or run over. It\u2019s not their fault they have a devastating impact on reptiles, amphibians and other wildlife. Pheasants are learning survival skills, turning the system that exploits them to their advantage.

But this week, unprecedented barriers on every form of digital content, from online news to social media and films and television on streaming platforms, came into force, making India\u2019s digital realm one of the most heavily regulated of any major democracy. The series of sweeping new IT rules bring almost everything that happens online under a mechanism of government regulation, including giving the government powers to remove \u201cobjectionable\u201d online content and erasing people\u2019s right to privacy on social media and encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp. The move has provoked a huge backlash among the world of tech and media and a legal challenge against the rules was raised in Delhi high court this week by several online publishers.   Related: Indian journalists face criminal charges over police shooting reports    \u201cThe new rules take democracy and free speech in a very alarming direction, all under the guise of promoting online safety and making India more secure,\u201d said Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Centre for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School. With tech companies now ordered by the government to proactively monitor what people say on their platforms \u2013 and keep data on the identity of those users which could then be handed over to the government on demand \u2013 Pfefferkorn said it would \u201cexert a chilling effect on what people are willing to say and do online if they know they\u2019re being watched.\u201d \u201cProviders are being pressed to take down content the Indian government deems illegal or a threat to India\u2019s security \u2013 categories that now seem to include criticising the Modi government,\u201d she said. A crackdown on dissent The government has insisted that the new rules level the playing field, and regulate online content in the same way as traditional newspapers, television and film. A press note accompanying the announcement of the rules called them \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cliberal\u201d. \u201cWe want them to be more responsible, more accountable,\u201d said IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad of digital platforms. Yet even India\u2019s mainstream media, which is rarely outspoken against the government, expressed concern, an editorial in The Hindu newspaper called the new rules \u201ca wolf in watchdog\u2019s clothing\u201d and described them as \u201cdeeply unsettling as they will end up giving the government a good deal of leverage over online news publishers and intermediaries\u201d. The Editors Guild of India put out a damning statement over the weekend which said the rules \u201cfundamentally alter how publishers of news operate over the internet and have the potential to seriously undermine media freedom in India\u201d. Many see the rules as a continuation of Modi\u2019s government authoritarian crackdown on dissent. Freedom of the press and freedom of expression has been heavily curtailed since Modi\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power, with mainstream media largely within the government\u2019s grasp, but it is online news platforms who have become one of the last bastions of independent journalism. Social media, such as Twitter, is also used as a vital organising and information tool for anti-government actions, such as the huge farmers\u2019 protests which have been going on in India since November. In turn, the government has attempted to control the platforms, by demanding for example that Twitter remove thousands of accounts critical of the government and threatening their staff with arrest if the company did not comply.

This year, for the third year in a row, India topped the global list for most internet shutdowns, according to digital rights group Access Now. Of the 155 internet shutdowns that happened around the world in 2020, 109 of them were in India. \u2018Palpably illegal\u2019 The rules will fundamentally change how big tech companies like Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, and Twitter, operate in India, one of the world\u2019 largest and most lucrative markets. So far the tech companies have remained quiet on whether they will comply, but internet company Mozilla said the \u201cripple effects of these provisions will have a devastating impact on freedom of expression, privacy and security\u201d. \u201cThey call these rules self-regulation,\u201d said Prasanth Sugathan, legal director at the Software Freedom Law Centre. \u201cBut when you have a regulatory mechanism that ultimately ends with a government body who can remove any content that it decides is problematic \u2013 perhaps because it is critical of the government \u2013 then that self-regulation can quickly turn into state censorship,\u201d Indian digital news platforms The Wire.in and The News Minute are among those who have challenged the IT rules in court this week, in a petition presented to the Delhi high court, arguing they are \u201cpalpably illegal\u201d. Siddharth Varadarajan, Editor of TheWire, described the rules as an \u201coppressive architecture\u201d, which, by giving the government the power to delete or modify content, granted them \u201cpowers that run counter to the constitutional guarantee of press freedom.\u201d \u201cWe have argued that this runs the danger of adversely affecting fundamental rights,\u201d said Dhanya Rajendran, editor of the News Minute.

Since 2013, a team of more than a dozen researchers have been investigating the site of La Almoloya in the southern Spanish region of Murcia. Home to the El Argar, a society that was among the first to utilise bronze, build complex urban centres and develop into a state organisation, the site is part of a vast territory that at its peak stretched across 35,000 sq km. Research published on Thursday in the journal Antiquity has documented one of the site\u2019s most tantalising finds: a man and a woman buried in a large ceramic jar, both of whom died close together in the mid-17th century BC.     The remains of a man and a woman in a large ceramic jar have been found at La Almoloya. Photograph: Cambridge University Press    Buried with them were 29 valuable objects, nearly all of them belonging to the female, believed to be between 25 and 30 years of age. \u201cIt\u2019s like everything she touched had silver on it,\u201d said Cristina Rihuete of the Autonomous University of Barcelona. Among the exquisitely crafted items were bracelets, rings and a rare type of crown, known as a diadem. In total 230 grams of silver were found at the burial site \u2013 an amount that at the time would have been worth the equivalent of 938 daily wages. The prominent role women may have played in the society is echoed in other finds at El Argar; similar diadems were found at four other female burial sites while gravesites of women were later used for the burials of elite warriors, suggesting these sites were viewed as places of high status.     A bronze age ear plug and spiral found at La Almoloya in Murcia. Photograph: Cambridge University Press    What made this most recent find unique was its location beneath what could be the first bronze age palace unearthed in the region. As the building would have been used for political purposes, it could be that the woman\u2019s power stemmed from politics, said Rihuete. Men were probably the warriors of society, as suggested by the swords found at several male burial sites, said Roberto Risch of Autonomous University of Barcelona. \u201cClearly they control the means of violence and they are probably behind the expansion of El Argar.\u201d   Related: Islamic 12th-century bathhouse uncovered in Seville tapas bar    The society, which thrived from 2200BC onwards, was highly organised with a wealthy elite that was probably sustained by some sort of tax system. \u201cIn western Europe there was nothing of the like,\u201d said Risch, pointing to the rest of Spain where people at the time were living in self-sufficient communities of 50 to 100 people. By the 16th century BC, all of El Argar\u2019s settlements were abandoned, believed to have been racked by internal uprisings. \u201cShortly after the woman dies, the whole settlement is burned down,\u201d said Risch. \u201cAnd not until the Greeks and Phoenicians arrive on the Iberian peninsula did we see anything similar, either in architecture or in political dimension.\u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Indigenous leaders accuse ACT of trying to cover up strip-search of sexual assault survivor", "full_article": "Indigenous leaders have accused the Australian Capital Territory of trying to cover up the alleged forcible strip-searching of a sexual assault survivor by having footage of the episode suppressed. On Wednesday the ACT government sent lawyers to the bail hearing of a 37-year-old Indigenous woman, who alleges she was forcibly strip-searched by guards in full riot gear in the territory\u2019s jail, the Alexander Maconochie centre, this year. The government\u2019s lawyers successfully argued to have footage of the strip-searching kept from public view, saying it may cause reprisal attacks on the guards. The woman, meanwhile, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly as a result of the ordeal. She has a serious heart condition, of which prison authorities were forewarned, and was stripped in front of male detainees, despite being a sexual assault survivor.   Related: Aboriginal man died from asthma attack after 'unreasonably delayed' response from prison staff    Guardian Australia understands that the woman wants the footage made public. On Thursday the ACT\u2019s Aboriginal health service, Winnunga Nimmityjah, condemned the territory\u2019s suppression of the footage. Julie Tongs, Winnunga\u2019s chief executive, accused the government of a cover-up. \u201cThe incident involving the strip search of this extremely vulnerable, traumatised Aboriginal woman, with serious health issues and a survivor of rape should be a catalyst for change, not a cover-up,\u201d she said. \u201cThis incident demands, as a minimum an independent, external investigation. Nothing else will satisfy the Aboriginal community or any fair-minded person concerned to ensure that Aboriginal peoples are treated fairly and equally. As a first step, if the ACT government really does have nothing to hide, release the CCTV.\u201d An ACT government spokesperson said the incident was \u201cvery serious\u201d and had been thoroughly reviewed by ACT Corrective Services. The corrections minister, Mick Gentleman, has already referred the incident to the inspector of correctional services to ensure an independent review takes place. \u201cThese allegations have also been brought to the attention of the Human Rights Commission,\u201d the spokesperson said. The ACT supreme court justice Michael Elkaim denied the woman bail, and suppressed his reasons for doing so until after her trial. That decision came despite an argument from her lawyers, Ken Cush &amp; Associates, that she would comply with strict bail conditions and that her circumstances had changed, given the strip-searching and subsequent PTSD diagnosis. The woman said she was struggling with the death of grandmother in the lead-up to the incident and that she had initially been told she would be released to attend the funeral. But that permission was revoked at the last-minute, she says, causing her to become \u201cvery upset\u201d. She says prison authorities tried to move her to a restricted unit in the jail but she was distressed at the prospect of going back into isolation. \u201cHere I ask you to remember that I am a rape victim, so you can only imagine the horror, the screams, the degrading feeling, the absolute fear and shame I was experiencing,\u201d she wrote in a letter recounting the ordeal. The ACT\u2019s jail was built with the intention of being human rights compliant. Critics say it has failed comprehensively in that aim. Winnunga points to the territory\u2019s high Indigenous incarceration rate as one indicator of this failing. The ACT\u2019s Indigenous incarceration rate is now the highest in the country, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are 19.4 times more likely to go to prison than the general community. With respect to the suppressed footage, Tongs said \u201cwhat you will see is horrible and it will reveal the government not just for its hypocrisy but the extent of its failure to take seriously the needs of the Aboriginal community of Canberra\u201d.

Fifteen pension and investment funds, led by the campaign group ShareAction, have agreed to withdraw their own environment resolution ahead of HSBC\u2019s annual general meeting on 28 May. The investor group \u2013 which included Europe\u2019s largest asset manager, Amundi, and Man Group, one of the world\u2019s biggest publicly-listed hedge funds \u2013 put pressure on the bank HSBC to reduce those loans and underwriting services offered to clients that relied heavily on fossil fuels. The timeline for action was to be consistent with Paris climate goals. HSBC\u2019s vote will be binding if it gains the approval of 75% of shareholders. The bank is Europe\u2019s second largest financier of fossil fuels after Barclays, according to the Rainforest Action Network (RAN). While HSBC recently pledged to shrink its carbon footprint to net zero by 2050, the plan stopped short of a blanket ban on financing coal power. The new special resolution put forward by its board will commit HSBC to phasing out financing for coal-fired power and thermal coal mining across the EU and OECD by 2030, and across the world by 2040. A full policy will be published at the end of the year and progress reports will be released annually, including details of the bank\u2019s methodology. HSBC is promising to use climate scenarios that do not project reduced emissions achieved by technologies that claim to remove carbon from the atmosphere. HSBC would be the first mainstream bank to exclude these so-called negative emissions technologies from its calculations.

But according to one report, it is likely New Zealand officials will eventually escort her from Turkey, along with her two children, aged two and five. Aden was arrested in mid-February trying to enter Turkey from Syria. Her detention triggered a diplomatic row when it emerged that Australia had stripped the 26-year-old of her Australian citizenship, leaving New Zealand to deal with her predicament. Born in New Zealand but having lived in Australia since she was six, Aden travelled to Syria on an Australian passport in 2014. Alleged to be involved with Isis, her Australian passport was cancelled in 2020. The timing of her actual loss of citizenship is less clear.   Related: Ardern blasts Morrison for shirking responsibility for suspected Isis terrorist who grew up in Australia    Media coverage has largely centred on New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s accusation that, in stripping Aden of her citizenship, Australia has \u201cabdicated its responsibilities\u201d. Ardern was right. But what has been less well covered is how the Australian government disabled itself from making a decision \u2013 let alone an informed one \u2013 on that loss of citizenship. Aden lost her citizenship automatically under a now-repealed law. That law deprived her of her citizenship without any Australian official evaluating her circumstances. An automatic rule Introduced under Tony Abbott\u2019s prime ministership, the powers of citizenship deprivation were enacted in December 2015, early in the Malcolm Turnbull government. Automatic loss of Australian citizenship could occur if:  The person was aged over 14 They would not be rendered stateless (Aden\u2019s New Zealand co-citizenship ensured this) They had either fought for a declared terrorist organisation or engaged in \u201cdisallegient\u201d conduct (defined with reference to various terrorist offences, though not incorporating key elements of those offences)  A person lost their Australian citizenship the instant the statutory conditions were met, irrespective of any official knowing this had occurred. Of course, officials could only act when they found out the relevant conditions had been met \u2013 but that might be years later, if ever. So, for example, a person could be denied a passport on the basis they no longer had citizenship. But a person\u2019s loss of citizenship did not wait on any official action or decision. The Australian government adopted these \u201cautomatic\u201d mechanisms in part to avoid any \u201cdecision\u201d being subject to judicial review. Legally, it is harder to challenge an automatic statutory change to a person\u2019s rights or status than one decided by an official. As the Australian independent national security legislation monitor (INSLM) put it, those statutory provisions lacked \u201cthe traditional and desirable accountability which comes from a person taking responsibility for making a reviewable decision\u201d. That lack of accountability was the point. No national security assessment As the INSLM heard during hearings in June 2019, the Australian government did not necessarily know who had lost their Australian citizenship or when. This considerably complicated the counter-terrorism work of Australian police and intelligence services. The INSLM found the uncertainty created by an automatic procedure might impede criminal prosecutions or cause them to fail. Responding to Ardern\u2019s criticisms, Scott Morrison argued it was his job \u201cto put Australia\u2019s national security interests first\u201d.   Related: Peter Dutton's push to use 'secret evidence' to revoke citizenship condemned    The problem was, no national security assessment had preceded Aden\u2019s loss of citizenship. The statute neither required nor allowed for any contextualised assessment of a person\u2019s circumstances or the broader implications of depriving them of citizenship. The first job of the relevant Australian officials was to mop up \u2013 to find out as best they could what the statute had already done, to whom and when. A failed policy Discussing the prospect of terrorist fighters leaving a conflict zone and returning to Australia, the Department of Home Affairs observed:  In managing the risk presented by these individuals to Australia\u2019s safety and security, a suite of measures, that are sufficiently nuanced and can be applied on a case-by-case basis, is paramount.  The provisions that deprived Aden of her citizenship emphatically failed to deliver on this policy objective. None of this is to say the Australian government\u2019s hands were tied. Even under the now-defunct legislative provisions that provided for an automatic process, the home affairs minister had the power \u201cat any time\u201d to make a determination to \u201cexempt the person from the effect\u201d of the automatic citizenship deprivation provisions. The Australian government belatedly responded to the counterproductive consequences of the \u201cautomatic\u201d process by repealing the relevant provisions and replacing them with a model based on ministerial decision. But by the time those amendments came into force in September last year, Aden had lost her Australian citizenship and New Zealand was her only legal home.

That reaction coursed throughout the four episodes made available for critics of Generation \u2013 an ambitious but muddled, often cringeworthy show that frequently mistakes shock or bluntness for subversion. The 16-part series (the second batch of eight episodes will air on HBO Max later this year) attempts to transpose the usual teen-show markers \u2013 hookups, unrequited crushes, drug experimentation, oppressive parents \u2013 to the social media and image-saturated late 2010s. The flurry of pop culture references and internet slang belie input from a real teenager; Zelda Barnz was 17 years old when the series was picked up. (Her father Daniel Barnz\u2019s writing-directing credits include 2014 Jennifer Aniston indie Cake and Beastly). But the show\u2019s shaky, unnecessarily Bourne-esque direction, over-reliance on \u201cartsy\u201d shots (multiple underwater cams) and broad strokes writing frequently undercut its ambition.              Of the four previews, the first and fourth unspool in shifting perspectives to build up tension, a hollow trick that muddies an already confusing web of characters. At the center appears to be Chester, a queer, brashly confident water polo star whose no-fucks wardrobe (tiny sunglasses, bleached hair, crop tops) overcompensates for Smith\u2019s overacting. Chester hangs out with Riley, an aspiring photographer from a rich family, who tries to set up Nathan, reeling from his dalliance (read: Snapchat dick pics) with sister Naomi\u2019s boyfriend, with Chester. Naomi frets about blowjobs with Arianna (Nathanya Alexander), who theatrically rebels, with consistently the most disingenuous lines, against her two fathers (John Ross Bowie and J August Richards). There is a subplot involving Nathan and Naomi\u2019s conservative, religious parents (Martha Plimpton and Sam Trammell); and it will not be surprising that in a later episode, Plimpton\u2019s character bemoans kids these days and their pronouns as a way of seeking attention. Each episode opens with an in medias res gimmick: a scene set three months ahead of the rest of the first episode, that tries to wring off-kilter humor and intrigue out of a bizarre predicament in a mall food court (teens still go there, I guess?). The whole bit would be laughably obscene would the situation not be so deeply traumatic in real life. It\u2019s perhaps unfair but impossible not to compare Generation to Euphoria, its glittery, hyper-dramatic half-hour cousin. Both strive for relevance to today\u2019s teens with in-your-face imagery (in Euphoria, full-frontal nudity and graphic depictions of drug addiction; in Generation, dick pics), frequent depictions of texting/sexting, and a baseline assumption of sexual and gender fluidity. But whereas Euphoria drew fans for its deceptive depth, especially the groundbreaking, organic relationship between trans teen Jules, played by Hunter Schafer, and Zendaya\u2019s Rue, Generation rings hollow, its characters more woke-signalling pieces on a ludicrous plot board than reflections of real people.      There are a few bright spots. Haley Sanchez, as Greta, gives one of the few convincing performances as a Latina teen in a family separated by inhumane US immigration laws, jittery and consumed by her unrequited crush on Riley. It\u2019s refreshing to see a show incorporate Gen Z staples such as text flirtations and Snapchat without much fanfare, even if said incorporation slides into grating lines. And the handling of sexual and gender fluidity as a casual, baseline assumption, rather than a major plot point, should be a standard for teen shows going forward. But the performative over-emphasis on self-conscious progressivism, with lines that make a woke joke out of asshole behavior (\u201cIn no way am I paying 10 cents for these \u2013 reparations!\u201d Arianna shouts while stealing cups from a lemonade stand), play like a callous shield for underdeveloped storytelling, no matter how good their intention. I am here for young people getting an opportunity to produce their work, for casts that are diverse and more queer than not, for shows that attempt to wrangle the diffuse, confusing galaxy of screens and social media into a coherent narrative. Generation is, hopefully, a step in the right direction for representation and ambition in teen shows. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not an excuse to treat characters with disingenuousness, nor is surface-level progress the recipe for a good watch.

It is the second such court action Epic has taken in Australia following similar court action against Apple, launched in November last year. Fortnite was kicked off both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store in August last year after Epic bypassed the companies\u2019 in-app payment methods in favour of its own cheaper direct billing that prevented Apple and Google taking a share, typically around 30% of the purchase price. The company has since launched legal action in the US, the UK and Australia, and has filed an antitrust complaint against Apple in the EU.   Related: Facebook news ban fears grow as tech giant fails to sign deals with Australia's big media players    In documents filed in the federal court on Wednesday, Epic alleges Google has harmed app developers and consumers in Australia by restricting competition and innovation through preventing choice over app distribution and in-app payments on Android devices. \u201cGoogle\u2019s conduct inflates the price for apps and in-app content for millions of Android device users in Australia,\u201d the filing stated. Unlike Apple\u2019s closed-garden iOS operating system, it is possible to download apps to Android devices outside of the Google Play Store by going to the app developer\u2019s website. This means it is still possible to download Fortnite onto Android devices, but Epic stated in the filing that Google \u201cimposes technical barriers\u201d on direct downloading, including security warnings sent to users who try to do so. Direct downloads of apps do not allow for developers to push out updates, the filing noted. Epic Games accused Google of misusing its market power and engaging in exclusive dealing. Epic founder and CEO Tim Sweeney said in a statement Google had \u201cgiven the illusion\u201d of being open by arguing about the existence of alternative app stores and direct downloads on Android, but these alternative methods of app downloads were rarely used. \u201cThe barriers Google places on Android OS are real. In the case of direct downloading, it makes the process so difficult and scary that it deters users from downloading apps from third party-websites even though it is a totally normal way for users to get apps on a desktop,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe consumers have the right to install apps from sources of their choosing and developers have the right to compete in a fair marketplace.\u201d Google declined to comment. In August, an Apple spokesperson said Epic\u2019s actions in seeking to bypass the in-app purchasing system were expressly about violating App Store guidelines designed to protect customers. \u201cTheir reckless behaviour made pawns of customers, and we look forward to making this clear to Australian courts,\u201d she said. An interlocutory hearing for the Apple case is set down for 23 March and the first Google case management hearing is set for 24 March. Justice Nye Perram, who is overseeing both cases, earlier this month set aside a notice to produce from Epic to Apple seeking a wide variety of information about the Apple app store, including the number of Australian users, apps available, and earnings both in the store and through in-app purchases.

SBS News quoted a Moroccan justice ministry official as saying the arrest took place following an Interpol notice filed by Saudi Arabia, adding that he was wanted by the Saudis for a penal code matter involving theft.

A statement issued on Thursday on behalf of al-Hasani\u2019s family said a Moroccan court had now approved his extradition to Saudi Arabia. \u201cThis is an extraordinary and disappointing decision,\u201d the family\u2019s statement said. The statement, issued by London-based lawyer Haydee Dijkstal, who is acting as the international counsel for al-Hasani, said the extradition was approved \u201cdespite urgent concerns raised of the real and credible risk to Mr al-Hasani\u2019s fundamental rights, safety and security if he is extradited to Saudi Arabia\u201d. Dijkstal said a representative of the Australian government was understood to have been present at the two hearings before the extradition decision was released, but al-Hasani was not present in the courtroom for either hearing. Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has said it is providing consular assistance.

Texas currently ranks 38th in the nation for total administered vaccinations. \n  Announcing the end of the mask mandate, Abbott said last week: \u201cIt is now time to open Texas 100%. So today, I am issuing a new executive order that rescinds most of the earlier executive orders: effective next Wednesday, all businesses of any kind are allowed to open 100%. Also, I am ending the statewide mask mandate.\u201d \n  The announcement fueled condemnation from Democratic leaders across the state.

Biden also emphasized the bill would allow schools to reopen safely, which he has said is a key priority for his administration. \n  Biden will deliver a primetime address tomorrow night, his first primetime speech as president, and he said he will use the opportunity to outline the next stage of the pandemic response. \n  \u201cI\u2019m going to talk about what comes next,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere is light at the end of this dark tunnel of the past year ... There is real reason for hope, folks.\u201d \n  \n Updated at 11.00pm GMT \n \n \n  8.50pm GMT  \n US will purchase another 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Biden confirms \n  \n  Joe Biden confirmed that his administration will purchase another 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s coronavirus vaccine. \n  The president said the additional doses would ensure that the US government has \u201cmaximum flexibility\u201d as it continues to distribute coronavirus vaccines to the American people. \n  \u201cA lot can happen. A lot can change. And we need to be prepared,\u201d Biden said. \n  Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s vaccine has been shown to be less effective than the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, but it has the benefit of being a single-dose vaccine, rather than the double-dose options from Pfizer and Moderna. \n  \n \n \n  8.47pm GMT  \n  \n  Joe Biden commended Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck, who are usually rivals in the corporate health sector, for coming together to produce Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s coronavirus vaccine. \n  The president described the companies\u2019 partnership as the start of \u201ca new chapter in our battle against Covid-19\u201d. \n  Biden added that the companies\u2019 joint efforts are the latest example of American businesses \u201cputting patriotism and public health first\u201d as the country confronts coronavirus. \n  \n \n \n  8.42pm GMT  \n  \n  Joe Biden is now holding a White House event with the CEOs of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck, to provide an update on the companies\u2019 partnership to produce more doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s coronavirus vaccine. \n  Biden is expected to announce that his administration will buy another 100 million doses of Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s vaccine. \n  The president announced earlier this month that the US will have enough vaccine doses for all American adults by the end of May. \n  \n \n \n  8.32pm GMT  \n  \n  Merrick Garland has been confirmed as America\u2019s top law enforcement officer, a boost for Joe Biden\u2019s drive against racial discrimination in the criminal justice system. \n  Garland\u2019s rise to attorney general, approved 70-30 by the US Senate, turns the page on former president Donald Trump\u2019s harsh \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric and efforts to bend the justice department to his will. \n  It also marks a poignant second chance for the 68-year-old judge who, nominated to the supreme court by then president Barack Obama in 2016, was denied a hearing by Senate Republicans on the pretext that it was an election year. \n  This time around his confirmation had been widely expected, especially after a relatively uneventful hearing where Republicans landed few punches. Mitch McConnell, who was Garland\u2019s nemesis in 2016, told reporters last Tuesday that he would back him for attorney general. \n  Garland, however, faces a daunting inbox at a justice department that critics say was left in tatters by Trump and his own attorney general, William Barr. He must attempt to restore morale while addressing demands for racial justice in the wake of last year\u2019s police killing of George Floyd and widespread Black Lives Matter protests. \n   \n    Related: Merrick Garland confirmed as attorney general, turning page on Trump era  \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.17pm GMT  \n 'Help is on the way,' Democratic leaders say as they sign Covid relief bill \n  \n  House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer held a bill enrollment ceremony to celebrate the passage of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill. \n  Pelosi touted the \u201chistoric\u201d legislation, applauding Joe Biden for following through on his campaign promise to deliver financial relief to the American people amid the coronavirus pandemic. \n  \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s vision and his determination were so apparent to the American people and the reason why this legislation enjoys the support of 75% of the American people,\u201d Pelosi said. \n   \n   \n    Senate Majority Leader @SenSchumer celebrates House passage of COVID relief bill:\u201cHelp is on the way.

Today, with final passage in the House of Representatives, their voice has been heard. \n   Now we move forward with the resources needed to vaccinate the nation. To get $1,400 in direct payments to 85% of American households. To expand coverage and help with lowering health care premiums.  \n   To give small businesses what they need to stay open. To expand unemployment insurance, provide food and nutrition assistance. To help keep a roof over people\u2019s heads. To cut child poverty in half. \n   This legislation is about giving the backbone of this nation \u2013 the essential workers, the working people who built this country, the people who keep this country going \u2013 a fighting chance. \n   I want to thank all the members who voted for it, especially Speaker Pelosi, the finest and most capable speaker in the history of our nation. Once again, she has led into law an historic piece of legislation that addresses a major crisis and lifts up millions of Americans. \n   On Friday, I look forward to signing the American Rescue Plan into law at the White House \u2013 a people\u2019s law at the people\u2019s house. \n   \n  \n \n \n  8.04pm GMT  \n  \n  Merrick Garland was approved overwhelmingly by the Senate to become the new attorney general. He was supported by Republicans as well as Democrats. \n  Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell, who as Republican majority leader in 2016 almost single-handedly blocked Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court, voted for the federal appellate judge.  \n   \n    \n    \n    Judge Merrick Garland (C) shakes hands with Vice-President Joe Biden (L) as President Barack Obama waves after Obama announced Garland as his nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court in the Rose Garden of the White House, March 2016. \n    Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters \n    \n   \n  \u201cI\u2019m voting to confirm Judge Garland because of his long reputation as a straight-shooter and legal expert,\u201d McConnell said before the vote. \u201cHis left-of-center perspective has been within the legal mainstream.\u201d \n  Reuters further reports: \n   \n   The bipartisan tally in the Democratic-led Senate was 70-30 to confirm Garland as the top U.S. law enforcement official, with a number of Republicans including McConnell and former Judiciary Committee chairmen Lindsey Graham and Chuck Grassley joining the chamber\u2019s Democrats in support. \n   Garland, 68, will assume the post at a time of heightened concern about domestic extremism. He takes over a Justice Department that Republican former President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to bend to his will. The former federal prosecutor also inherits sensitive ongoing investigations including one involving the new Democratic president\u2019s son. \n   His confirmation represented some measure of vindication for Garland. The Senate in 2016, then controlled by Republicans, refused to consider his nomination to the Supreme Court by Democratic President Barack Obama and declined even to give him a confirmation hearing.  \n   By doing so, the Republicans, led by McConnell, enabled a Republican president, Trump, in 2017 to fill a Supreme Court vacancy with a conservative justice. \n   Garland was nominated by Biden to lead a department in the midst of intensive investigations into the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of Republican former President Donald Trump. \n   Garland has called the attack \u201cheinous\u201d and promised to make the investigation among his top priorities. Hundreds of people have been arrested in connection with the incident including members of right-wing extremist groups. \n   During his confirmation hearing, Garland on Feb. 22 pledged to restore confidence in the department and protect it from political meddling. \n   Trump repeatedly interfered in Justice Department matters, applying pressure to go easy on his friends and allies ensnared in criminal investigations and to target political foes. \n   Garland will also inherit some investigations that began during the Trump administration, including one by Special Counsel John Durham into the FBI\u2019s handling of its investigation into Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and another criminal tax probe into Hunter Biden, the new president\u2019s son. \n   \n  \n Updated at 8.05pm GMT \n \n \n  7.55pm GMT  \n Garland confirmed as attorney general \n  \n  Merrick Garland, who missed out on becoming a supreme court judge in Barack Obama\u2019s administration, has been confirmed by the US Senate to become Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general. \n  \n \n \n  7.19pm GMT  \n  \n  Once Joe Biden signs the relief bill on Friday, the federal government is expected to move quickly to distribute the benefits included in the legislation. \n  White House press secretary Jen Psaki has said she expects most of the $1,400 direct payments to be delivered by the end of this month. \n  The passage of the bill also ensures that supplemental federal unemployment benefits, which are currently set to expire on Sunday, will be extended through early September. \n  \n \n \n  7.11pm GMT  \n House passes $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill, sending it to Biden's desk \n  \n  The House has passed the $1.9trn coronavirus relief bill, delivering Joe Biden his first major legislative victory as president. \n  The final vote was 220 to 211, and it fell almost exactly along party lines. Only one Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, voted against the bill.

Jennifer Agiesta, CNN\u2019s Polling Director, writes: \n   \n   61% support the $1.9 trillion economic relief bill proposed by Biden, and several key provisions of the bill are even more popular. 85% say they support policies in the bill that would provide larger tax credits for families and make them easier for low-income households to claim, including majorities across party lines (95% of Democrats and 73% of Republicans support it). \n   Around three-quarters favor provisions to provide funding to facilitate a return to the classroom for K-12 students (77%), and sending stimulus checks worth up to $1,400 per person to most families and individuals (76%). Both of those policies also have majority support across party lines (55% of Republicans support each, among Democrats, support tops 90% for each one). \n   A smaller majority, 59%, say they back providing $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. That policy sparks the sharpest partisan divide among the four tested, with 88% of Democrats in favor vs. just 28% of Republicans. \n   One measure not in the bill \u2013 raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour to $15 per hour \u2013 also has majority support. Overall, 55% favor such an increase in the minimum wage, including 85% of Democrats, 52% of independents and 20% of Republicans. \n   \n  \n \n \n  1.41pm GMT  \n  \n  Sam Levin in Los Angeles reports for us today on California\u2019s new DA, George Gasc\u00f3n: \n  George Gasc\u00f3n, a former LA police official and district attorney in San Francisco, won his race last November after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor brought mainstream attention to systemic problems in law enforcement. \n  Gasc\u00f3n gained traction as he explicitly spoke about the harms of California\u2019s racist prison system. \u201cWe\u2019ve created this machine of mass incarceration for the last 40 years, that we have normalized what is really abnormal anywhere else in the world,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n recently told the Guardian. \u201cWhat I\u2019m doing is radical for the US \u2026 but sending people to prison for 60 years, 100 years, 150 years, or to death row, or prosecuting a 15-year-old as an adult \u2013 these are all concepts that in most of the rest of the world would be inconceivable.\u201d \n  The stakes are enormous. Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s success or failure could determine whether young people in LA are sentenced to life behind bars, whether elderly people get a chance to come home after decades in prison, and whether the DA\u2019s office pursues criminal cases against police for misconduct and unjust killings. \n  And what happens in LA could affect the future of mass incarceration and reform policies across the US. The LA district attorney\u2019s office is the largest in the country, with jurisdiction over a county larger than most US states, and Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s term has become a crucial test for a growing movement of progressive prosecutors. \n  \u201cThe norm is changing, and the police can\u2019t accept that,\u201d said Helen Jones, an organizer with the group Dignity and Power whose 22 year-old son died in LA sheriff\u2019s custody in 2009. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to have to worry about being held accountable, that one of them might go to jail for murdering somebody\u2019s child.

Before then, at least 200 abortions occurred on Guam every year. Today, accessing the closest legal abortion clinic requires a flight to Hawai\u02bbi, an expensive and difficult undertaking especially during a pandemic. \n  Telemedicine medication abortions, which allow doctors to remotely prescribe the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol to patients up to 10 weeks pregnant, would be an obvious solution, if it were not for a 1978 Guam law that says abortions must be \u201cperformed\u201d in a \u201cmedical clinic or hospital\u201d. The ACLU lawsuit is fighting, in part, to block that law from being enforced. \n  \u201cWe know that many people have reached out to physicians in Hawai\u02bbi about accessing abortions and that not all of them have been able to overcome the enormous financial and logistical obstacles to traveling several thousand miles,\u201d said Vanessa Williams, a Guam lawyer working with the ACLU. \n  Historically, it has not been easy to access abortions on Guam despite them being legal, due to stigma and past restrictive laws. In the 1990s, the mostly Catholic US territory, where 165,000 people live, passed a law that prohibited abortion except when the mother\u2019s life was endangered. Eventually, the US ninth district court of appeals struck down the law, citing Roe v Wade. \n  \u201cThere are very polarizing points of view within our small community on this emotionally charged issue,\u201d said Williams. \n  Read more here: Guam moves closer to restoring abortion access after ACLU lawsuit \n   \n    Related: Guam moves closer to restoring abortion access after ACLU lawsuit   \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.29pm GMT  \n  \n  Alexandra Jaffe at Associated Press has set out a scorecard this morning of what Joe Biden has so far achieved in his early days in office. He had set some ambitious targets for his first 100 days. In the \u201cdone\u201d column Jaffe places these policies: \n   \n   Prioritized addressing the coronavirus pandemic during his first weeks in office. He\u2019s on pace to hit his goal of 100 million vaccine doses administered in his first 100 days. \n   Several early actions fulfilled pledges on climate policy. He signed an executive order on Inauguration Day that revoked the permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline, halted development of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and ordered the review of Trump-era rules on the environment, public health and science. \n   Delivered on top campaign pledges that involved rolling back Trump administration moves. The Biden administration rejoined the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Accord, halted construction of the border wall, ended travel restrictions on people from a variety of Muslim-majority countries and created a task force to reunite families separated at the US-Mexico border. \n   Biden pledged to deliver a comprehensive immigration reform bill to Congress within his first 100 days, and it was unveiled last month. \n   He made early moves to deliver on a pledge to tighten ethical standards in his administration, including a 20 January executive order imposing an ethics pledge on appointees. \n   \n  Jaffe identified these as areas where Biden is yet to meet goals: \n   \n   Yet to take significant action on criminal justice reform, aside from an executive order terminating private prison contracts. Biden pledged to set up a police oversight board within his first 100 days, but there\u2019s been no clear movement in that direction. \n   Other 100-day pledges also awaiting movement: creating a Cabinet-level working group focused on promoting union participation, and ordering an FBI review of issues with gun purchase background checks. \n   Some of Biden\u2019s 100-day pledges will require congressional action, like his promise to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and increase taxes on corporations. Biden also promised to make passage of the Equality Act, which bars discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation and gender identity, a priority in his first 100 days. That bill has passed the House but not the Senate. \n   And some of his promises are waiting on Biden\u2019s Cabinet secretaries to be confirmed by the Senate. On gun control, Biden has said he would direct his attorney general to deliver recommendations to restructure key Justice Department agencies to more effectively enforce the nation\u2019s gun laws. He also pledged to have his secretary of Housing and Urban Development lead a task force to create recommendations for making housing a right for all Americans. \n   \n  \n \n \n  12.22pm GMT  \n Blinken and Austin to make joint trip to Japan and South Korea \n  \n  Secretary of state Antony Blinken and Defense secretary Lloyd J Austin III have just jointly announced that they will be travelling together at the weekend on their first in-person overseas trip \u2013 to Japan and South Korea. \n   \n   \n    I look forward to meeting our friends and allies in Japan and the Republic of Korea in my first in-person visit overseas as Secretary of State. @SecDef will join me in both countries as we work to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and around the world.\u2014 Secretary Antony Blinken (@SecBlinken) \n    March 10, 2021\n    \n   \n  Austin has additionally said that he will then travel on to visit India.

In practice though, vast swaths of Texas have rarely enforced mask or occupancy mandates in the past year, anyway. \n  Several major retailers, grocery and restaurant chains in Texas said they would still require that masks be worn in their stores, which under Abbott\u2019s order relaxing restrictions is their right to do. Some expected to see standoffs between maskless customers and store employees. \n  Texas was one of the first states to reopen its economy after the first wave of pandemic cases last May, and the nation\u2019s second most populous state led the way again last week when Governor Greg Abbott announced the relaxation amid declines in new daily Covid-19 cases and with the rollout of vaccines. \n  County officials in regions where Covid patients take up 15% or more of hospital beds for seven consecutive days can enact new mask and occupancy restrictions, under Abbott\u2019s order, but no regions are currently in that situation. \n  Austin\u2019s city council voted to still require masks - and dared state officials to sue the city. \u201cIn Austin, we\u2019re committed to saving lives,\u201d city council member Greg Casar wrote on Twitter. \n  The Dallas Jewish Conservatives organization plans to host a party Wednesday evening with about 200 people. There will be a moment of silence for the pandemic\u2019s dead, refreshments for the guests and a bonfire into which folks will be encouraged to toss masks. \n  \u201cIt\u2019s about freedom, liberty and personal responsibility,\u201d said Benjie Gershon, founder of the group. \u201cThe act of throwing a mask into the bonfire ... is in no way meant to belittle or undermine the tragic numbers of individuals who have fallen ill to Covid.\u201d \n  Over 45,000 deaths have been recorded in the state from coronavirus. Texas is currently averaging around 500 news cases and 200 further deaths per day. \n  \n \n \n  11.16am GMT  \n Alaska becomes first state to drop eligibility requirements for Covid vaccines \n  \n  Alaska has become the first state to drop eligibility requirements for Covid-19 vaccines, and will now allow anyone 16 or older who lives or works in the state to get a vaccine, Gov Mike Dunleavy said Tuesday. \n  Dunleavy made the announcement after his own bout with COVID-19, which he described as an inconvenience and said underscored his own desire to be vaccinated. He said he did not become severely ill but did not want \u201cto be laid up in the house again,\u201d impact his family or possibly spread the virus to others. \n  Becky Bohrer reports for Associated Press that he described expanding eligibility for vaccines in Alaska as a \u201cgame changer,\u201d particularly with the summer tourist season looming and as the state seeks to rebuild its pandemic-tattered economy. \n  He said he respects those who do not wish to get a vaccine and wanted to relay his personal experience for those mulling vaccination. \u201cI would ask that you give some due consideration,\u201d the Republican said. \n  Dr Anne Zink, the state\u2019s chief medical officer, said officials were seeing open vaccine appointments and wanted to act to allow as many people who want a vaccine to get one. More appointments will be added as vaccine is moved around the state and additional doses come in, she said. \n  \u201cThis does feel like a gigantic milestone in so many ways to get to the point where we can offer protection for anyone who wants it in the state,\u201d Zink said during a news conference with Dunleavy. \n  Alaska has led states in the percentage of its population to have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. At least 25% of the adults in the state have already received at least one dose. The state has reported about 57,300 resident Covid-19 cases and 301 related deaths since the start of the pandemic. \n  \n \n \n  10.53am GMT  \n  \n  Peter Stone reports for us on how US far-right extremists are making millions via social media and cryptocurrency: \n  Dozens of extremist groups and individuals, including some involved in the Capitol attack, have used social media platforms, cryptocurrencies, tax-exempt status and other fundraising tools to rake in about $1.5m in the last year, according to experts. \n  Two recent studies by groups that track extremist financing, the Global Disinformation Index (GDI) and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), underscore the growing threat posed by far-right extremists, including those who attacked Congress to stop the certification of the 2020 election results. \n  The recent studies and testimony delivered to a House committee by representatives from the SPLC and GDI in late February showed that the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and others with white supremacist and anti-immigrant bias, reaped windfalls via the streaming platform DLive, cryptocurrencies and other fundraising methods. \n  Megan Squire, a computer science professor at Elon University and a senior fellow at the SPLC, found that from 15 April to early February, 55 extremist individuals and groups used the video streaming platform DLive, which allows cryptocurrency-based donations for content, to pull in just under $866,700. \n  \u201cThe idea that multiple hate groups could raise tens of thousands of dollars a month from bleeding-edge technology and a tiny donor pool should be terrifying, not ho-hum,\u201d Squire said in an interview. \u201cThis is the canary in the coalmine, and we ignore it at our peril.\u201d \n  In a statement, DLive noted its guidelines prohibit hate speech and inciting violence, and that after the Capitol attack it \u201cindefinitely suspended the accounts of the individuals who used DLive to livestream from the riots,\u201d and their access to any \u201ctokens given to them by community members\u201d. \n  According to GDI co-founder Daniel Rogers, 44% of the 73 hate groups he has studied have benefited by securing tax exempt status from the Internal Revenue Service. \n  Read more of Peter Stone\u2019s report here: US far-right extremists making millions via social media and cryptocurrency \n   \n    Related: US far-right extremists making millions via social media and cryptocurrency  \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.32am GMT  \n  \n  The exchanges between potential jurors, attorneys and the judge at the outset of Derek Chauvin\u2019s murder trial illustrated yesterday the challenges in seating a jury in such a well-known case.

Opening statements are scheduled no sooner than 29 March. \n  Amy Forliti, for the Associated Press, writes that the three jurors who were selected yesterday \u2013 two men and one woman \u2013 all said they had heard some details about the case against Chauvin but would be able to put aside what they heard or opinions they had formed and make a decision based on evidence in court.  \n  One of the selected jurors said he hadn\u2019t seen the bystander video of George Floyd\u2019s arrest at all, while the others described seeing it minimally. A person who worried about the divisiveness of the case was dismissed, as was a potential juror who feared his family could be targeted. \n  The first man who was selected to serve on the jury, a chemist who says he works to find facts and thinks analytically, said he has never watched the video of Floyd\u2019s arrest but that he has seen a still image from it. When asked if he could decide the case based on the evidence, he said, \u201cI\u2019d rely on what I hear in court.\u201d \n  The man, whom prosecutors said identifies as white, said he supports the Black Lives Matter movement, but views the organization itself unfavorably. He also has an unfavorable view of the Blue Lives Matter movement. He said everyone should matter the same. \n  \u201cThe whole point of that is that all lives should matter equally, and that should include police,\u201d he said. \n  Another juror, a woman who is related to a police officer in greater Minnesota, said she initially had a negative perception of Chauvin because of what she saw in the bystander video, but said she doesn\u2019t know him and could be proven wrong. \u201cThat video just makes you sad,\u201d said the woman. \u201cNobody wants to see somebody die, whether it was his fault or not.\u201d \n  The third juror selected, an auditor, also told the court he would be open-minded. \n  Outside the proceedings this week members of Floyd\u2019s family have spoken. Bridgett Floyd, his sister, said that her family was glad the trial had finally arrived and was \u2018praying for justice\u2019. \n   \n    \n    \n     \n    \n    \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.22am GMT  \n  \n  Also coming down the track from the House of Representatives this week has been the PRO Act, which was passed yesterday. It will almost certainly face a filibuster attempt from Republicans in the Senate, which hasn\u2019t stopped Sen Bernie Sanders urging all of his colleagues to get behind it. David Brenna writes for Newsweek: \n   \n   The act would strengthen the rights of American workers to strike for better wages and working conditions, introduce new protections for union elections, and give the National Labor Relations Board the power to fine employers who violate workers\u2019 rights, among other reforms. \n   Sanders appealed to colleagues on Twitter to take up the bill on Tuesday. \u201cThe trade union movement is the last line of defense against a billionaire class that won\u2019t be satisfied until they have it all,\u201d Sanders said. \n   But the legislation is highly unlikely to win the 60 Senate votes needed to avoid a Republican filibuster. Five House Republicans voted for the legislation, but the vast majority of GOP members stood against the bill, despite recent claims from prominent party members that the GOP has become the true party of the working class. \n   \n  Exchanges in the House were quite testy. In response to Republican objections that the regulations might limit the freedoms of small buisness oweners, Ohio\u2019s Tim Ryan said \u201cHeaven forbid we pass something that\u2019s going to help the damn workers in the United States of America.\u201d \n  \n \n \n  10.10am GMT  \n  \n  Rep Pramila Jayapal has added to her words overnight with a tweet emphasising that it was only the election results \u2013 particularly those in Georgia which allowed the Democrats to take control of the Senate in January \u2013 which have made passing this coronavirus relief bill possible. \n   \n   \n    Tomorrow the House will vote to send a robust relief package to the president\u2019s desk.Tonight I\u2019m thinking of all the organizers who made this moment possible \u2014 winning the White House, flipping the Senate, keeping the House, and delivering a powerful mandate for change.\u2014 Rep.

Once passed by the House, the bill will be sent to Biden for signature. \n  The Senate passed the bill on Saturday in a 50-49 vote, Democrats overcoming unified Republican opposition and a last-minute objection by Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a member of their own party. \n  The package before the House on Wednesday was narrower than Biden\u2019s initial proposal, which included progressive priorities subsequently either stripped out or scaled back to appease moderates like Manchin, who echoed Republicans with concerns that the infusion of aid was too big in an economy showing signs of revival. \n  A provision to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour was deemed inadmissible under a budget process Democrats used to bypass Republican opposition. \n  The Senate-approved version tightens eligibility for stimulus checks and restructures a proposal for unemployment benefits that Biden hoped to raise to $400 a week. Under the new plan, unemployment benefits will remain at $300 a week but will be extended through the beginning of September, rather than August. The first $10,200 of supplements from 2020 will be made tax-free. \n  Though disappointed with some of the amendments, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, called them \u201crelatively minor concessions\u201d and said the overall package remained \u201ctruly progressive and bold\u201d. \n  Read more of Lauren Gambino\u2019s report here: US House poised to approve Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9tn Covid relief plan \n   \n    Related: US House poised to approve Joe Biden's $1.9tn Covid relief plan  \n   \n  \n \n \n  10.05am GMT  \n  \n  Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of US politics on a day when Congress is expected to give a final approval to the Democrats $1.9 trillion coronavirus economic relief bill. Here\u2019s where we are and what we expect to see later today\u2026 \n   \n   The House will convene at 9am today (1400 GMT), to hold its final vote on the $1.9tn coronavirus relief bill. Democrats are expected to quickly pass the bill in a party-line vote. Joe Biden has already said he will sign the legislation as soon as it reaches his desk. \n   The first three jurors were seated and several rejected in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged in the killing of George Floyd which began yesterday after a 24-hour delay. \n   Arkansas has passed a new law banning nearly all abortions in the state. Supporters hope challenges to the sweeping measure will force the US supreme court to revisit Roe v Wade. \n   A sixth woman has come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo. \n   The FBI released a video of the suspect who planted pipe bombs in Washington on 5 January, the day before the Capitol insurrection. The bureau is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person. \n   Biden will be hosting an event this afternoon at the White House with the CEOs of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck, who have collaborated on the manufacture of a Covid vaccine to ramp up supplies in the US. \n   There will be a coronavirus press briefing at 11am, and Jen Psaki will give her press briefing at 12.30pm.

Photograph: Brandon Bell/AFP/Getty Images    Fudge, who has represented parts of Cleveland and Akron in the House since 2008, is a former mayor and a longtime advocate for assistance for the needy. She said at her confirmation hearing in January that her first priority would be protecting the millions of people who have fallen behind on rent or mortgages due to loss of income during the pandemic, telling senators that \u201cwe cannot afford to allow people in the midst of a pandemic to be put in the streets\u201d. Shortly after she was confirmed, Fudge took the last vote of her House career in support of the $1.9tn Covid-19 relief bill, which will provide billions in housing assistance to low-income households.  The Senate also confirmed federal judge Merrick Garland as attorney general on Wednesday. All three nominees won bipartisan support for their nominations.

The Senate banking, housing and urban affairs committee chairman, Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat who lives in Fudge\u2019s district, noted that Ohio suffered a disproportionate number of foreclosures even before the 2008 economic crisis. \u201cShe knows how for decades, communities have watched as factories closed, investment dried up and storefronts were boarded over,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd she knows how many neighborhoods and towns have never had the investment they should \u2013 because of discrimination, because of redlining, because of decades of policy that funneled resources and jobs away from Black and brown communities.\u201d The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said Fudge \u201chas a difficult job ahead of her\u201d as millions of American renters are behind on payments and millions of homeowners are in forbearance. The Covid-19 relief bill provides about $30bn to help low-income households and the unemployed afford rent and utilities, and to assist the homeless with vouchers and other support. States and tribes would receive an additional $10bn for homeowners struggling with mortgage payments because of the pandemic. Regan is known in his home state for pursuing cleanups of industrial toxins and helping low-income and minority communities significantly affected by pollution. Senator Tom Carper, who is the chairman of the environment panel, said Regan had a proven record of forging \u201cpractical solutions to clean our air and our water, while building a more nurturing environment for job creation and job preservation\u201d. One of Regan\u2019s biggest challenges will be returning scientific integrity to an agency that, under former president Donald Trump, frequently allowed business groups and other special interests to \u201cplay a large role in crafting the agency\u2019s policies\u201d, Carper said. The confirmations were not without criticism from Republicans. The West Virginia senator Shelley Moore Capito, the top Republican on the environment panel, said Regan would return the EPA to the policy agenda of the Obama administration, an agenda she said \u201cabsolutely devastated my state and other energy-producing states\u201d. Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey criticized some of Fudge\u2019s past comments about Republicans, saying they could have a \u201ctoxic and detrimental impact on the working relationship that ought to be a constructive relationship\u201d between Congress and the Biden administration. Toomey referenced a statement Fudge made last year when GOP senators moved to fill the supreme court vacancy left by the death of justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg after blocking Obama\u2019s nominee \u2013 Garland, the newly confirmed attorney general \u2013 four years earlier. Fudge at the time called Senate Republicans \u201ca disgrace to this nation\u201d and said they \u201chave no decency, they have no honor, they have no integrity\u201d.

But the coroner still found that Anaiwan-Dunghutti man Nathan Reynolds died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d that were partly exacerbated by deficiencies in the management of his severe asthma. \u201cNathan\u2019s medical crisis on the night of 31 August required an emergency response. But the response he received fell well short of this. It was confused, uncoordinated and unreasonably delayed,\u201d the deputy state coroner, Elizabeth Ryan, said.   Related: NSW had two Indigenous deaths in custody last week, parliament told    \u201cThe delay deprived Nathan of at least some chance of surviving his acute asthma attack. These failures were due both to numerous system deficiencies and to individual errors of judgement.\u201d During the inquest in October last year, the coroner was told that prison officers took about 10 minutes to respond to calls for help. Officer Matthew Fawzy told the court he had been waiting for a colleague to see Reynolds. When asked why this took roughly 10 minutes, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything.\u201d When asked why he didn\u2019t run to Reynolds, the prison officer said he had been trained to avoid that. \u201cWe were taught never to run unless it\u2019s an officer actually getting assaulted,\u201d Fawzy said. Taking Reynolds\u2019 call at 11.27pm for help as the starting point, the coroner said it took more than eleven minutes for correctional officers to reach his side, 13 minutes for a nurse to be summoned, 22 minutes before a nurse arrived at his side and 47 minutes before ambulance paramedics attended him. \u201cThese time frames cannot be accepted as adequate or appropriate,\u201d she said. During the inquest, fellow inmate Jeremy Preo, who was trained in first aid, cried as he told the coroner he placed Reynolds in the recovery position and did his best to open the man\u2019s airways. \u201cHe\u2019s done like a big gurgle and that\u2019s when I started rubbing my arm on his back and said, \u2018Mate, keep breathing\u2019,\u201d Preo told the NSW coroners court while wiping his eyes. \u201cHe was alive then. He could hear me.\u201d But Preo said he was distressed when the nurse arrived and rolled Reynolds onto his back. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her ... slap Nathan in the face and aggressively shake him, and telling him to wake up,\u201d Preo told the court. \u201cThe nurse then said to [prison officer John Fifita] that Nathan\u2019s had a drug overdose.\u201d The nurse said she asked other inmates what Reynolds had taken when she arrived on the scene about 11.50pm and saw his pupils were fixed. Wright told the court she gave him naloxone, which reverses the effects of a drug overdose.She said she did not recall anyone telling her about his asthma and denied slapping or shaking him. In delivering her findings, Ryan said the failures in Nathan\u2019s care went beyond what happened that night. The care he received after entering custody four months before he died was \u201cinadequate\u201d. \u201cIt failed to reduce his risk for a fatal asthma attack. It did not comply with established treatment for the management of severe asthma. It did not even comply with NSW Health\u2019s own policies to prevent chronically ill prisoners from deterioration and death. These failings significantly increased Nathan\u2019s risk for the fatal attack which took his life on the night of 31 August,\u201d Ryan said. However, she said her recommendations resulting from his inadequate care were \u201cnot focused on attributing blame\u201d, and were \u201cmade in the hope that people like Nathan who enter custody with conditions of severe asthma will have a better chance of avoiding a life threatening attack, and of surviving one should it happen\u201d.   Related: 'Why does it take so long?' The desperate wait for answers after a death in custody    Reynolds did not receive an assessment of his asthma or a management plan at the jail, despite the intake nurse noting his history of asthma, including that he had a nebuliser at home, when he was first admitted to the prison in May 2018. The nurse recommended that Reynolds\u2019 asthma be assessed. A month later \u2013 even after he was hospitalised having suffered a severe asthma attack \u2013 the assessment still did not occur. The court heard that the intake nurse\u2019s note recommending an assessment was at some point replaced with one saying Reynolds refused to go to the emergency department. Reynolds\u2019 family demanded accountability from Justice Health and NSW Corrective Services for the failings in his care. \u201cIt\u2019s soul-crushing knowing that at just 36 years old, Nathan died on the cold floor of a prison, separated from his family and loved ones. Words can\u2019t describe our pain. \u201cWe are also angry because Nathan\u2019s death was preventable. He would not have died if he weren\u2019t in prison. This can\u2019t just be treated as an accident \u2013 it must be recognised as a huge institutional failing and people must be held responsible.\u201d Karly Warner, CEO of the Aboriginal Legal Service NSW/ACT, said processes in prisons to manage chronic health conditions \u201cwere hardly worth the paper they\u2019re written on, as staff were either unaware of them or failed to follow them\u201d. \u201cIn the four months he was in prison, Nathan\u2019s health steadily deteriorated and there were clear signs that he was heading for an acute asthma attack. He was cut off from community healthcare and entirely in the hands of Corrective Services NSW and Justice Health, who failed in their responsibilities to him,\u201d she said. \u201cThat failure cost Nathan his life.

Photograph: Kazuma Obara/The Guardian    When the order came for the residents of Iitate village to leave, Muneo Kanno\u2019s thoughts immediately turned to his cattle and crops. The triple meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant had already forced the evacuation of tens of thousands of people living within 20km of the wrecked facility. But most of Iitate\u2019s 6,000 residents stayed put, convinced they were safe since their homes were well outside the official evacuation zone.   map   The local authorities did not order an evacuation until several weeks later, after a radiation expert discovered multiple hotspots in the village 48km from the power plant. Kanno made regular visits home from the evacuation place to test his rice crops, but his wife would not return until the evacuation was officially lifted in 2017 following an unprecedented decontamination operation in Fukushima prefecture. Long before then, the region\u2019s healthy cattle had been sent to other parts of Japan, while those found to contain unsafe levels of radiation were destroyed.

I couldn\u2019t even begin to think about the business. I was exhausted.

The ocean took almost everything from the Abes, but today it is once again the family\u2019s friend.

Environmental groups congratulated the Queensland government after it passed legislation on Wednesday night that will ban single-use plastic items, including polystyrene food containers and cups, from 1 September. The state\u2019s environment minister, Meaghan Scanlon, said the state had seen benefits from its 2018 ban on single-use plastic bags, which had dropped 70% in litter surveys. The state\u2019s container deposit scheme that gives a 10c return on most plastic and glass bottles, also introduced in 2018, was now approaching 3bn returned items.

Last week the federal government launched a national plastics plan that includes a phase-out by 2022 of expanded polystyrene packaging and food containers. Queensland\u2019s ban covers single-use plastic straws, stirrers, cutlery and plates, and polystyrene food containers and cups. The laws exempt supply to people who need any of those items, such as people with disability or healthcare needs. Exemptions have also been made for plastic straws and spoons attached to food packaging, including drink cartons and yoghurts, though the minister said this would be reviewed. More items could be added under the legislation, Scanlon said, and consultation was continuing. Toby Hutcheon, of the Boomerang Alliance of more than 50 environmental groups, said he hoped to see coffee cups and lids and other plastic takeaway items, and heavyweight plastic bags joining the banned list. Hutcheon thanked the Liberal National party, the Queensland Greens and Katter\u2019s Australian party for backing the law. The plastics included in the ban were among the most littered items in Queensland, he said, with the latest Clean Up Australia report from litter-pick days estimating 30% of all items collected were plastic packaging. He said the Australian Capital Territory, Victoria and Western Australia have also announced single-use plastic bans but have yet to put those into law. The best approach for the public, he said, was to avoid the use of single-use plastic items entirely, or to buy reusable or compostable versions. Shane Cucow, of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the laws were \u201cfantastic news for Queensland\u2019s turtles, whales and seabirds\u201d. He added: \u201cEvery day we wait we lose more animal lives.

Related: Biden poised for first major legislative victory with House vote on $1.9tn Covid relief \u2013 live    The massive legislation, a broadly popular bill with the public, received no Republican support. It aims to fulfill Democrats\u2019 campaign promise to combat the coronavirus and revive a pummeled economy. It also includes sweeping anti-poverty measures that attempt to tackle deep-seated racial and gender inequalities in the American economy. Here are the main elements of the bill: $1,400 stimulus checks: A majority of Americans \u2013 as many as 85% of US households, according to Democrats \u2013 will receive direct payments of $1,400 per person. Individuals making less than $75,000 and married couples making less than $150,000 collectively would receive the checks. The payments would gradually decrease for those earning more than those income levels, with the benefit capped at $80,000 for individuals and $160,000 for married couples, who won\u2019t receive checks. The threshold is lower than Biden had initially proposed, and was changed to accommodate objections from moderate Democrats in the Senate. Unemployment benefits: The bill extends through early September the $300-a-week federal unemployment benefits approved in a previous aid package. Biden proposed expanding the supplement to $400 a week through August, but the Senate kept it at $300, while extending the benefit through September. It also included a provision to make the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits received in 2020 tax-free for households earning less than $150,000. Child tax credit: The legislation significantly increases \u2013 and expands eligibility for \u2013 the child tax credit, a longtime progressive priority that Democrats are hoping to make permanent after the pandemic. Under the bill, the tax credit would jump from $2,000 a child under 17 to $3,600 for children up to age five and $3,000 for children aged between six and 17. Taken together with other benefits, it is estimated the expansion will halve the number of children living in poverty in America. Health insurance subsidies: The bill would temporarily increase financial assistance for health coverage purchased through marketplaces established by the Obama administration\u2019s Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. It also aims to help those who are unemployed keep their health coverage, as well as provides additional funding for military veterans\u2019 healthcare and other health programs. Vaccine distribution and testing: The bill provides tens of billions of dollars to speed up vaccine distribution and administration, as well as increase coronavirus testing and enhance contact tracing and genomic sequencing. Pandemic response: The bill sends $350bn to state, local and tribal governments, to help offset deep budget shortfalls as a result of efforts to combat the pandemic. It also includes $130bn to help schools reopen safely by reducing class sizes and modifying classrooms to improve ventilation and social distancing. Colleges and universities would receive $40bn to help cover the cost of pandemic-related expenses. Businesses would also get funding, including under a new program to help bars and restaurants hurt by Covid lockdowns. Rental, mortgage and food assistance: The legislation also includes a number of other provisions that would provide assistance for food and housing, including money for low-income Americans to afford rent and pay their utilities, and aid to homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages because of the pandemic.", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "'Not the NDIS we fought for': disability advocates fear new assessments driven by cost cutting", "full_article": "Top disability advocates say a government plan to introduce \u201cindependent assessments\u201d to the NDIS is aimed at cutting costs and will \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d the landmark scheme.

Under the current process, applicants submit evidence from experts, including their specialists, but the government argues this has led to inconsistent funding outcomes and that obtaining the reports can be costly for people with disability.   Related: 'Uphill battle': for disability advocates, there's something missing in Hobart's Parliament Square    But in a statement issued on Thursday, the advocacy groups argue the changes \u201cwould fundamentally alter the individualised and personalised nature of the NDIS\u201d. \u201cWhile we all want greater consistency, we are very concerned this increasingly automated process will not adequately consider individual need and circumstance,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is not the NDIS we fought for.\u201d The groups, which included People With Disability Australia, Australian Federation of Disability Organisations and Every Australian Counts, will brief MPs about their concerns at a video conference on Thursday. Notably, the advocacy groups also said that based on the information that been released by the agency, they were \u201cconcerned that a desire to cut costs is the main motivation for the hurried introduction of these reforms\u201d. They also argued the providers who would carry out the assessments would be contracted by the government, creating a conflict of interest. \u201cThe introduction of mandatory assessments is the biggest change to the NDIS since it began. Despite the scale and cost of the changes, they have not been rigorously tested or undergone an independent evaluation,\u201d they said. \u201cConsultation has been rushed and the questions and concerns of people with disability, their families and the organisations that support and represent them have not been addressed.\u201d The NDIA is currently undertaking a consultation process on the reforms, while a parliamentary committee is also set to examine the changes. However, the government has said it plans to legislate to allow independent assessments to begin in mid-2021. Mel Tran, social entrepreneur and NDIS participant, said the scheme had a \u201clong way to go\u201d but that independent assessments were \u201cnot the answer\u201d.

Dougie Herd, who helped campaign for the NDIS, said the mandatory assessments would \u201cput people living with disability back in boxes based on an automated process\u201d. \u201cThe NDIS was an idea that became a reality because of bipartisan leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople with disability are looking for that leadership again.\u201d The disability services sector has also rounded on the assessments, with David Moody, the chief executive of National Disability Services, also calling for the reforms to be halted.

But Don Elgin, an ex-Paralympian who now works at Wallara Disability Support Services, said it would be difficult for some to articulate their needs \u201cto a stranger in a three hour window\u201d. \u201cAt worst it forces people to play the game of being disabled,\u201d he said. Aaron Carpenter, who took part in the assessments pilot, told the Guardian last week he was asked many \u201cyes or no\u201d questions with little context and was assessed by a physiotherapist despite having autism. Last week, a coalition of 25 other disability organisations, including legal centres that help people navigate the system, also called for the assessments to be scrapped. The NDIS minister, Stuart Robert, has previously argued the reforms were based on the Productivity Commission\u2019s original design for the scheme and were recommendations from the 2019 Tune review into the NDIS Act. He has argued the changes will make the system fairer and more consistent, and stressed that the government is consulting with the disability community about the changes.

The fund from royalties from Peter Jackson\u2019s Academy Award-winning film They Shall Not Grow Old, which was commissioned by IWM, would ensure funding for more than 20 ambitious commissions bringing art to audiences across the UK, the museums said. Awards will range from \u00a320,000 to \u00a3250,000. The scheme reflected one first set up by the wartime government in 1916, which saw war art on an unprecedented scale, with artists dispatched to the western front \u201ccreating a record for society\u201d, said IWM\u2019s head of art, Rebecca Newell. Thursday\u2019s announcement was \u201ca continuation of the engagement we have been supporting over the last 100 years\u201d, with commissions covering artistic practice in the broadest sense possible, she added. The first world war government scheme saw a marked shift from the Napoleonic-style, Waterloo-type paintings that had previously dominated, when war art mainly commemorated British triumphs. \u201cFor the first time, artists were involved as soldiers, and older established artists sent out with the brief to record their experience, people\u2019s experiences, to record what they saw, whether that was visceral or symbolic,\u201d said Newell. Back then, the government decreed half of all works would go to national institutions, the bulk to IWM where they are exhibited still today, and some to the Tate. The rest would be dispersed to museums and galleries across the nation, making it art for the people. Muirhead Bone, an established Scottish artist known for his etched landscapes, was one of the first commissioned. William Orpen and John Lavery, both Irish and from the \u201cglitterati of artists at that time\u201d, were notable and influential in the field. Henry Tonks, a surgeon and watercolourist, most famous for his facial disfigurement works, was another. Stanley Spencer, Christopher Nevinson and brothers Paul and John Nash were all dispatched to the frontline.     Detail from A Tank (1917) by the war artist Christopher Nevinson. Photograph: CRW Nevinson/Imperial War Museum \u00a9 Artists Estate    The emerging voice of modernism was evident in conflict art, especially from the Slade, in abstractionism and cubism. \u201cSo, alongside these established painters, there was this new language being championed, which we recognise as modernism now, but at the time was revolutionary-type art \u2013 all being collected for the nation. It was everyone\u2019s collection,\u201d said Newell. The IWM created its own first world war sub-scheme, in tandem with the government\u2019s official scheme. This concentrated on the \u201chome front\u201d with a focus on women\u2019s work, commissioning female artists and depicting scenes from areas such as nursing, ambulance driving, industry and laundry. Fast forward through the second world war, the cold war, the Falklands conflict, where Linda Kitson was an official artist, through to Iraq and Afghanistan, \u201cand there is a direct line all the way through\u201d, said Newell. Today the role of the war artist is completely different. \u201cAs a society, we understand conflict in a completely different way. For example, in WWI and WW2 there was clearly defined geography,\u201d she said. When the censors ordered no depictions of dead enemy \u201cthere was a clearer understanding of enemy versus friend\u201d, she added. Artists today had to try to understand the \u201cdisembodied nature of warfare\u201d which blurred the lines, she said, such as the absence warfare created, and the \u201chidden enemy\u201d such as improvised explosive devices. The challenge for new artists was how to capture some of those aspects of contemporary warfare \u2013 the seen and the unseen \u2013 which was the debate the IWM hoped its new commissioning would address. The commissions can include performative works, such as theatre or ballet, or film-making. For Iraq, the IWM commissioned the film-maker Steve McQueen, whose work Queen and Country, on the theme of repatriation, took sculptural form, with a wooden structure containing postage stamp-sized images of deceased and injured soldiers. In 2017, it commissioned the film Electrical Gaza by Rosalind Nashashibi. IWM will work in partnerships with cultural organisations to co-commission the new works as a continuation of its 14-18 NOW project set up to mark the centenary of the first world war. Diane Lees, IWM\u2019s director general, said more than 300 million watched Jackson\u2019s film. But much had changed since 2018, with museums and galleries closed due to the Covid pandemic. \u201cFinancially, we know first-hand how challenging it\u2019s been for cultural organisations throughout this period, which makes us all the more delighted that this money was set aside in such a way that we\u2019ve been able to support others.\u201d Jenny Waldman, former director of 14-18 NOW, and now director of Art Fund, said of the Jackson film: \u201cThis fund is a tribute to his generosity and the enormous success of his film.\u201d", "author": "Ewan Murray"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Griff, Pa Salieu and Rina Sawayama nominated for Brits Rising Star ", "full_article": "The nominees for the Brits Rising Star award, aimed at tipping the future of British pop, have been announced.

A quarter said Covid had made no difference to inequality and 16% were unsure. The commission said the survey echoed growing evidence that the most socially disadvantaged had been hardest hit by the pandemic against a range of measures, from jobs and living standards, to health and access to online schooling.

Exactly a third of people in the north of England felt their living standards had taken the biggest battering, compared with just 10% of those in the south. Just 12% of south of England respondents felt their region had borne the heaviest brunt on health of the pandemic. This compared, at the other end of the scale, with 32% in London, 31% in the north, and 31% in Northern Ireland. Scottish respondents were among those least likely to say they had been worst affected across all indicators. Nearly half (44%) of the sample said they felt better off financially than a decade ago, although this was far more prevalent among the most affluent social classes (50%) than the least well-off (26%). Over a third of the poorest respondents (37%) felt worse off, a significantly higher proportion than any other social class. The proportions of people saying they felt better or worse off financially than they did 10 years previously had remained largely static over the past four years \u2013 until this year, when there were significant increases in both groups. The commission said it was not possible to say from the survey whether this dramatic recent change in people\u2019s perceptions of their financial health was related to the coronavirus outbreak, though it said it could be connected to the varying fortunes of those who were able to stay in work and save money, and those who lost their jobs. Asked to rate the two most negative impacts of coronavirus on people in their region, 55% singled out people\u2019s mental health, 44% pinpointed lack of social contact, 26% said job opportunities, 22% chose access to education, and 18% people\u2019s physical health. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThis government is committed to levelling up outcomes for every individual, across the country. Supporting people\u2019s mental wellbeing is a priority, which is why we are providing an additional \u00a3500m for mental health services and \u00a379m to expand mental health support teams in schools and colleges.  \u201cOn top of that, our multi-billion pound plan for jobs aims to protect, support and create jobs across the country and offers targeted support to help jobseekers of all ages back into work.  \u201cWe are also providing \u00a31.7bn to help children and young people with education recovery after time out of the classroom.\u201d", "author": "Amudalat Ajasa in Minneapolis and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "Bowel cancer screening capsules the latest in at-home care trend", "full_article": "People will be able to check if they have bowel cancer by swallowing a tiny capsule containing miniature cameras, in an extension of patient self-care. \nIn what experts described as a trend towards more NHS at-home care, hastened by the Covid-19 pandemic, thousands of people in England will be able to avoid the discomfort of having a camera inserted into their bowel by instead swallowing a capsule the size of a cod liver oil tablet. \nPictures transmitted from inside their body during the painless procedure will help doctors judge whether the person has bowel cancer, the second deadliest form of the disease in the UK. \nThe boss of the NHS in England said the procedure, known as a colon capsule endoscopy, is an example of \u201csci-fi\u201d medicine increasingly deployed to improve care. One of the country\u2019s top doctors said the capsules illustrated a major shift of healthcare out of hospitals that will see more and more diagnosis and treatment of illness done at home. \n\u201cAs we come out of \u2018peak Covid\u2019 and the disruption of the pandemic, the NHS is now pushing ahead with genuine innovation to expand services for many other conditions. That\u2019s why we\u2019re now trialling these ingenious capsule cameras to allow more people to undergo cancer investigations quickly and safely,\u201d said Sir Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England. \n\u201cWhat sounds like sci-fi is now becoming a reality, and as these minute cameras pass through your body, they take two pictures per second, checking for signs of cancer and other conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease.\u201d \nNHS England\u2019s trial of the capsules, which are 2cm long, follows its decision last month to send 31,000 women in London a home kit to test for signs of cervical cancer and overcome the awkwardness and discomfort some women feel at having a smear test for the human papilloma virus with a nurse or doctor. \nAround 11,000 patients with potential symptoms of bowel cancer will be offered the option of swallowing a capsule as an alternative to having a standard endoscopy. The latter involves an invasive process in which a tiny camera mounted on a thin flexible wire is guided into someone\u2019s body and then around their large bowel, where it takes pictures. \nIn contrast, colon capsule endoscopy involves the patient visiting a nurse who fits a belt and receiver around their waist under their clothing to capture the pictures, before taking the capsule, going home and using laxatives to clean out their bowel so that the cameras can get clear images. \n \n  \n  \n  The \u2018PillCam\u2019, shown for size reference next to a pen \n  Photograph: NHS England/PA \n  \n \nThe process takes five to eight hours. Photographs of the bowel are sent wirelessly from the capsule and later passed on to a cancer specialist to help them decide whether or not the person has bowel cancer, which kills about 16,600 people a year. Patients excrete the capsule when they go to the toilet. \nThe test is already being used across Scotland. The NHS there has found that most patients tested this way turn out to be cancer-free and do not experience any risks or complications with what they call the ScotCap Test, though the laxatives can leave some feeling sick and dehydrated. \nProf Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians, said: \u201cThe future of healthcare should be closer to the home, and indeed that is the vision of the NHS Long Term Plan [for the NHS in England]. As technologies develop, we will see more and more tests that can be done at home, which is great, provided they are accessible by all. \n\u201cRegarding colon capsules, we hope this will save some people from having to have a colonoscopy. But they will still need to have bowel preparation, which many say is the worst part of a colonoscopy, and come to hospitals or clinics to be given the capsule and monitoring equipment.\u201d \nProf Peter Johnson, NHS England\u2019s clinical director for cancer, said the latest initiative in at-home care showed the service was fast-tracking new ways of treating and diagnosing cancer. It responded to the suspension of much hospital-based cancer care during the pandemic by delivering chemotherapy drugs to thousands of patients who were unable to have radiotherapy. \u201cThis is just one further example of the NHS embracing the latest innovative treatment options and bringing the NHS home to patients.\u201d \nProf Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: \u201cWe\u2019re aware that some patients are reluctant to seek help for certain cancers because the diagnostic tests available can be invasive, so this is a fascinating development and we will be very interested to see the results of the trial. \n\u201cGPs are preparing for an upsurge in cases of suspected cancer cases post-Covid, and the capsule cameras and new test for cervical cancer are welcome developments that could enable more patients to monitor and manage their own health at home without embarrassment or discomfort.\u201d \nThe endoscopy team at University College London Hospitals NHS trust is already using the capsules to detect bowel cancer.", "author": "Daniel Strauss, Oliver Milman and agencies"}, {"date": "2021-03-11", "title": "M&S to sell rival lingerie brands for the first time", "full_article": "Marks &amp; Spencer is to sell rival lingerie brands for the first time as part of a new initiative to boost sales on its website. The retailer, which already accounts for just under a third of UK underwear sales, is to introduce selected items from Sloggi and Triumph \u2013 the brand behind the world\u2019s bestselling Doreen bra \u2013 alongside eight other new clothing labels debuting on its website over the next few months. Additional womenswear brands will include Hobbs, Joules, Phase Eight, Seasalt and White Stuff, as well as less well-known names including YAS and Sosandar. Menswear brand Jack &amp; Jones will also be added to the roster. James Clark of the London College of Fashion said that introducing additional lingerie brands could give M&amp;S access to a wider range of sizes without having to hold them all in stock. The alternative brands may also help M&amp;S attract new shoppers. \u201cLingerie is a very intimate part of apparel and has very high brand loyalty, as once you adopt a brand, you know the fit and shape is right, particularly in bras,\u201d Clark said. Marks &amp; Spencer, which has relied on the pulling power of its own label for decades, took its first step into selling outside brands in October last year with the launch of independent eco-fashion label Nobody\u2019s Child on its website. Items from Ben Sherman, Russell Athletic, Original Penguin and Elle Junior as well as exclusive product from Finery and Ghost are also now on the group\u2019s website. The company also recently bought the Jaeger brand out of administration. M&amp;S said the additional brands would attract new shoppers to its website and help it to expand. Nearly 10% of those who have bought Nobody\u2019s Child had not bought womenswear from its site before. Neil Harrison, director of brands at M&amp;S, said the new strategy was designed to \u201cturbocharge online growth\u201d by offering its 22m customers something new. \u201cWe need to give customers more choice and reasons to shop at M&amp;S,\u201d he said. M&amp;S\u2019s shift in strategy reflects similar moves at rival Next, which has signed a string of new brand partnerships in the past 18 months after gradually expanding the range of labels it sells via its website and catalogues. Both M&amp;S and Next considered buying Topshop and both looked at lingerie brand Victoria\u2019s Secret, before Next became its UK distributor for last year. On Wednesday, Next announced that it had bought a 25% stake in the Reiss fashion brand for \u00a333m. The group will now manage Reiss\u2019s distribution systems and website with the aim of increasing sales in the UK and overseas. The deal will bring former Next executive Christos Angelides, now chief executive of Reiss, back to the firm he left in 2014. Reiss, which operates from 183 outlets in 14 countries, had sales of \u00a3227m last year. The group\u2019s current owners \u2013 including the Reiss family and investment firm Warburg Pincus \u2013 will all remain shareholders. Next has an option to acquire an additional 26% stake until July 2022, which would make it the controlling shareholder with 51%.

First, it summoned a demolition squad to go to work on the fabled Marble Arch store in central London. Now it will sell other people\u2019s clothing brands, including in lingerie, the one part of the non-food operation where market share has remained strong over the years. The venture into third-party labels is not quite an overnight revolution, it should be said. It is online-only and there has been some small-scale dabbling already. But the introduction of 10 outside brands in one go, including Hobbs, Jules, Sloggi and Triumph, is billed as the first of many waves. About time, too. M&amp;S has tortured itself and its customers over the years with its attempts to develop in-house brands. Only three can be said to have worked and are staying \u2013 Autograph, Per Una and Goodmove. The rest (the likes of Collezione and Indigo) have been gradually ditched. It would have been better to import partnership-style thinking 20 years ago. The reluctance, presumably, stemmed from the lower profit margins on offer on external brands since, in some cases, M&amp;S will merely be providing a souped-up delivery plus click-and-collect service. But the trend in the online clothing market is firmly away from solo offers and towards platform-style structures. Best to join in. The M&amp;S adventure is less radical than Next\u2019s push of its \u201ctotal platform\u201d unit, which is more like a full-service operation for outside labels, but at least it is happening. Insularity has been one of M&amp;S\u2019s many problems. As with the purchase of half of Ocado\u2019s UK retail operation, taking a risk seems the right approach. The Restaurant Group\u2019s post-pandemic prospects look more tasty Andy Hornby, at the helm when HBOS hit the rocks, is clearly better at saving casual dining chains than large banks. The pandemic prospects for The Restaurant Group (TRG), where he is the chief executive of the owner of Wagamama and Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s, looked poor a year ago. A \u00a357m fundraising last April was priced at a distressed 58p, versus 135p-ish before Covid struck. Wednesday\u2019s \u00a3175m call on shareholders \u2013 the main course, as it were \u2013 was pitched a far more respectable 100p. What\u2019s happened in the interim? Well, Hornby has performed a decent rescue job. The company has closed the tired Garfunkel\u2019s format, plus a lot of other sites, and obliged landlords to take some pain at Frankie &amp; Benny\u2019s. The net result is a business with 400 outlets, rather than 650, meaning Wagamama \u2013 the reliable bit, and acquired only in 2018 \u2013 is now a bigger part of the whole. Fresh equity will make any future consumer lockdown more bearable and, more immediately, will de-risk the balance sheet. TRG is carrying \u00a3400m of debt, a legacy not just of Covid but also of the Wagamama purchase, and is paying an uncomfortable 6% to borrow. If the company can make top-line operating profits of \u00a3100m-\u00a3115m in 2022, which is what the analysts predict, the debt ratios would look normal again after this fundraising. All one can wish now is that TRG stops banging on about how Hornby and his fellow executives sacrificed a portion of their salaries during the crisis. Come on, they had no choice while the workforce was being shrunk by 4,500. More to the point, the share options Hornby was controversially awarded last October have doubled in value. Royal Mail delivers extraordinary turnaround A year ago, Royal Mail\u2019s share price had slumped to 135p and it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine that a political crisis might develop. After all, the chairman, Keith Williams, would soon warn that the UK business \u2013 in other words, the Royal Mail part, as opposed to the GLS international operation \u2013 was losing \u00a31m a day with the plunge in the volume of letters. The share price now is 490p, an extraordinary turnaround. The boom in parcels has more than compensated for the decline in letters, which itself has turned out to be less severe than feared. The net result is that Royal Mail in the UK will now be profitable in the financial year that ends this month. In total, the group said on Wednesday, full-year operating profits are expected to arrive at \u00a3700m, an upgrade of about \u00a3150m on the estimate of only a month ago. The extended lockdown has helped. One lucky \u2013 or far-sighted \u2013 beneficiary is Daniel K\u0159et\u00ednsk\u00fd, the Czech billionaire who caught the bottom of the share price, more or less, and accumulated a 14% stake, now worth \u00a3690m.
